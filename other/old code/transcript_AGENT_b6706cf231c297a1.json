I guess I've been overextending myself, perhaps more concerned about everyone else's needs than my own. Sleep's been hit or miss, really, as I find myself lying awake with worry about not living up to others' expectations. Overall, sometimes there\u2019s this heavy, empathetic sadness \u2013 especially when I think about my relationships and how I might be letting people down."

    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Honestly, sleep has been pretty difficult. I tend to sleep lightly and wake up frequently, often worrying about things I've said or done and their impact on others. Some nights it's hard to get any restful sleep, and the fatigue just accumulates. I suppose it's just been a lot of restless nights lately."

      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yes, I often feel sluggish and drained. There are moments when I seem to run on autopilot, just trying to get through the day. Occasionally, I feel restless too, like I should be doing more, helping more\u2014but I end up just feeling stuck and exhausted."

I might start thinking about one thing and then catch myself drifting into worries about whether I've adequately supported someone. It makes decision-making tough since I get tied up in thinking about the repercussions of my choices on others."

      "role": "user",
