Most days are pretty structured for me\u2014I stick to a regular schedule with classes and studying. I usually spend time at home with family in the evenings. Lately, balancing academic responsibilities and keeping up with everything at home can feel a bit overwhelming, and that sometimes makes it harder to focus or stay on top of things.

Over the same time period, have you noticed any changes in your interest or enjoyment in things you usually like to do\u2014have you lost interest in activities or felt less pleasure when doing them?\nPatient: Occasionally, I notice that I don\u2019t enjoy certain activities as much, usually when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. It\u2019s not something that happens all the time, though, and I\u2019m still able to find pleasure in things I usually like most of the time.

I\u2019m open to discussing things a bit, and I understand the importance of these conversations. I\u2019m comfortable with going at a steady pace and answering your questions as we go.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, and I appreciate your openness. To get a sense of your routine and what life looks like these days, could you walk me through a typical day for you, including anything that tends to cause stress or helps you manage it?\nPatient: Sure. Most days are pretty structured for me\u2014I stick to a regular schedule with classes and studying. I usually spend time at home with family in the evenings. Lately, balancing academic responsibilities and keeping up with everything at home can feel a bit overwhelming, and that sometimes makes it harder to focus or stay on top of things. When I start to feel stressed, taking a walk or listening to music makes things a bit more manageable, even if it\u2019s just for a short time. Overall, I try to keep my day as steady as possible.\nDoctor: It sounds like finding balance can be tough at times. How often would you say you feel that sense of being overwhelmed, and has it gotten more frequent or intense lately?\nPatient: I do get that overwhelmed feeling now and then, mostly when there\u2019s a lot happening with school or family commitments at once. It isn\u2019t constant, and I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s gotten significantly worse recently\u2014just that there are periods where the stress is heavier. It tends to come and go depending on what\u2019s expected of me at the time.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that with me. Over the past couple of weeks, have you noticed yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless more often than usual?\nPatient: There have been some times in the past couple of weeks where I\u2019ve felt a bit down or discouraged, especially when things start piling up. But it\u2019s not all the time, and those feelings tend to come and go. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s been constant or very intense\u2014just that stress can sometimes make my mood dip a little temporarily.\nDoctor: That makes sense, thank you for your honesty. Over the same time period, have you noticed any changes in your interest or enjoyment in things you usually like to do\u2014have you lost interest in activities or felt less pleasure when doing them?\nPatient: Occasionally, I notice that I don\u2019t enjoy certain activities as much, usually when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. It\u2019s not something that happens all the time, though, and I\u2019m still able to find pleasure in things I usually like most of the time. So, there are moments when it\u2019s harder to get into things, but it isn\u2019t a constant issue.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that detail. How have you been sleeping lately\u2014have you had any problems with falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much?\nPatient: Sleep has been a bit off at times lately. There are nights when I have trouble falling asleep or I wake up more often than usual, and occasionally I end up sleeping a bit more than I planned if I\u2019m really tired. Usually, these issues show up more when I\u2019m stressed out, but it\u2019s not an every night problem. Overall, I can manage, though it\u2019s not quite as consistent as I\u2019d like.\nDoctor: Thank you for explaining that. In terms of your appetite or weight, have you noticed any significant changes lately\u2014like eating a lot more or less than usual, or any shifts in your weight that weren\u2019t intentional?\nPatient: I have noticed occasional changes in my appetite, mostly during times when I\u2019m feeling more stressed.

It\u2019s not something that happens all the time, though, and I\u2019m still able to find pleasure in things I usually like most of the time. So, there are moments when it\u2019s harder to get into things, but it isn\u2019t a constant issue.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that detail. How have you been sleeping lately\u2014have you had any problems with falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much?\nPatient: Sleep has been a bit off at times lately. There are nights when I have trouble falling asleep or I wake up more often than usual, and occasionally I end up sleeping a bit more than I planned if I\u2019m really tired. Usually, these issues show up more when I\u2019m stressed out, but it\u2019s not an every night problem. Overall, I can manage, though it\u2019s not quite as consistent as I\u2019d like.\nDoctor: Thank you for explaining that. In terms of your appetite or weight, have you noticed any significant changes lately\u2014like eating a lot more or less than usual, or any shifts in your weight that weren\u2019t intentional?\nPatient: I have noticed occasional changes in my appetite, mostly during times when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. Sometimes I eat less without really thinking about it, or other times I might snack more than usual. There have been slight shifts in my weight, but nothing dramatic or constant. It seems to come and go, depending on how things are going overall.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that.

I\u2019m open to discussing things a bit, and I understand the importance of these conversations. I\u2019m comfortable with going at a steady pace and answering your questions as we go.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, and I appreciate your openness. To get a sense of your routine and what life looks like these days, could you walk me through a typical day for you, including anything that tends to cause stress or helps you manage it?\nPatient: Sure. Most days are pretty structured for me\u2014I stick to a regular schedule with classes and studying. I usually spend time at home with family in the evenings. Lately, balancing academic responsibilities and keeping up with everything at home can feel a bit overwhelming, and that sometimes makes it harder to focus or stay on top of things. When I start to feel stressed, taking a walk or listening to music makes things a bit more manageable, even if it\u2019s just for a short time. Overall, I try to keep my day as steady as possible.\nDoctor: It sounds like finding balance can be tough at times. How often would you say you feel that sense of being overwhelmed, and has it gotten more frequent or intense lately?\nPatient: I do get that overwhelmed feeling now and then, mostly when there\u2019s a lot happening with school or family commitments at once. It isn\u2019t constant, and I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s gotten significantly worse recently\u2014just that there are periods where the stress is heavier. It tends to come and go depending on what\u2019s expected of me at the time.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that with me. Over the past couple of weeks, have you noticed yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless more often than usual?\nPatient: There have been some times in the past couple of weeks where I\u2019ve felt a bit down or discouraged, especially when things start piling up. But it\u2019s not all the time, and those feelings tend to come and go. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s been constant or very intense\u2014just that stress can sometimes make my mood dip a little temporarily.\nDoctor: That makes sense, thank you for your honesty. Over the same time period, have you noticed any changes in your interest or enjoyment in things you usually like to do\u2014have you lost interest in activities or felt less pleasure when doing them?\nPatient: Occasionally, I notice that I don\u2019t enjoy certain activities as much, usually when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. It\u2019s not something that happens all the time, though, and I\u2019m still able to find pleasure in things I usually like most of the time. So, there are moments when it\u2019s harder to get into things, but it isn\u2019t a constant issue.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that detail. How have you been sleeping lately\u2014have you had any problems with falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much?\nPatient: Sleep has been a bit off at times lately. There are nights when I have trouble falling asleep or I wake up more often than usual, and occasionally I end up sleeping a bit more than I planned if I\u2019m really tired. Usually, these issues show up more when I\u2019m stressed out, but it\u2019s not an every night problem. Overall, I can manage, though it\u2019s not quite as consistent as I\u2019d like.\nDoctor: Thank you for explaining that. In terms of your appetite or weight, have you noticed any significant changes lately\u2014like eating a lot more or less than usual, or any shifts in your weight that weren\u2019t intentional?\nPatient: I have noticed occasional changes in my appetite, mostly during times when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. Sometimes I eat less without really thinking about it, or other times I might snack more than usual. There have been slight shifts in my weight, but nothing dramatic or constant. It seems to come and go, depending on how things are going overall.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. Lately, have you noticed feeling unusually tired or low on energy, even after getting some rest, or is your energy level about the same as usual?\nPatient: There are some days when I feel more tired or low on energy, particularly if things have been more hectic or stressful. It\u2019s not something I deal with all the time, though\u2014most days my energy level is about the same as usual. So it occasionally crops up, but hasn\u2019t become a constant or major issue.\nDoctor: Thank you for being clear about that. Have you had any trouble with concentrating, staying focused, or making decisions recently\u2014like your mind is more distracted than usual?\nPatient: Yes, I have been noticing more trouble with concentration lately. My mind tends to feel more distracted, especially when there\u2019s a lot going on. Decision-making has also gotten a bit harder at times\u2014it just takes longer for me to sort things out mentally when I\u2019m dealing with stress.

I'd like to check in with you about a few things today.\nPatient: Thank you. That\u2019s okay with me\u2014I appreciate you wanting to check in. I\u2019m open to discussing things a bit, and I understand the importance of these conversations. I\u2019m comfortable with going at a steady pace and answering your questions as we go.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, and I appreciate your openness. To get a sense of your routine and what life looks like these days, could you walk me through a typical day for you, including anything that tends to cause stress or helps you manage it?\nPatient: Sure. Most days are pretty structured for me\u2014I stick to a regular schedule with classes and studying. I usually spend time at home with family in the evenings. Lately, balancing academic responsibilities and keeping up with everything at home can feel a bit overwhelming, and that sometimes makes it harder to focus or stay on top of things. When I start to feel stressed, taking a walk or listening to music makes things a bit more manageable, even if it\u2019s just for a short time. Overall, I try to keep my day as steady as possible.\nDoctor: It sounds like finding balance can be tough at times. How often would you say you feel that sense of being overwhelmed, and has it gotten more frequent or intense lately?\nPatient: I do get that overwhelmed feeling now and then, mostly when there\u2019s a lot happening with school or family commitments at once. It isn\u2019t constant, and I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s gotten significantly worse recently\u2014just that there are periods where the stress is heavier. It tends to come and go depending on what\u2019s expected of me at the time.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that with me. Over the past couple of weeks, have you noticed yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless more often than usual?\nPatient: There have been some times in the past couple of weeks where I\u2019ve felt a bit down or discouraged, especially when things start piling up. But it\u2019s not all the time, and those feelings tend to come and go. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s been constant or very intense\u2014just that stress can sometimes make my mood dip a little temporarily.\nDoctor: That makes sense, thank you for your honesty. Over the same time period, have you noticed any changes in your interest or enjoyment in things you usually like to do\u2014have you lost interest in activities or felt less pleasure when doing them?\nPatient: Occasionally, I notice that I don\u2019t enjoy certain activities as much, usually when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. It\u2019s not something that happens all the time, though, and I\u2019m still able to find pleasure in things I usually like most of the time. So, there are moments when it\u2019s harder to get into things, but it isn\u2019t a constant issue.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that detail. How have you been sleeping lately\u2014have you had any problems with falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much?\nPatient: Sleep has been a bit off at times lately. There are nights when I have trouble falling asleep or I wake up more often than usual, and occasionally I end up sleeping a bit more than I planned if I\u2019m really tired. Usually, these issues show up more when I\u2019m stressed out, but it\u2019s not an every night problem. Overall, I can manage, though it\u2019s not quite as consistent as I\u2019d like.\nDoctor: Thank you for explaining that. In terms of your appetite or weight, have you noticed any significant changes lately\u2014like eating a lot more or less than usual, or any shifts in your weight that weren\u2019t intentional?\nPatient: I have noticed occasional changes in my appetite, mostly during times when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. Sometimes I eat less without really thinking about it, or other times I might snack more than usual. There have been slight shifts in my weight, but nothing dramatic or constant. It seems to come and go, depending on how things are going overall.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. Lately, have you noticed feeling unusually tired or low on energy, even after getting some rest, or is your energy level about the same as usual?\nPatient: There are some days when I feel more tired or low on energy, particularly if things have been more hectic or stressful. It\u2019s not something I deal with all the time, though\u2014most days my energy level is about the same as usual. So it occasionally crops up, but hasn\u2019t become a constant or major issue.\nDoctor: Thank you for being clear about that. Have you had any trouble with concentrating, staying focused, or making decisions recently\u2014like your mind is more distracted than usual?\nPatient: Yes, I have been noticing more trouble with concentration lately. My mind tends to feel more distracted, especially when there\u2019s a lot going on. Decision-making has also gotten a bit harder at times\u2014it just takes longer for me to sort things out mentally when I\u2019m dealing with stress. It\u2019s been a recurring issue, but I try to work through it as best I can.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds challenging. Could you tell me a bit more about how often these concentration difficulties come up and whether they're affecting important parts of your daily life, like schoolwork or relationships?\nPatient: These concentration difficulties come up fairly often, especially when I\u2019m under more stress. It can make it harder to keep up with schoolwork or slows me down when I\u2019m trying to finish assignments. With relationships, sometimes it affects how well I listen or engage in conversations, but I haven\u2019t noticed it causing any major problems\u2014just that I\u2019m not always as present as I\u2019d like to be.

I'd like to check in with you about a few things today.\nPatient: Thank you. That\u2019s okay with me\u2014I appreciate you wanting to check in. I\u2019m open to discussing things a bit, and I understand the importance of these conversations. I\u2019m comfortable with going at a steady pace and answering your questions as we go.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, and I appreciate your openness. To get a sense of your routine and what life looks like these days, could you walk me through a typical day for you, including anything that tends to cause stress or helps you manage it?\nPatient: Sure. Most days are pretty structured for me\u2014I stick to a regular schedule with classes and studying. I usually spend time at home with family in the evenings. Lately, balancing academic responsibilities and keeping up with everything at home can feel a bit overwhelming, and that sometimes makes it harder to focus or stay on top of things. When I start to feel stressed, taking a walk or listening to music makes things a bit more manageable, even if it\u2019s just for a short time. Overall, I try to keep my day as steady as possible.\nDoctor: It sounds like finding balance can be tough at times. How often would you say you feel that sense of being overwhelmed, and has it gotten more frequent or intense lately?\nPatient: I do get that overwhelmed feeling now and then, mostly when there\u2019s a lot happening with school or family commitments at once. It isn\u2019t constant, and I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s gotten significantly worse recently\u2014just that there are periods where the stress is heavier. It tends to come and go depending on what\u2019s expected of me at the time.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that with me. Over the past couple of weeks, have you noticed yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless more often than usual?\nPatient: There have been some times in the past couple of weeks where I\u2019ve felt a bit down or discouraged, especially when things start piling up. But it\u2019s not all the time, and those feelings tend to come and go. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s been constant or very intense\u2014just that stress can sometimes make my mood dip a little temporarily.\nDoctor: That makes sense, thank you for your honesty. Over the same time period, have you noticed any changes in your interest or enjoyment in things you usually like to do\u2014have you lost interest in activities or felt less pleasure when doing them?\nPatient: Occasionally, I notice that I don\u2019t enjoy certain activities as much, usually when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. It\u2019s not something that happens all the time, though, and I\u2019m still able to find pleasure in things I usually like most of the time. So, there are moments when it\u2019s harder to get into things, but it isn\u2019t a constant issue.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that detail. How have you been sleeping lately\u2014have you had any problems with falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much?\nPatient: Sleep has been a bit off at times lately. There are nights when I have trouble falling asleep or I wake up more often than usual, and occasionally I end up sleeping a bit more than I planned if I\u2019m really tired. Usually, these issues show up more when I\u2019m stressed out, but it\u2019s not an every night problem. Overall, I can manage, though it\u2019s not quite as consistent as I\u2019d like.\nDoctor: Thank you for explaining that. In terms of your appetite or weight, have you noticed any significant changes lately\u2014like eating a lot more or less than usual, or any shifts in your weight that weren\u2019t intentional?\nPatient: I have noticed occasional changes in my appetite, mostly during times when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. Sometimes I eat less without really thinking about it, or other times I might snack more than usual. There have been slight shifts in my weight, but nothing dramatic or constant. It seems to come and go, depending on how things are going overall.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. Lately, have you noticed feeling unusually tired or low on energy, even after getting some rest, or is your energy level about the same as usual?\nPatient: There are some days when I feel more tired or low on energy, particularly if things have been more hectic or stressful. It\u2019s not something I deal with all the time, though\u2014most days my energy level is about the same as usual. So it occasionally crops up, but hasn\u2019t become a constant or major issue.\nDoctor: Thank you for being clear about that. Have you had any trouble with concentrating, staying focused, or making decisions recently\u2014like your mind is more distracted than usual?\nPatient: Yes, I have been noticing more trouble with concentration lately. My mind tends to feel more distracted, especially when there\u2019s a lot going on. Decision-making has also gotten a bit harder at times\u2014it just takes longer for me to sort things out mentally when I\u2019m dealing with stress. It\u2019s been a recurring issue, but I try to work through it as best I can.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds challenging. Could you tell me a bit more about how often these concentration difficulties come up and whether they're affecting important parts of your daily life, like schoolwork or relationships?\nPatient: These concentration difficulties come up fairly often, especially when I\u2019m under more stress. It can make it harder to keep up with schoolwork or slows me down when I\u2019m trying to finish assignments. With relationships, sometimes it affects how well I listen or engage in conversations, but I haven\u2019t noticed it causing any major problems\u2014just that I\u2019m not always as present as I\u2019d like to be. Overall, it\u2019s noticeable, but I\u2019m trying to manage it.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about how this has affected you. In the past couple of weeks, have you found yourself feeling unusually down on yourself, worthless, or struggling with a lot of guilt over things that might not usually bother you?\nPatient: Yes, I have felt down on myself at times lately, and there are moments when I experience some guilt, especially when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. These feelings aren\u2019t constant, but they are noticeable when things get overwhelming. They tend to show up more when I\u2019m under pressure, but they\u2019re not there all the time.\nDoctor: Thank you for letting me know. When these feelings of being down on yourself or experiencing guilt do show up, how intense would you say they are, and do they ever affect your motivation or how you interact with others?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThank you for letting me know.

I'd like to check in with you about a few things today.\nPatient: Thank you. That\u2019s okay with me\u2014I appreciate you wanting to check in. I\u2019m open to discussing things a bit, and I understand the importance of these conversations. I\u2019m comfortable with going at a steady pace and answering your questions as we go.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, and I appreciate your openness. To get a sense of your routine and what life looks like these days, could you walk me through a typical day for you, including anything that tends to cause stress or helps you manage it?\nPatient: Sure. Most days are pretty structured for me\u2014I stick to a regular schedule with classes and studying. I usually spend time at home with family in the evenings. Lately, balancing academic responsibilities and keeping up with everything at home can feel a bit overwhelming, and that sometimes makes it harder to focus or stay on top of things. When I start to feel stressed, taking a walk or listening to music makes things a bit more manageable, even if it\u2019s just for a short time. Overall, I try to keep my day as steady as possible.\nDoctor: It sounds like finding balance can be tough at times. How often would you say you feel that sense of being overwhelmed, and has it gotten more frequent or intense lately?\nPatient: I do get that overwhelmed feeling now and then, mostly when there\u2019s a lot happening with school or family commitments at once. It isn\u2019t constant, and I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s gotten significantly worse recently\u2014just that there are periods where the stress is heavier. It tends to come and go depending on what\u2019s expected of me at the time.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that with me. Over the past couple of weeks, have you noticed yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless more often than usual?\nPatient: There have been some times in the past couple of weeks where I\u2019ve felt a bit down or discouraged, especially when things start piling up. But it\u2019s not all the time, and those feelings tend to come and go. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s been constant or very intense\u2014just that stress can sometimes make my mood dip a little temporarily.\nDoctor: That makes sense, thank you for your honesty. Over the same time period, have you noticed any changes in your interest or enjoyment in things you usually like to do\u2014have you lost interest in activities or felt less pleasure when doing them?\nPatient: Occasionally, I notice that I don\u2019t enjoy certain activities as much, usually when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. It\u2019s not something that happens all the time, though, and I\u2019m still able to find pleasure in things I usually like most of the time. So, there are moments when it\u2019s harder to get into things, but it isn\u2019t a constant issue.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that detail. How have you been sleeping lately\u2014have you had any problems with falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much?\nPatient: Sleep has been a bit off at times lately. There are nights when I have trouble falling asleep or I wake up more often than usual, and occasionally I end up sleeping a bit more than I planned if I\u2019m really tired. Usually, these issues show up more when I\u2019m stressed out, but it\u2019s not an every night problem. Overall, I can manage, though it\u2019s not quite as consistent as I\u2019d like.\nDoctor: Thank you for explaining that. In terms of your appetite or weight, have you noticed any significant changes lately\u2014like eating a lot more or less than usual, or any shifts in your weight that weren\u2019t intentional?\nPatient: I have noticed occasional changes in my appetite, mostly during times when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. Sometimes I eat less without really thinking about it, or other times I might snack more than usual. There have been slight shifts in my weight, but nothing dramatic or constant. It seems to come and go, depending on how things are going overall.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. Lately, have you noticed feeling unusually tired or low on energy, even after getting some rest, or is your energy level about the same as usual?\nPatient: There are some days when I feel more tired or low on energy, particularly if things have been more hectic or stressful. It\u2019s not something I deal with all the time, though\u2014most days my energy level is about the same as usual. So it occasionally crops up, but hasn\u2019t become a constant or major issue.\nDoctor: Thank you for being clear about that. Have you had any trouble with concentrating, staying focused, or making decisions recently\u2014like your mind is more distracted than usual?\nPatient: Yes, I have been noticing more trouble with concentration lately. My mind tends to feel more distracted, especially when there\u2019s a lot going on. Decision-making has also gotten a bit harder at times\u2014it just takes longer for me to sort things out mentally when I\u2019m dealing with stress. It\u2019s been a recurring issue, but I try to work through it as best I can.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds challenging. Could you tell me a bit more about how often these concentration difficulties come up and whether they're affecting important parts of your daily life, like schoolwork or relationships?\nPatient: These concentration difficulties come up fairly often, especially when I\u2019m under more stress. It can make it harder to keep up with schoolwork or slows me down when I\u2019m trying to finish assignments. With relationships, sometimes it affects how well I listen or engage in conversations, but I haven\u2019t noticed it causing any major problems\u2014just that I\u2019m not always as present as I\u2019d like to be. Overall, it\u2019s noticeable, but I\u2019m trying to manage it.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about how this has affected you. In the past couple of weeks, have you found yourself feeling unusually down on yourself, worthless, or struggling with a lot of guilt over things that might not usually bother you?\nPatient: Yes, I have felt down on myself at times lately, and there are moments when I experience some guilt, especially when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. These feelings aren\u2019t constant, but they are noticeable when things get overwhelming. They tend to show up more when I\u2019m under pressure, but they\u2019re not there all the time.\nDoctor: Thank you for letting me know. When these feelings of being down on yourself or experiencing guilt do show up, how intense would you say they are, and do they ever affect your motivation or how you interact with others?\nPatient: At times, those feelings can get fairly intense, particularly when I\u2019m under a lot of pressure. They do sometimes affect my motivation\u2014it\u2019s harder to get started or keep up momentum when I\u2019m really doubting myself. They also make me less engaged or less talkative around other people, but it hasn\u2019t gotten to a level where I\u2019m consistently having major problems with relationships or daily routines.\nDoctor: Thank you for your honesty. I need to ask: in the past couple of weeks, have you had any thoughts that life isn\u2019t worth living, or had thoughts about death or suicide?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThank you for your honesty.

I\u2019m open to discussing things a bit, and I understand the importance of these conversations. I\u2019m comfortable with going at a steady pace and answering your questions as we go.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, and I appreciate your openness. To get a sense of your routine and what life looks like these days, could you walk me through a typical day for you, including anything that tends to cause stress or helps you manage it?\nPatient: Sure. Most days are pretty structured for me\u2014I stick to a regular schedule with classes and studying. I usually spend time at home with family in the evenings. Lately, balancing academic responsibilities and keeping up with everything at home can feel a bit overwhelming, and that sometimes makes it harder to focus or stay on top of things. When I start to feel stressed, taking a walk or listening to music makes things a bit more manageable, even if it\u2019s just for a short time. Overall, I try to keep my day as steady as possible.\nDoctor: It sounds like finding balance can be tough at times. How often would you say you feel that sense of being overwhelmed, and has it gotten more frequent or intense lately?\nPatient: I do get that overwhelmed feeling now and then, mostly when there\u2019s a lot happening with school or family commitments at once. It isn\u2019t constant, and I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s gotten significantly worse recently\u2014just that there are periods where the stress is heavier. It tends to come and go depending on what\u2019s expected of me at the time.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that with me. Over the past couple of weeks, have you noticed yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless more often than usual?\nPatient: There have been some times in the past couple of weeks where I\u2019ve felt a bit down or discouraged, especially when things start piling up. But it\u2019s not all the time, and those feelings tend to come and go. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s been constant or very intense\u2014just that stress can sometimes make my mood dip a little temporarily.\nDoctor: That makes sense, thank you for your honesty. Over the same time period, have you noticed any changes in your interest or enjoyment in things you usually like to do\u2014have you lost interest in activities or felt less pleasure when doing them?\nPatient: Occasionally, I notice that I don\u2019t enjoy certain activities as much, usually when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. It\u2019s not something that happens all the time, though, and I\u2019m still able to find pleasure in things I usually like most of the time. So, there are moments when it\u2019s harder to get into things, but it isn\u2019t a constant issue.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that detail. How have you been sleeping lately\u2014have you had any problems with falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much?\nPatient: Sleep has been a bit off at times lately. There are nights when I have trouble falling asleep or I wake up more often than usual, and occasionally I end up sleeping a bit more than I planned if I\u2019m really tired. Usually, these issues show up more when I\u2019m stressed out, but it\u2019s not an every night problem. Overall, I can manage, though it\u2019s not quite as consistent as I\u2019d like.\nDoctor: Thank you for explaining that. In terms of your appetite or weight, have you noticed any significant changes lately\u2014like eating a lot more or less than usual, or any shifts in your weight that weren\u2019t intentional?\nPatient: I have noticed occasional changes in my appetite, mostly during times when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. Sometimes I eat less without really thinking about it, or other times I might snack more than usual. There have been slight shifts in my weight, but nothing dramatic or constant. It seems to come and go, depending on how things are going overall.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. Lately, have you noticed feeling unusually tired or low on energy, even after getting some rest, or is your energy level about the same as usual?\nPatient: There are some days when I feel more tired or low on energy, particularly if things have been more hectic or stressful. It\u2019s not something I deal with all the time, though\u2014most days my energy level is about the same as usual. So it occasionally crops up, but hasn\u2019t become a constant or major issue.\nDoctor: Thank you for being clear about that. Have you had any trouble with concentrating, staying focused, or making decisions recently\u2014like your mind is more distracted than usual?\nPatient: Yes, I have been noticing more trouble with concentration lately. My mind tends to feel more distracted, especially when there\u2019s a lot going on. Decision-making has also gotten a bit harder at times\u2014it just takes longer for me to sort things out mentally when I\u2019m dealing with stress. It\u2019s been a recurring issue, but I try to work through it as best I can.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds challenging. Could you tell me a bit more about how often these concentration difficulties come up and whether they're affecting important parts of your daily life, like schoolwork or relationships?\nPatient: These concentration difficulties come up fairly often, especially when I\u2019m under more stress. It can make it harder to keep up with schoolwork or slows me down when I\u2019m trying to finish assignments. With relationships, sometimes it affects how well I listen or engage in conversations, but I haven\u2019t noticed it causing any major problems\u2014just that I\u2019m not always as present as I\u2019d like to be. Overall, it\u2019s noticeable, but I\u2019m trying to manage it.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about how this has affected you. In the past couple of weeks, have you found yourself feeling unusually down on yourself, worthless, or struggling with a lot of guilt over things that might not usually bother you?\nPatient: Yes, I have felt down on myself at times lately, and there are moments when I experience some guilt, especially when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. These feelings aren\u2019t constant, but they are noticeable when things get overwhelming. They tend to show up more when I\u2019m under pressure, but they\u2019re not there all the time.\nDoctor: Thank you for letting me know. When these feelings of being down on yourself or experiencing guilt do show up, how intense would you say they are, and do they ever affect your motivation or how you interact with others?\nPatient: At times, those feelings can get fairly intense, particularly when I\u2019m under a lot of pressure. They do sometimes affect my motivation\u2014it\u2019s harder to get started or keep up momentum when I\u2019m really doubting myself. They also make me less engaged or less talkative around other people, but it hasn\u2019t gotten to a level where I\u2019m consistently having major problems with relationships or daily routines.\nDoctor: Thank you for your honesty. I need to ask: in the past couple of weeks, have you had any thoughts that life isn\u2019t worth living, or had thoughts about death or suicide?\nPatient: I have had some occasional thoughts about death or just feeling overwhelmed to the point where it crosses my mind, especially when things are particularly stressful. These thoughts tend to be fleeting\u2014they aren\u2019t constant, and I don\u2019t have any plans or intent to hurt myself.

When these feelings of being down on yourself or experiencing guilt do show up, how intense would you say they are, and do they ever affect your motivation or how you interact with others?\nPatient: At times, those feelings can get fairly intense, particularly when I\u2019m under a lot of pressure.

I need to ask: in the past couple of weeks, have you had any thoughts that life isn\u2019t worth living, or had thoughts about death or suicide?\nPatient: I have had some occasional thoughts about death or just feeling overwhelmed to the point where it crosses my mind, especially when things are particularly stressful. These thoughts tend to be fleeting\u2014they aren\u2019t constant, and I don\u2019t have any plans or intent to hurt myself.

When these thoughts about death or feeling overwhelmed come up, how often does that tend to happen, and is there anything in particular that helps you manage or move past them?\nPatient: Those kinds of thoughts come up from time to time, particularly when I feel really overwhelmed, but they aren\u2019t a constant part of my day.

I\u2019m open to discussing things a bit, and I understand the importance of these conversations. I\u2019m comfortable with going at a steady pace and answering your questions as we go.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, and I appreciate your openness. To get a sense of your routine and what life looks like these days, could you walk me through a typical day for you, including anything that tends to cause stress or helps you manage it?\nPatient: Sure. Most days are pretty structured for me\u2014I stick to a regular schedule with classes and studying. I usually spend time at home with family in the evenings. Lately, balancing academic responsibilities and keeping up with everything at home can feel a bit overwhelming, and that sometimes makes it harder to focus or stay on top of things. When I start to feel stressed, taking a walk or listening to music makes things a bit more manageable, even if it\u2019s just for a short time. Overall, I try to keep my day as steady as possible.\nDoctor: It sounds like finding balance can be tough at times. How often would you say you feel that sense of being overwhelmed, and has it gotten more frequent or intense lately?\nPatient: I do get that overwhelmed feeling now and then, mostly when there\u2019s a lot happening with school or family commitments at once. It isn\u2019t constant, and I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s gotten significantly worse recently\u2014just that there are periods where the stress is heavier. It tends to come and go depending on what\u2019s expected of me at the time.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that with me. Over the past couple of weeks, have you noticed yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless more often than usual?\nPatient: There have been some times in the past couple of weeks where I\u2019ve felt a bit down or discouraged, especially when things start piling up. But it\u2019s not all the time, and those feelings tend to come and go. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s been constant or very intense\u2014just that stress can sometimes make my mood dip a little temporarily.\nDoctor: That makes sense, thank you for your honesty. Over the same time period, have you noticed any changes in your interest or enjoyment in things you usually like to do\u2014have you lost interest in activities or felt less pleasure when doing them?\nPatient: Occasionally, I notice that I don\u2019t enjoy certain activities as much, usually when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. It\u2019s not something that happens all the time, though, and I\u2019m still able to find pleasure in things I usually like most of the time. So, there are moments when it\u2019s harder to get into things, but it isn\u2019t a constant issue.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that detail. How have you been sleeping lately\u2014have you had any problems with falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much?\nPatient: Sleep has been a bit off at times lately. There are nights when I have trouble falling asleep or I wake up more often than usual, and occasionally I end up sleeping a bit more than I planned if I\u2019m really tired. Usually, these issues show up more when I\u2019m stressed out, but it\u2019s not an every night problem. Overall, I can manage, though it\u2019s not quite as consistent as I\u2019d like.\nDoctor: Thank you for explaining that. In terms of your appetite or weight, have you noticed any significant changes lately\u2014like eating a lot more or less than usual, or any shifts in your weight that weren\u2019t intentional?\nPatient: I have noticed occasional changes in my appetite, mostly during times when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. Sometimes I eat less without really thinking about it, or other times I might snack more than usual. There have been slight shifts in my weight, but nothing dramatic or constant. It seems to come and go, depending on how things are going overall.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. Lately, have you noticed feeling unusually tired or low on energy, even after getting some rest, or is your energy level about the same as usual?\nPatient: There are some days when I feel more tired or low on energy, particularly if things have been more hectic or stressful. It\u2019s not something I deal with all the time, though\u2014most days my energy level is about the same as usual. So it occasionally crops up, but hasn\u2019t become a constant or major issue.\nDoctor: Thank you for being clear about that. Have you had any trouble with concentrating, staying focused, or making decisions recently\u2014like your mind is more distracted than usual?\nPatient: Yes, I have been noticing more trouble with concentration lately. My mind tends to feel more distracted, especially when there\u2019s a lot going on. Decision-making has also gotten a bit harder at times\u2014it just takes longer for me to sort things out mentally when I\u2019m dealing with stress. It\u2019s been a recurring issue, but I try to work through it as best I can.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds challenging. Could you tell me a bit more about how often these concentration difficulties come up and whether they're affecting important parts of your daily life, like schoolwork or relationships?\nPatient: These concentration difficulties come up fairly often, especially when I\u2019m under more stress. It can make it harder to keep up with schoolwork or slows me down when I\u2019m trying to finish assignments. With relationships, sometimes it affects how well I listen or engage in conversations, but I haven\u2019t noticed it causing any major problems\u2014just that I\u2019m not always as present as I\u2019d like to be. Overall, it\u2019s noticeable, but I\u2019m trying to manage it.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about how this has affected you. In the past couple of weeks, have you found yourself feeling unusually down on yourself, worthless, or struggling with a lot of guilt over things that might not usually bother you?\nPatient: Yes, I have felt down on myself at times lately, and there are moments when I experience some guilt, especially when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. These feelings aren\u2019t constant, but they are noticeable when things get overwhelming. They tend to show up more when I\u2019m under pressure, but they\u2019re not there all the time.\nDoctor: Thank you for letting me know. When these feelings of being down on yourself or experiencing guilt do show up, how intense would you say they are, and do they ever affect your motivation or how you interact with others?\nPatient: At times, those feelings can get fairly intense, particularly when I\u2019m under a lot of pressure. They do sometimes affect my motivation\u2014it\u2019s harder to get started or keep up momentum when I\u2019m really doubting myself.

These thoughts tend to be fleeting\u2014they aren\u2019t constant, and I don\u2019t have any plans or intent to hurt myself.

Usually, these issues show up more when I\u2019m stressed out, but it\u2019s not an every night problem. Overall, I can manage, though it\u2019s not quite as consistent as I\u2019d like.\nDoctor: Thank you for explaining that. In terms of your appetite or weight, have you noticed any significant changes lately\u2014like eating a lot more or less than usual, or any shifts in your weight that weren\u2019t intentional?\nPatient: I have noticed occasional changes in my appetite, mostly during times when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. Sometimes I eat less without really thinking about it, or other times I might snack more than usual. There have been slight shifts in my weight, but nothing dramatic or constant. It seems to come and go, depending on how things are going overall.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. Lately, have you noticed feeling unusually tired or low on energy, even after getting some rest, or is your energy level about the same as usual?\nPatient: There are some days when I feel more tired or low on energy, particularly if things have been more hectic or stressful. It\u2019s not something I deal with all the time, though\u2014most days my energy level is about the same as usual. So it occasionally crops up, but hasn\u2019t become a constant or major issue.\nDoctor: Thank you for being clear about that. Have you had any trouble with concentrating, staying focused, or making decisions recently\u2014like your mind is more distracted than usual?\nPatient: Yes, I have been noticing more trouble with concentration lately. My mind tends to feel more distracted, especially when there\u2019s a lot going on. Decision-making has also gotten a bit harder at times\u2014it just takes longer for me to sort things out mentally when I\u2019m dealing with stress. It\u2019s been a recurring issue, but I try to work through it as best I can.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds challenging. Could you tell me a bit more about how often these concentration difficulties come up and whether they're affecting important parts of your daily life, like schoolwork or relationships?\nPatient: These concentration difficulties come up fairly often, especially when I\u2019m under more stress. It can make it harder to keep up with schoolwork or slows me down when I\u2019m trying to finish assignments. With relationships, sometimes it affects how well I listen or engage in conversations, but I haven\u2019t noticed it causing any major problems\u2014just that I\u2019m not always as present as I\u2019d like to be. Overall, it\u2019s noticeable, but I\u2019m trying to manage it.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about how this has affected you. In the past couple of weeks, have you found yourself feeling unusually down on yourself, worthless, or struggling with a lot of guilt over things that might not usually bother you?\nPatient: Yes, I have felt down on myself at times lately, and there are moments when I experience some guilt, especially when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. These feelings aren\u2019t constant, but they are noticeable when things get overwhelming. They tend to show up more when I\u2019m under pressure, but they\u2019re not there all the time.\nDoctor: Thank you for letting me know. When these feelings of being down on yourself or experiencing guilt do show up, how intense would you say they are, and do they ever affect your motivation or how you interact with others?\nPatient: At times, those feelings can get fairly intense, particularly when I\u2019m under a lot of pressure. They do sometimes affect my motivation\u2014it\u2019s harder to get started or keep up momentum when I\u2019m really doubting myself. They also make me less engaged or less talkative around other people, but it hasn\u2019t gotten to a level where I\u2019m consistently having major problems with relationships or daily routines.\nDoctor: Thank you for your honesty. I need to ask: in the past couple of weeks, have you had any thoughts that life isn\u2019t worth living, or had thoughts about death or suicide?\nPatient: I have had some occasional thoughts about death or just feeling overwhelmed to the point where it crosses my mind, especially when things are particularly stressful. These thoughts tend to be fleeting\u2014they aren\u2019t constant, and I don\u2019t have any plans or intent to hurt myself. It\u2019s more a reaction to feeling overloaded than anything else, and not something I act on.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open about that\u2014it\u2019s important to talk about. When these thoughts about death or feeling overwhelmed come up, how often does that tend to happen, and is there anything in particular that helps you manage or move past them?\nPatient: Those kinds of thoughts come up from time to time, particularly when I feel really overwhelmed, but they aren\u2019t a constant part of my day. When they do happen, I usually try to distract myself with something else\u2014like going for a walk, listening to music, or sometimes talking with someone I trust. Those things help me get past it and keep things in perspective.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing how you handle these moments. Outside of those coping strategies you mentioned, is there anything else in your daily life\u2014like hobbies, support from friends or family, or routines\u2014that you feel really helps support your mood or well-being?\nPatient: Yes, having some structure to my routine definitely helps\u2014like sticking to a schedule with classes and daily responsibilities. Spending time with family or friends, even if it\u2019s just for a bit, is also supportive for me.

I\u2019m open to discussing things a bit, and I understand the importance of these conversations. I\u2019m comfortable with going at a steady pace and answering your questions as we go.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, and I appreciate your openness. To get a sense of your routine and what life looks like these days, could you walk me through a typical day for you, including anything that tends to cause stress or helps you manage it?\nPatient: Sure. Most days are pretty structured for me\u2014I stick to a regular schedule with classes and studying. I usually spend time at home with family in the evenings. Lately, balancing academic responsibilities and keeping up with everything at home can feel a bit overwhelming, and that sometimes makes it harder to focus or stay on top of things. When I start to feel stressed, taking a walk or listening to music makes things a bit more manageable, even if it\u2019s just for a short time. Overall, I try to keep my day as steady as possible.\nDoctor: It sounds like finding balance can be tough at times. How often would you say you feel that sense of being overwhelmed, and has it gotten more frequent or intense lately?\nPatient: I do get that overwhelmed feeling now and then, mostly when there\u2019s a lot happening with school or family commitments at once. It isn\u2019t constant, and I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s gotten significantly worse recently\u2014just that there are periods where the stress is heavier. It tends to come and go depending on what\u2019s expected of me at the time.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that with me. Over the past couple of weeks, have you noticed yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless more often than usual?\nPatient: There have been some times in the past couple of weeks where I\u2019ve felt a bit down or discouraged, especially when things start piling up. But it\u2019s not all the time, and those feelings tend to come and go. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s been constant or very intense\u2014just that stress can sometimes make my mood dip a little temporarily.\nDoctor: That makes sense, thank you for your honesty. Over the same time period, have you noticed any changes in your interest or enjoyment in things you usually like to do\u2014have you lost interest in activities or felt less pleasure when doing them?\nPatient: Occasionally, I notice that I don\u2019t enjoy certain activities as much, usually when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. It\u2019s not something that happens all the time, though, and I\u2019m still able to find pleasure in things I usually like most of the time. So, there are moments when it\u2019s harder to get into things, but it isn\u2019t a constant issue.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that detail. How have you been sleeping lately\u2014have you had any problems with falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much?\nPatient: Sleep has been a bit off at times lately.

I'd like to check in with you about a few things today.\nPatient: Thank you. That\u2019s okay with me\u2014I appreciate you wanting to check in. I\u2019m open to discussing things a bit, and I understand the importance of these conversations. I\u2019m comfortable with going at a steady pace and answering your questions as we go.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, and I appreciate your openness. To get a sense of your routine and what life looks like these days, could you walk me through a typical day for you, including anything that tends to cause stress or helps you manage it?\nPatient: Sure. Most days are pretty structured for me\u2014I stick to a regular schedule with classes and studying. I usually spend time at home with family in the evenings. Lately, balancing academic responsibilities and keeping up with everything at home can feel a bit overwhelming, and that sometimes makes it harder to focus or stay on top of things. When I start to feel stressed, taking a walk or listening to music makes things a bit more manageable, even if it\u2019s just for a short time. Overall, I try to keep my day as steady as possible.\nDoctor: It sounds like finding balance can be tough at times. How often would you say you feel that sense of being overwhelmed, and has it gotten more frequent or intense lately?\nPatient: I do get that overwhelmed feeling now and then, mostly when there\u2019s a lot happening with school or family commitments at once. It isn\u2019t constant, and I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s gotten significantly worse recently\u2014just that there are periods where the stress is heavier. It tends to come and go depending on what\u2019s expected of me at the time.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that with me. Over the past couple of weeks, have you noticed yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless more often than usual?\nPatient: There have been some times in the past couple of weeks where I\u2019ve felt a bit down or discouraged, especially when things start piling up. But it\u2019s not all the time, and those feelings tend to come and go. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s been constant or very intense\u2014just that stress can sometimes make my mood dip a little temporarily.\nDoctor: That makes sense, thank you for your honesty. Over the same time period, have you noticed any changes in your interest or enjoyment in things you usually like to do\u2014have you lost interest in activities or felt less pleasure when doing them?\nPatient: Occasionally, I notice that I don\u2019t enjoy certain activities as much, usually when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. It\u2019s not something that happens all the time, though, and I\u2019m still able to find pleasure in things I usually like most of the time. So, there are moments when it\u2019s harder to get into things, but it isn\u2019t a constant issue.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that detail. How have you been sleeping lately\u2014have you had any problems with falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much?\nPatient: Sleep has been a bit off at times lately. There are nights when I have trouble falling asleep or I wake up more often than usual, and occasionally I end up sleeping a bit more than I planned if I\u2019m really tired. Usually, these issues show up more when I\u2019m stressed out, but it\u2019s not an every night problem. Overall, I can manage, though it\u2019s not quite as consistent as I\u2019d like.\nDoctor: Thank you for explaining that. In terms of your appetite or weight, have you noticed any significant changes lately\u2014like eating a lot more or less than usual, or any shifts in your weight that weren\u2019t intentional?\nPatient: I have noticed occasional changes in my appetite, mostly during times when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. Sometimes I eat less without really thinking about it, or other times I might snack more than usual. There have been slight shifts in my weight, but nothing dramatic or constant. It seems to come and go, depending on how things are going overall.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. Lately, have you noticed feeling unusually tired or low on energy, even after getting some rest, or is your energy level about the same as usual?\nPatient: There are some days when I feel more tired or low on energy, particularly if things have been more hectic or stressful. It\u2019s not something I deal with all the time, though\u2014most days my energy level is about the same as usual. So it occasionally crops up, but hasn\u2019t become a constant or major issue.\nDoctor: Thank you for being clear about that. Have you had any trouble with concentrating, staying focused, or making decisions recently\u2014like your mind is more distracted than usual?\nPatient: Yes, I have been noticing more trouble with concentration lately. My mind tends to feel more distracted, especially when there\u2019s a lot going on. Decision-making has also gotten a bit harder at times\u2014it just takes longer for me to sort things out mentally when I\u2019m dealing with stress. It\u2019s been a recurring issue, but I try to work through it as best I can.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds challenging. Could you tell me a bit more about how often these concentration difficulties come up and whether they're affecting important parts of your daily life, like schoolwork or relationships?\nPatient: These concentration difficulties come up fairly often, especially when I\u2019m under more stress. It can make it harder to keep up with schoolwork or slows me down when I\u2019m trying to finish assignments. With relationships, sometimes it affects how well I listen or engage in conversations, but I haven\u2019t noticed it causing any major problems\u2014just that I\u2019m not always as present as I\u2019d like to be. Overall, it\u2019s noticeable, but I\u2019m trying to manage it.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about how this has affected you. In the past couple of weeks, have you found yourself feeling unusually down on yourself, worthless, or struggling with a lot of guilt over things that might not usually bother you?\nPatient: Yes, I have felt down on myself at times lately, and there are moments when I experience some guilt, especially when I\u2019m feeling more stressed. These feelings aren\u2019t constant, but they are noticeable when things get overwhelming. They tend to show up more when I\u2019m under pressure, but they\u2019re not there all the time.\nDoctor: Thank you for letting me know. When these feelings of being down on yourself or experiencing guilt do show up, how intense would you say they are, and do they ever affect your motivation or how you interact with others?\nPatient: At times, those feelings can get fairly intense, particularly when I\u2019m under a lot of pressure. They do sometimes affect my motivation\u2014it\u2019s harder to get started or keep up momentum when I\u2019m really doubting myself. They also make me less engaged or less talkative around other people, but it hasn\u2019t gotten to a level where I\u2019m consistently having major problems with relationships or daily routines.\nDoctor: Thank you for your honesty. I need to ask: in the past couple of weeks, have you had any thoughts that life isn\u2019t worth living, or had thoughts about death or suicide?\nPatient: I have had some occasional thoughts about death or just feeling overwhelmed to the point where it crosses my mind, especially when things are particularly stressful. These thoughts tend to be fleeting\u2014they aren\u2019t constant, and I don\u2019t have any plans or intent to hurt myself. It\u2019s more a reaction to feeling overloaded than anything else, and not something I act on.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open about that\u2014it\u2019s important to talk about. When these thoughts about death or feeling overwhelmed come up, how often does that tend to happen, and is there anything in particular that helps you manage or move past them?\nPatient: Those kinds of thoughts come up from time to time, particularly when I feel really overwhelmed, but they aren\u2019t a constant part of my day. When they do happen, I usually try to distract myself with something else\u2014like going for a walk, listening to music, or sometimes talking with someone I trust. Those things help me get past it and keep things in perspective.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing how you handle these moments. Outside of those coping strategies you mentioned, is there anything else in your daily life\u2014like hobbies, support from friends or family, or routines\u2014that you feel really helps support your mood or well-being?\nPatient: Yes, having some structure to my routine definitely helps\u2014like sticking to a schedule with classes and daily responsibilities. Spending time with family or friends, even if it\u2019s just for a bit, is also supportive for me. Also, keeping up with a few hobbies, like reading or listening to music, makes a difference in staying balanced. Overall, having these general supports around helps me manage things a bit better.\nDoctor: Thanks for describing your supports and daily routine. Over the past couple of weeks, have you noticed feeling unusually restless, agitated, or maybe the opposite\u2014moving or speaking more slowly than usual?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed feeling unusually restless or slowed down. Nothing out of the ordinary that way.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
