It feels really overwhelming, and sometimes I notice I have trouble focusing or following through with things at work or even around the house. It's not like one exact thing is wrong, it just kind of heaps up and makes me feel like I'm always falling behind or forgetting things, which just pulls me down more the longer it goes on."

The focus issues are just as frequent; most days I catch myself spacing out or forgetting what I was just working on, and it's really frustrating. I do get an occasional day that feels a little easier, but overall it's a pretty persistent struggle that's really getting to me."

At work, the constant exhaustion and lack of focus mean I end up making silly mistakes or not finishing things as well as I should\u2014it\u2019s embarrassing to realize later that I forgot something important. At home it\u2019s a similar story: sometimes I lose the thread on basic tasks or chores, or I just don\u2019t have it in me to keep up, so things pile up fast. The expectation to stay on top of everything just feels huge, and I get so frustrated with myself because I'm not meeting what I know should be a normal level.

      "role": "user",
      "content": "Not really, no\u2014I wouldn't say feeling down or hopeless is my main problem most days. It's more that the constant fatigue and struggle to concentrate just wear me out and leave me pretty frustrated, sometimes discouraged, but I don't usually feel sad or have that kind of lasting gloomy mood. It's really the exhaustion and feeling overwhelmed by not keeping up that gets to me the most."

Honestly, the exhaustion kind of kills my motivation to do much, so I might skip stuff even if I know it\u2019s something I typically like. That being said, I can still enjoy things now and then\u2014it just feels like it takes a lot more effort to get myself going, and the fatigue is what holds me back more than anything else."

      "content": "It\u2019s more of a general pattern for me\u2014most things just feel harder to start or stick with because the fatigue makes everything seem like too much effort sometimes. I end up skipping out on activities I used to be up for, but it\u2019s not just one type of thing; it kind of spreads across hobbies, social stuff, even just basic things at home.

I also find myself weighing decisions longer than I should, even for simple things, and I get really frustrated with myself because I know it didn't use to be like this.
