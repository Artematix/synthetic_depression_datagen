Pretty much the same as usual.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, Marcus. With all the changes around work lately, what\u2019s been helping you get through the day or cope with any of the uncertainty?\nPatient: Mostly just going through the day as usual.

Over the past couple of weeks, have you found yourself losing interest or enjoyment in things you usually like doing, even if just a little?\nPatient: No, not really.

Is there anything specific that helps you relax or take your mind off stress, especially with the uncertainties around work lately?\nPatient: Not really. I just try to stick to what I usually do. Nothing special helps me relax or anything like that.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Marcus. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently, such as eating much more or less than usual, even if the change seems small?\nPatient: No, not that I\u2019ve noticed. Seems about the same as usual.\nDoctor: Have you had any trouble with your sleep recently, like struggling to fall asleep, waking up too often during the night, or sleeping much more or less than you used to?\nPatient: No problems with sleep. It\u2019s been fine.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know. Have you been feeling unusually tired or low on energy during the day, even after getting enough sleep?\nPatient: Not really. My energy feels about the same as it normally does.\nDoctor: Alright, that\u2019s good to hear. How about your ability to focus or make decisions lately\u2014have you noticed any trouble concentrating on things or feeling more indecisive than you usually are?\nPatient: No, nothing unusual. I haven\u2019t noticed any problems with that.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know.

Your task now is to decide how the doctor should continue or conclude the interview.\n\nYour role:\nYou do not write the doctor's spoken answer.\nYou write short guidance that will be passed to a separate doctor language model.\n\nYour guidance must stay consistent with:\n- Doctor persona\n- Doctor microstyle (warmth, directness, pacing)\n- Patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background and the recent dialogue\n\nCore principle:\nNow that DSM areas are covered, focus on patient comfort and closure. The patient should leave feeling heard, understood, and cared for. Use FOLLOW_UP or RAPPORT as needed to address anything left unsaid, ease any remaining tension, or simply acknowledge the patient as a person before ending.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or help the patient feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, or ease tension\n- \"END\": guide the doctor to begin closing and wrapping up the visit in a warm, supportive way\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- The last few turns of dialogue, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"END\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"response_instruction\": \"one or two sentences describing what the doctor model should do and ask, written as instructions\"\n}\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP when the last reply raises questions you still need to understand, or when the patient seems to want more space to share.\n- response_instruction should describe a brief acknowledgement of what the patient said and one open question that invites them to say more.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT when the patient shared something personal or emotional that deserves a human response, or when a bit more connection would help them feel cared for.\n- This is especially valuable before ending\u2014patients should feel understood as people, not just as symptom checklists.\n- response_instruction should describe a short validating comment and one open question that fits the doctor's persona and microstyle.\n\nEND:\n- Use END when DSM areas are covered and the conversation feels ready to move toward a natural closing.\n- The patient should feel acknowledged and cared for as the visit ends.\n- response_instruction should describe how the doctor begins to wrap up: warmly acknowledge what has been shared, offer a concise summary or next-step framing if appropriate, and invite the patient to raise anything else they want to mention before ending.\n\nresponse_instruction must always be written as instructions to the doctor model about what to do and how to ask, not as the doctor's actual spoken text.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m alright. Nothing too out of the ordinary, I guess. Just here for the check-up.\nDoctor: Thanks for coming in today, Marcus. Can you tell me a little about what your days have been like recently, especially with everything that\u2019s been going on for you?\nPatient: It\u2019s pretty much the same as usual. My days are mostly normal\u2014nothing major to mention.\nDoctor: I hear you\u2014sometimes things can feel routine on the surface. Are there any particular parts of your day or sources of stress lately that have stood out, either in a positive or challenging way?\nPatient: Not really. Nothing jumps out. Overall, things are pretty routine\u2014nothing stands out good or bad.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that with me. Can I ask\u2014over the past couple of weeks, have you noticed yourself feeling down, sad, or hopeless more often than usual?\nPatient: Not really. Haven\u2019t noticed anything like that. Pretty much the same as usual.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, Marcus. With all the changes around work lately, what\u2019s been helping you get through the day or cope with any of the uncertainty?\nPatient: Mostly just going through the day as usual. Nothing special, I guess. Just keeping to my routine.\nDoctor: That makes sense. Over the past couple of weeks, have you found yourself losing interest or enjoyment in things you usually like doing, even if just a little?\nPatient: No, not really. Things feel about the same as usual for me.\nDoctor: I appreciate your openness. Is there anything specific that helps you relax or take your mind off stress, especially with the uncertainties around work lately?\nPatient: Not really. I just try to stick to what I usually do. Nothing special helps me relax or anything like that.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Marcus. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently, such as eating much more or less than usual, even if the change seems small?\nPatient: No, not that I\u2019ve noticed. Seems about the same as usual.\nDoctor: Have you had any trouble with your sleep recently, like struggling to fall asleep, waking up too often during the night, or sleeping much more or less than you used to?\nPatient: No problems with sleep. It\u2019s been fine.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know. Have you been feeling unusually tired or low on energy during the day, even after getting enough sleep?\nPatient: Not really. My energy feels about the same as it normally does.\nDoctor: Alright, that\u2019s good to hear. How about your ability to focus or make decisions lately\u2014have you noticed any trouble concentrating on things or feeling more indecisive than you usually are?\nPatient: No, nothing unusual. I haven\u2019t noticed any problems with that.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know. Have you noticed yourself moving or speaking much more slowly than usual, or, on the other hand, feeling unusually restless or fidgety lately?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed anything different with that. Seems about the same as usual.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open with me, Marcus. In the past couple of weeks, have you found yourself feeling really down on yourself, unusually guilty, or thinking you\u2019re not doing enough, even if those feelings don\u2019t quite match the situation?\nPatient: No, I wouldn\u2019t say so. Nothing like that has stood out to me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. Just to check in\u2014have you had any thoughts lately about not wanting to be here, wishing you were dead, or thinking about hurting yourself in any way?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
