Nothing out of the ordinary.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear you\u2019re keeping busy. Can you tell me a bit about what a typical day looks like for you right now?\nPatient: Most days I get up, go to work, take care of things there, and handle what needs to be done at home after. I pretty much just go through my routine and keep up with what\u2019s expected.\nDoctor: Sounds like you have a pretty full routine. Out of curiosity, do you have anything in your day\u2014big or small\u2014that helps you manage stress or take your mind off things when life gets busy?\nPatient: Mostly I rely on keeping to my schedule and getting things ticked off. There's not much downtime, but following the routine helps me manage.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it makes sense that having a routine helps you cope. Over the past couple of weeks, have you noticed feeling down, depressed, or hopeless at all, even if just some days?\nPatient: Not really. I just focus on keeping busy and sticking to what needs to get done.\nDoctor: Totally hear you on staying busy. In the last couple of weeks, have you found yourself losing interest or enjoyment in things that you usually like to do\u2014even little stuff you normally don\u2019t think twice about?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real change. I just keep up with my usual routine.\nDoctor: Got it. Let\u2019s talk about sleep for a second\u2014have you had any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much lately?\nPatient: Some nights are a little off, but it hasn\u2019t really gotten in the way.

And when it does happen, is it more trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up too early?\nPatient: It\u2019s occasional. Usually it\u2019s trouble falling asleep, but it doesn\u2019t interfere much.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. Have you noticed any big changes in your appetite or weight lately, like eating much more or less than usual or gaining or losing weight without trying?\nPatient: There have been some small changes in appetite or weight, but nothing major. I\u2019m still getting things done as usual.\nDoctor: Makes sense. Over the past couple of weeks, have you felt unusually tired or low on energy, even on days when you\u2019ve gotten enough sleep?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit tired, but it hasn\u2019t stopped me from handling my responsibilities.\nDoctor: When you say \u201csometimes,\u201d do you find yourself feeling more tired than usual on a regular basis, or is it pretty rare? And is there anything that tends to make the tiredness better or worse for you?\nPatient: It\u2019s not that often. It comes up here and there, but it doesn\u2019t get in the way of my routine.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying. Over the past couple of weeks, have you noticed feeling physically slowed down, like moving or thinking more slowly, or on the flip side, feeling unusually restless or fidgety?\nPatient: Not really. I haven\u2019t noticed much change in that area.\nDoctor: Understood. In the last couple of weeks, have you found yourself feeling unusually down on yourself, worthless, or struggling with guilt more than usual?\nPatient: I can be a bit hard on myself sometimes, but it hasn\u2019t been anything out of the ordinary. I\u2019m still on top of things.\nDoctor: Got it. Lately, have you had any trouble focusing on things, making decisions, or keeping your mind on what needs to get done\u2014maybe more than you typically would?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really had any problems with that. I\u2019m still able to do what I need to.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know.
