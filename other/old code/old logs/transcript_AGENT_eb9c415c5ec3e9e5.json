No rush on this\u2014sometimes it takes a bit of thinking, and it\u2019s perfectly fine if nothing clear comes to mind right now."

This stuff can be so hard to sort through, especially when things in life are shifting or up in the air. I just want to say, the courage it takes to show up and talk about what you\u2019re feeling\u2014especially when it\u2019s not straightforward\u2014isn\u2019t small.

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Hearing you talk about things feeling heavier\u2014it makes me wonder about your energy. Have you noticed feeling more tired, worn out, or just lower on energy than you\u2019re used to these days? Sometimes that kind of heaviness shows up in our bodies, too."

It means a lot that you\u2019re willing to talk about it, even though that isn\u2019t easy. Sitting with this sort of change can be exhausting on its own. If it feels okay, I\u2019d be interested to hear about anything\u2014big or small\u2014that helps you get through on the harder days, but there\u2019s no rush to answer."

Something else that\u2019s really common when life feels heavy or stress hangs around: folks can find it harder to concentrate or make decisions, even small ones.

Sometimes, when people are feeling weighed down, thoughts about death or not wanting to be alive can come up. This is a safe space to talk about anything like that, if it\u2019s been on your mind, but only if you feel comfortable. Have you noticed any thoughts like that lately?"

If you\u2019d like, we can talk about something that feels lighter, or just pause for a bit. I\u2019d also like to check in\u2014how are you feeling about our conversation today?
