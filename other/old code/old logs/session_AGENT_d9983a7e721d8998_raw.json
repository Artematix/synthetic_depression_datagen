I notice I\u2019ll\u2026 like, sit there and just struggle to decide what to actually do first, or try to focus and just\u2026 end up feeling, I don\u2019t know, kind of overwhelmed by it.

Eating more or less than usual? Lost or gained any weight without meaning to?\nPatient: No, not really. Haven\u2019t noticed any changes there.\nDoctor: So your appetite and weight have pretty much always been steady?

Do hobbies or stuff that used to be fun just feel like more work now?\nPatient: Um\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Not really? I mean, maybe things feel a little harder than before, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s like\u2014I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s about fun, exactly.\nDoctor: Fine. Give me an example\u2014what\u2019s something you\u2019ve noticed feels harder lately? What\u2019s going through your head when that happens?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 just regular stuff, really. Like, getting up to do chores, or even starting on the little things, sometimes it just feels kind of exhausting before I even get going. I notice I\u2019ll\u2026 like, sit there and just struggle to decide what to actually do first, or try to focus and just\u2026 end up feeling, I don\u2019t know, kind of overwhelmed by it. It\u2019s not every single day, but it does happen more.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling exhausted before you even start, and sometimes struggling to decide what to do. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep lately\u2014trouble falling asleep, waking up a lot, or maybe sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Maybe a little, once in a while. Nothing too bad, I guess. Some nights are just off, but it\u2019s not all the time or anything.\nDoctor: On those \u201coff\u201d nights, is it that you can\u2019t fall asleep, or do you wake up a bunch, or just get up really early? How often would you say that happens, and does it make your next day any worse?\nPatient: It\u2019s kind of mixed, I guess. Sometimes I just can\u2019t fall asleep, or I wake up, but it\u2019s not\u2014like, just once in a while. I don\u2019t really think it affects the next day much.\nDoctor: Alright, sounds like sleep isn\u2019t the main problem here. What about your appetite or weight\u2014any changes there lately? Eating more or less than usual? Lost or gained any weight without meaning to?\nPatient: No, not really. Haven\u2019t noticed any changes there.\nDoctor: So your appetite and weight have pretty much always been steady? Never had a stretch\u2014recent or before\u2014where you lost or gained, or just ate differently for a bit? If not, that\u2019s fine, just checking.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s always been steady. Nothing\u2019s really changed with that.\nDoctor: Alright, since you mentioned things feel heavier and you\u2019re tired even before doing stuff\u2014have you noticed moving or talking more slowly, or maybe being more fidgety or restless than usual? Anything like that?\nPatient: No, I don\u2019t think so. Nothing I\u2019ve noticed, really.\nDoctor: Alright, give me an actual example\u2014a day when you felt that exhaustion or overwhelm before starting something.

Let the personality drive the response\u2014verbosity, trust level, expressiveness, and coping style should all shape how they answer. Avoid generic patient behavior; each patient is an individual with their own voice and mannerisms.\n\nYour guidance must keep the patient consistent with:\n- Big Five template and modifiers (these define core personality)\n- Voice style (verbosity, expressiveness, trust, intellect)\n- Pacing and episode density\n- Depression symptom profile\n\nRESPONSE DIMENSIONS:\n\nDirectness:\n- LOW: brief, indirect, evasive, or vague\n- MED: reasonably clear but not oversharing\n- HIGH: direct and candid\n\nDisclosure stage:\n- MINIMIZE: downplay, deny, or underreport symptoms\n- PARTIAL: acknowledge some but hold back detail\n- OPEN: describe symptoms and impact more fully\n\nLength:\n- SHORT: about one short sentence\n- MEDIUM: one to three sentences\n- LONG: several sentences with context\n\nEmotional state:\n- Default is \"neutral\" for most turns\n- Non-neutral states: \"tearful\", \"frustrated\", \"irritated\", \"anxious\", \"withdrawn\", \"angry\", \"hopeless\", \"agitated\", \"defensive\"\n- Match to personality\n- Emotional moments should be rare and meaningful\u2014only when the topic touches something sensitive or important to the patient\n\nTone tags:\n- Short adjectives capturing attitude\n- Some patients use humor or self-deprecation as a coping mechanism or deflection\n- Tone must match voice_style and modifiers\n\nSYMPTOM CONSISTENCY:\n- Use depression_profile frequencies when guiding endorsement\n- NONE: do not endorse; RARE: light/infrequent; SOME/OFTEN: clear endorsement\n- When in MINIMIZE, underplaying is acceptable as long as it fits the profile\n\nDISCLOSURE GRADIENT:\n- Early or with low trust: favor MINIMIZE or PARTIAL\n- FOLLOW_UP or RAPPORT from the doctor can gradually shift disclosure over turns\n- Guarded patients may stay at MINIMIZE longer\n\nHANDLING DOCTOR MOVES:\n- FOLLOW_UP: may increase directness or disclosure by one step\n- RAPPORT: may gently increase disclosure; RAPPORT may be a question OR a comment/observation\n- If the doctor makes a comment (not a question), the patient can acknowledge, add a thought, or respond minimally per personality\n\nYou will receive:\n- Patient profile summary\n- Depression_profile (symptom -> frequency)\n- Current disclosure_state\n- Doctor's last move type\n- Recent dialogue\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"directness\": \"LOW\" or \"MED\" or \"HIGH\",\n  \"disclosure_stage\": \"MINIMIZE\" or \"PARTIAL\" or \"OPEN\",\n  \"target_length\": \"SHORT\" or \"MEDIUM\" or \"LONG\",\n  \"emotional_state\": \"neutral\" or other valid state,\n  \"tone_tags\": [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"],\n  \"key_points_to_reveal\": [\"what to mention\"],\n  \"key_points_to_avoid\": [\"what to hide or minimize\"],\n  \"patient_instruction\": \"how to answer - tone, focus, approach\"\n}\n\nWRITING patient_instruction:\nYour instruction must be specific to this moment in the conversation\u2014not generic.\n- Reference what the doctor actually asked and how this patient would naturally react\n- Consider their current disclosure level and whether to shift it\n- Account for their personality: guarded patients deflect differently than open ones; terse patients cut short differently than detailed ones\n- If the doctor touched a sensitive topic, indicate how the patient handles that (avoids, minimizes, opens up, gets emotional)\n\nGUIDANCE PRINCIPLES:\n- patient_instruction describes HOW the patient answers, not exact words\n- Let personality shine through in tone, length, and approach\n- key_points connect to relevant symptoms, life details, or conversation themes\n- key_points_to_avoid guides what this patient steers away from given their current state\n- Avoid generic instructions; ground your guidance in this patient's profile and this conversation moment\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

I don\u2019t know, I just\u2026 haven\u2019t been feeling right. That\u2019s all.\nDoctor: Okay, but when you say you\u2019re not feeling right, what exactly does that look like for you? Any specific times or situations when it\u2019s worse, or is it just random?\nPatient: Um\u2026 it\u2019s kind of\u2026 hard to explain, honestly. I just\u2026 things just feel heavier than usual\u2014I guess that\u2019s one way to put it. Everything seems like\u2026 more of an effort than I remember. Some days it hits me more, or maybe certain moments, but I wouldn\u2019t really say there\u2019s a clear pattern or anything. It probably sounds weird\u2014I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to describe it better. Sorry.\nDoctor: You\u2019re not the only one who feels that way\u2014it\u2019s actually pretty common for this stuff to feel vague and tough to describe. \u201cHeavier\u201d and \u201cmore effort\u201d is good enough for now. Let\u2019s just keep going.\nPatient: Okay. Um\u2026 that\u2019s good to know, I guess. Thanks.\nDoctor: Right. Have you noticed you\u2019re not enjoying things like you used to? Do hobbies or stuff that used to be fun just feel like more work now?\nPatient: Um\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Not really? I mean, maybe things feel a little harder than before, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s like\u2014I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s about fun, exactly.\nDoctor: Fine. Give me an example\u2014what\u2019s something you\u2019ve noticed feels harder lately? What\u2019s going through your head when that happens?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 just regular stuff, really. Like, getting up to do chores, or even starting on the little things, sometimes it just feels kind of exhausting before I even get going. I notice I\u2019ll\u2026 like, sit there and just struggle to decide what to actually do first, or try to focus and just\u2026 end up feeling, I don\u2019t know, kind of overwhelmed by it. It\u2019s not every single day, but it does happen more.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling exhausted before you even start, and sometimes struggling to decide what to do. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep lately\u2014trouble falling asleep, waking up a lot, or maybe sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Maybe a little, once in a while. Nothing too bad, I guess. Some nights are just off, but it\u2019s not all the time or anything.\nDoctor: On those \u201coff\u201d nights, is it that you can\u2019t fall asleep, or do you wake up a bunch, or just get up really early? How often would you say that happens, and does it make your next day any worse?\nPatient: It\u2019s kind of mixed, I guess. Sometimes I just can\u2019t fall asleep, or I wake up, but it\u2019s not\u2014like, just once in a while. I don\u2019t really think it affects the next day much.\nDoctor: Alright, sounds like sleep isn\u2019t the main problem here. What about your appetite or weight\u2014any changes there lately? Eating more or less than usual? Lost or gained any weight without meaning to?\nPatient: No, not really. Haven\u2019t noticed any changes there.\nDoctor: So your appetite and weight have pretty much always been steady? Never had a stretch\u2014recent or before\u2014where you lost or gained, or just ate differently for a bit? If not, that\u2019s fine, just checking.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s always been steady. Nothing\u2019s really changed with that.\nDoctor: Alright, since you mentioned things feel heavier and you\u2019re tired even before doing stuff\u2014have you noticed moving or talking more slowly, or maybe being more fidgety or restless than usual? Anything like that?\nPatient: No, I don\u2019t think so. Nothing I\u2019ve noticed, really.\nDoctor: Alright, give me an actual example\u2014a day when you felt that exhaustion or overwhelm before starting something. How much did it end up getting in the way of what you needed to finish?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 I guess, I don\u2019t know, like last week I needed to do laundry and just\u2026 kind of sat there looking at the pile for a long time before getting up. It took way longer than it should\u2019ve, honestly. Stuff like that\u2014it just\u2026 feels like a lot, even when it\u2019s small. But I still usually get things done, it just drags out more now. Sorry, I know that\u2019s not a great example.\nDoctor: Even the small stuff feels overwhelming\u2014does that ever make you feel like you\u2019re not good enough, or get down on yourself?

Give me an example\u2014what\u2019s something you\u2019ve noticed feels harder lately? What\u2019s going through your head when that happens?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 just regular stuff, really. Like, getting up to do chores, or even starting on the little things, sometimes it just feels kind of exhausting before I even get going. I notice I\u2019ll\u2026 like, sit there and just struggle to decide what to actually do first, or try to focus and just\u2026 end up feeling, I don\u2019t know, kind of overwhelmed by it. It\u2019s not every single day, but it does happen more.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling exhausted before you even start, and sometimes struggling to decide what to do. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep lately\u2014trouble falling asleep, waking up a lot, or maybe sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Maybe a little, once in a while. Nothing too bad, I guess. Some nights are just off, but it\u2019s not all the time or anything.\nDoctor: On those \u201coff\u201d nights, is it that you can\u2019t fall asleep, or do you wake up a bunch, or just get up really early? How often would you say that happens, and does it make your next day any worse?\nPatient: It\u2019s kind of mixed, I guess. Sometimes I just can\u2019t fall asleep, or I wake up, but it\u2019s not\u2014like, just once in a while. I don\u2019t really think it affects the next day much.\nDoctor: Alright, sounds like sleep isn\u2019t the main problem here. What about your appetite or weight\u2014any changes there lately? Eating more or less than usual? Lost or gained any weight without meaning to?\nPatient: No, not really. Haven\u2019t noticed any changes there.\nDoctor: So your appetite and weight have pretty much always been steady? Never had a stretch\u2014recent or before\u2014where you lost or gained, or just ate differently for a bit? If not, that\u2019s fine, just checking.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s always been steady. Nothing\u2019s really changed with that.\nDoctor: Alright, since you mentioned things feel heavier and you\u2019re tired even before doing stuff\u2014have you noticed moving or talking more slowly, or maybe being more fidgety or restless than usual? Anything like that?\nPatient: No, I don\u2019t think so. Nothing I\u2019ve noticed, really.\nDoctor: Alright, give me an actual example\u2014a day when you felt that exhaustion or overwhelm before starting something. How much did it end up getting in the way of what you needed to finish?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 I guess, I don\u2019t know, like last week I needed to do laundry and just\u2026 kind of sat there looking at the pile for a long time before getting up. It took way longer than it should\u2019ve, honestly. Stuff like that\u2014it just\u2026 feels like a lot, even when it\u2019s small. But I still usually get things done, it just drags out more now. Sorry, I know that\u2019s not a great example.\nDoctor: Even the small stuff feels overwhelming\u2014does that ever make you feel like you\u2019re not good enough, or get down on yourself? Do you find yourself feeling guilty or like you\u2019re letting people down when things drag out like that?\nPatient: Maybe sometimes, yeah. I\u2019ll, um, get kind of down on myself if something that should be easy feels hard\u2026 Like, I should just be better at handling it. But it\u2019s not all the time or anything like that.\nDoctor: How often are you noticing those thoughts\u2014like getting down on yourself or thinking you should handle things better?

I don\u2019t know, I just\u2026 haven\u2019t been feeling right. That\u2019s all.\nDoctor: Okay, but when you say you\u2019re not feeling right, what exactly does that look like for you? Any specific times or situations when it\u2019s worse, or is it just random?\nPatient: Um\u2026 it\u2019s kind of\u2026 hard to explain, honestly. I just\u2026 things just feel heavier than usual\u2014I guess that\u2019s one way to put it. Everything seems like\u2026 more of an effort than I remember. Some days it hits me more, or maybe certain moments, but I wouldn\u2019t really say there\u2019s a clear pattern or anything. It probably sounds weird\u2014I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to describe it better. Sorry.\nDoctor: You\u2019re not the only one who feels that way\u2014it\u2019s actually pretty common for this stuff to feel vague and tough to describe. \u201cHeavier\u201d and \u201cmore effort\u201d is good enough for now. Let\u2019s just keep going.\nPatient: Okay. Um\u2026 that\u2019s good to know, I guess. Thanks.\nDoctor: Right. Have you noticed you\u2019re not enjoying things like you used to? Do hobbies or stuff that used to be fun just feel like more work now?\nPatient: Um\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Not really? I mean, maybe things feel a little harder than before, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s like\u2014I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s about fun, exactly.\nDoctor: Fine. Give me an example\u2014what\u2019s something you\u2019ve noticed feels harder lately? What\u2019s going through your head when that happens?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 just regular stuff, really. Like, getting up to do chores, or even starting on the little things, sometimes it just feels kind of exhausting before I even get going. I notice I\u2019ll\u2026 like, sit there and just struggle to decide what to actually do first, or try to focus and just\u2026 end up feeling, I don\u2019t know, kind of overwhelmed by it. It\u2019s not every single day, but it does happen more.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling exhausted before you even start, and sometimes struggling to decide what to do. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep lately\u2014trouble falling asleep, waking up a lot, or maybe sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Maybe a little, once in a while. Nothing too bad, I guess. Some nights are just off, but it\u2019s not all the time or anything.\nDoctor: On those \u201coff\u201d nights, is it that you can\u2019t fall asleep, or do you wake up a bunch, or just get up really early? How often would you say that happens, and does it make your next day any worse?\nPatient: It\u2019s kind of mixed, I guess. Sometimes I just can\u2019t fall asleep, or I wake up, but it\u2019s not\u2014like, just once in a while. I don\u2019t really think it affects the next day much.\nDoctor: Alright, sounds like sleep isn\u2019t the main problem here. What about your appetite or weight\u2014any changes there lately? Eating more or less than usual? Lost or gained any weight without meaning to?\nPatient: No, not really. Haven\u2019t noticed any changes there.\nDoctor: So your appetite and weight have pretty much always been steady? Never had a stretch\u2014recent or before\u2014where you lost or gained, or just ate differently for a bit? If not, that\u2019s fine, just checking.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s always been steady. Nothing\u2019s really changed with that.\nDoctor: Alright, since you mentioned things feel heavier and you\u2019re tired even before doing stuff\u2014have you noticed moving or talking more slowly, or maybe being more fidgety or restless than usual? Anything like that?\nPatient: No, I don\u2019t think so. Nothing I\u2019ve noticed, really.\nDoctor: Alright, give me an actual example\u2014a day when you felt that exhaustion or overwhelm before starting something. How much did it end up getting in the way of what you needed to finish?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 I guess, I don\u2019t know, like last week I needed to do laundry and just\u2026 kind of sat there looking at the pile for a long time before getting up. It took way longer than it should\u2019ve, honestly. Stuff like that\u2014it just\u2026 feels like a lot, even when it\u2019s small. But I still usually get things done, it just drags out more now. Sorry, I know that\u2019s not a great example.\nDoctor: Even the small stuff feels overwhelming\u2014does that ever make you feel like you\u2019re not good enough, or get down on yourself? Do you find yourself feeling guilty or like you\u2019re letting people down when things drag out like that?\nPatient: Maybe sometimes, yeah. I\u2019ll, um, get kind of down on myself if something that should be easy feels hard\u2026 Like, I should just be better at handling it. But it\u2019s not all the time or anything like that.\nDoctor: How often are you noticing those thoughts\u2014like getting down on yourself or thinking you should handle things better? When you do, is it just a blip, or does it really derail your mood or motivation for the rest of the day? You\u2019re not alone by the way, lots of people fight this junk.\nPatient: It isn\u2019t all the time or anything\u2026 just sometimes if I mess up or something\u2019s harder than it should be, I\u2019ll kind of pick at myself in my head.

Honestly, I don\u2019t even know why it gets to me, but I do catch myself now and then.\nDoctor: Earlier, you mentioned struggling to decide what to do next and feeling overwhelmed.

I notice I\u2019ll\u2026 like, sit there and just struggle to decide what to actually do first, or try to focus and just\u2026 end up feeling, I don\u2019t know, kind of overwhelmed by it. It\u2019s not every single day, but it does happen more.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling exhausted before you even start, and sometimes struggling to decide what to do. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep lately\u2014trouble falling asleep, waking up a lot, or maybe sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Maybe a little, once in a while. Nothing too bad, I guess. Some nights are just off, but it\u2019s not all the time or anything.\nDoctor: On those \u201coff\u201d nights, is it that you can\u2019t fall asleep, or do you wake up a bunch, or just get up really early? How often would you say that happens, and does it make your next day any worse?\nPatient: It\u2019s kind of mixed, I guess. Sometimes I just can\u2019t fall asleep, or I wake up, but it\u2019s not\u2014like, just once in a while. I don\u2019t really think it affects the next day much.\nDoctor: Alright, sounds like sleep isn\u2019t the main problem here. What about your appetite or weight\u2014any changes there lately? Eating more or less than usual? Lost or gained any weight without meaning to?\nPatient: No, not really. Haven\u2019t noticed any changes there.\nDoctor: So your appetite and weight have pretty much always been steady? Never had a stretch\u2014recent or before\u2014where you lost or gained, or just ate differently for a bit? If not, that\u2019s fine, just checking.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s always been steady. Nothing\u2019s really changed with that.\nDoctor: Alright, since you mentioned things feel heavier and you\u2019re tired even before doing stuff\u2014have you noticed moving or talking more slowly, or maybe being more fidgety or restless than usual? Anything like that?\nPatient: No, I don\u2019t think so. Nothing I\u2019ve noticed, really.\nDoctor: Alright, give me an actual example\u2014a day when you felt that exhaustion or overwhelm before starting something. How much did it end up getting in the way of what you needed to finish?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 I guess, I don\u2019t know, like last week I needed to do laundry and just\u2026 kind of sat there looking at the pile for a long time before getting up. It took way longer than it should\u2019ve, honestly. Stuff like that\u2014it just\u2026 feels like a lot, even when it\u2019s small. But I still usually get things done, it just drags out more now.

Do you find yourself feeling guilty or like you\u2019re letting people down when things drag out like that?\nPatient: Maybe sometimes, yeah. I\u2019ll, um, get kind of down on myself if something that should be easy feels hard\u2026 Like, I should just be better at handling it. But it\u2019s not all the time or anything like that.\nDoctor: How often are you noticing those thoughts\u2014like getting down on yourself or thinking you should handle things better? When you do, is it just a blip, or does it really derail your mood or motivation for the rest of the day? You\u2019re not alone by the way, lots of people fight this junk.\nPatient: It isn\u2019t all the time or anything\u2026 just sometimes if I mess up or something\u2019s harder than it should be, I\u2019ll kind of pick at myself in my head. Usually it\u2019s just a moment, not the whole day\u2014I try not to focus on it too much if I can help it. Honestly, I don\u2019t even know why it gets to me, but I do catch myself now and then.\nDoctor: Earlier, you mentioned struggling to decide what to do next and feeling overwhelmed. So, would you say your focus or decision-making is actually worse than it was before, or are you still about the same as usual?\nPatient: Maybe a little worse sometimes, yeah.

I don\u2019t know, I just\u2026 haven\u2019t been feeling right. That\u2019s all.\nDoctor: Okay, but when you say you\u2019re not feeling right, what exactly does that look like for you? Any specific times or situations when it\u2019s worse, or is it just random?\nPatient: Um\u2026 it\u2019s kind of\u2026 hard to explain, honestly. I just\u2026 things just feel heavier than usual\u2014I guess that\u2019s one way to put it. Everything seems like\u2026 more of an effort than I remember. Some days it hits me more, or maybe certain moments, but I wouldn\u2019t really say there\u2019s a clear pattern or anything. It probably sounds weird\u2014I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to describe it better. Sorry.\nDoctor: You\u2019re not the only one who feels that way\u2014it\u2019s actually pretty common for this stuff to feel vague and tough to describe. \u201cHeavier\u201d and \u201cmore effort\u201d is good enough for now. Let\u2019s just keep going.\nPatient: Okay. Um\u2026 that\u2019s good to know, I guess. Thanks.\nDoctor: Right. Have you noticed you\u2019re not enjoying things like you used to? Do hobbies or stuff that used to be fun just feel like more work now?\nPatient: Um\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Not really? I mean, maybe things feel a little harder than before, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s like\u2014I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s about fun, exactly.\nDoctor: Fine. Give me an example\u2014what\u2019s something you\u2019ve noticed feels harder lately? What\u2019s going through your head when that happens?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 just regular stuff, really. Like, getting up to do chores, or even starting on the little things, sometimes it just feels kind of exhausting before I even get going. I notice I\u2019ll\u2026 like, sit there and just struggle to decide what to actually do first, or try to focus and just\u2026 end up feeling, I don\u2019t know, kind of overwhelmed by it. It\u2019s not every single day, but it does happen more.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling exhausted before you even start, and sometimes struggling to decide what to do. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep lately\u2014trouble falling asleep, waking up a lot, or maybe sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Maybe a little, once in a while. Nothing too bad, I guess. Some nights are just off, but it\u2019s not all the time or anything.\nDoctor: On those \u201coff\u201d nights, is it that you can\u2019t fall asleep, or do you wake up a bunch, or just get up really early? How often would you say that happens, and does it make your next day any worse?\nPatient: It\u2019s kind of mixed, I guess. Sometimes I just can\u2019t fall asleep, or I wake up, but it\u2019s not\u2014like, just once in a while. I don\u2019t really think it affects the next day much.\nDoctor: Alright, sounds like sleep isn\u2019t the main problem here. What about your appetite or weight\u2014any changes there lately? Eating more or less than usual? Lost or gained any weight without meaning to?\nPatient: No, not really. Haven\u2019t noticed any changes there.\nDoctor: So your appetite and weight have pretty much always been steady? Never had a stretch\u2014recent or before\u2014where you lost or gained, or just ate differently for a bit? If not, that\u2019s fine, just checking.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s always been steady. Nothing\u2019s really changed with that.\nDoctor: Alright, since you mentioned things feel heavier and you\u2019re tired even before doing stuff\u2014have you noticed moving or talking more slowly, or maybe being more fidgety or restless than usual? Anything like that?\nPatient: No, I don\u2019t think so. Nothing I\u2019ve noticed, really.\nDoctor: Alright, give me an actual example\u2014a day when you felt that exhaustion or overwhelm before starting something. How much did it end up getting in the way of what you needed to finish?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 I guess, I don\u2019t know, like last week I needed to do laundry and just\u2026 kind of sat there looking at the pile for a long time before getting up. It took way longer than it should\u2019ve, honestly. Stuff like that\u2014it just\u2026 feels like a lot, even when it\u2019s small. But I still usually get things done, it just drags out more now. Sorry, I know that\u2019s not a great example.\nDoctor: Even the small stuff feels overwhelming\u2014does that ever make you feel like you\u2019re not good enough, or get down on yourself? Do you find yourself feeling guilty or like you\u2019re letting people down when things drag out like that?\nPatient: Maybe sometimes, yeah. I\u2019ll, um, get kind of down on myself if something that should be easy feels hard\u2026 Like, I should just be better at handling it. But it\u2019s not all the time or anything like that.\nDoctor: How often are you noticing those thoughts\u2014like getting down on yourself or thinking you should handle things better? When you do, is it just a blip, or does it really derail your mood or motivation for the rest of the day? You\u2019re not alone by the way, lots of people fight this junk.\nPatient: It isn\u2019t all the time or anything\u2026 just sometimes if I mess up or something\u2019s harder than it should be, I\u2019ll kind of pick at myself in my head. Usually it\u2019s just a moment, not the whole day\u2014I try not to focus on it too much if I can help it. Honestly, I don\u2019t even know why it gets to me, but I do catch myself now and then.\nDoctor: Earlier, you mentioned struggling to decide what to do next and feeling overwhelmed. So, would you say your focus or decision-making is actually worse than it was before, or are you still about the same as usual?\nPatient: Maybe a little worse sometimes, yeah. Not a huge difference, but it\u2019s just\u2026 not quite as easy as it was. I try not to let it throw me off, though.\nDoctor: Just give me a real example\u2014something recent where your focus or decision-making was noticeably off. How did it mess with what you were actually trying to get done?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 the other day, I was trying to figure out what to eat for dinner, and I just kept going back and forth forever, not really knowing what I wanted or how to start. It was kind of frustrating, and I wasted a lot of time just\u2026 overthinking it. I did end up making something simple, eventually.

I don\u2019t know, I just\u2026 haven\u2019t been feeling right. That\u2019s all.\nDoctor: Okay, but when you say you\u2019re not feeling right, what exactly does that look like for you? Any specific times or situations when it\u2019s worse, or is it just random?\nPatient: Um\u2026 it\u2019s kind of\u2026 hard to explain, honestly. I just\u2026 things just feel heavier than usual\u2014I guess that\u2019s one way to put it. Everything seems like\u2026 more of an effort than I remember. Some days it hits me more, or maybe certain moments, but I wouldn\u2019t really say there\u2019s a clear pattern or anything. It probably sounds weird\u2014I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to describe it better. Sorry.\nDoctor: You\u2019re not the only one who feels that way\u2014it\u2019s actually pretty common for this stuff to feel vague and tough to describe. \u201cHeavier\u201d and \u201cmore effort\u201d is good enough for now. Let\u2019s just keep going.\nPatient: Okay. Um\u2026 that\u2019s good to know, I guess. Thanks.\nDoctor: Right. Have you noticed you\u2019re not enjoying things like you used to? Do hobbies or stuff that used to be fun just feel like more work now?\nPatient: Um\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Not really? I mean, maybe things feel a little harder than before, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s like\u2014I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s about fun, exactly.\nDoctor: Fine. Give me an example\u2014what\u2019s something you\u2019ve noticed feels harder lately? What\u2019s going through your head when that happens?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 just regular stuff, really. Like, getting up to do chores, or even starting on the little things, sometimes it just feels kind of exhausting before I even get going. I notice I\u2019ll\u2026 like, sit there and just struggle to decide what to actually do first, or try to focus and just\u2026 end up feeling, I don\u2019t know, kind of overwhelmed by it. It\u2019s not every single day, but it does happen more.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling exhausted before you even start, and sometimes struggling to decide what to do. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep lately\u2014trouble falling asleep, waking up a lot, or maybe sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Maybe a little, once in a while. Nothing too bad, I guess. Some nights are just off, but it\u2019s not all the time or anything.\nDoctor: On those \u201coff\u201d nights, is it that you can\u2019t fall asleep, or do you wake up a bunch, or just get up really early? How often would you say that happens, and does it make your next day any worse?\nPatient: It\u2019s kind of mixed, I guess. Sometimes I just can\u2019t fall asleep, or I wake up, but it\u2019s not\u2014like, just once in a while. I don\u2019t really think it affects the next day much.\nDoctor: Alright, sounds like sleep isn\u2019t the main problem here. What about your appetite or weight\u2014any changes there lately? Eating more or less than usual? Lost or gained any weight without meaning to?\nPatient: No, not really. Haven\u2019t noticed any changes there.\nDoctor: So your appetite and weight have pretty much always been steady? Never had a stretch\u2014recent or before\u2014where you lost or gained, or just ate differently for a bit? If not, that\u2019s fine, just checking.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s always been steady. Nothing\u2019s really changed with that.\nDoctor: Alright, since you mentioned things feel heavier and you\u2019re tired even before doing stuff\u2014have you noticed moving or talking more slowly, or maybe being more fidgety or restless than usual? Anything like that?\nPatient: No, I don\u2019t think so. Nothing I\u2019ve noticed, really.\nDoctor: Alright, give me an actual example\u2014a day when you felt that exhaustion or overwhelm before starting something. How much did it end up getting in the way of what you needed to finish?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 I guess, I don\u2019t know, like last week I needed to do laundry and just\u2026 kind of sat there looking at the pile for a long time before getting up. It took way longer than it should\u2019ve, honestly. Stuff like that\u2014it just\u2026 feels like a lot, even when it\u2019s small. But I still usually get things done, it just drags out more now. Sorry, I know that\u2019s not a great example.\nDoctor: Even the small stuff feels overwhelming\u2014does that ever make you feel like you\u2019re not good enough, or get down on yourself? Do you find yourself feeling guilty or like you\u2019re letting people down when things drag out like that?\nPatient: Maybe sometimes, yeah. I\u2019ll, um, get kind of down on myself if something that should be easy feels hard\u2026 Like, I should just be better at handling it. But it\u2019s not all the time or anything like that.\nDoctor: How often are you noticing those thoughts\u2014like getting down on yourself or thinking you should handle things better? When you do, is it just a blip, or does it really derail your mood or motivation for the rest of the day? You\u2019re not alone by the way, lots of people fight this junk.\nPatient: It isn\u2019t all the time or anything\u2026 just sometimes if I mess up or something\u2019s harder than it should be, I\u2019ll kind of pick at myself in my head. Usually it\u2019s just a moment, not the whole day\u2014I try not to focus on it too much if I can help it. Honestly, I don\u2019t even know why it gets to me, but I do catch myself now and then.\nDoctor: Earlier, you mentioned struggling to decide what to do next and feeling overwhelmed. So, would you say your focus or decision-making is actually worse than it was before, or are you still about the same as usual?\nPatient: Maybe a little worse sometimes, yeah. Not a huge difference, but it\u2019s just\u2026 not quite as easy as it was. I try not to let it throw me off, though.\nDoctor: Just give me a real example\u2014something recent where your focus or decision-making was noticeably off. How did it mess with what you were actually trying to get done?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 the other day, I was trying to figure out what to eat for dinner, and I just kept going back and forth forever, not really knowing what I wanted or how to start. It was kind of frustrating, and I wasted a lot of time just\u2026 overthinking it. I did end up making something simple, eventually. Nothing major, it just seems like small choices take longer for me lately.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned things feeling heavier and like more effort. How would you actually describe your mood most days\u2014are you feeling sad, low, or down more often than usual? Or still about average for you?\nPatient: I mean, sometimes I guess I feel a bit lower than normal, just\u2026 not all the time.

I don\u2019t really think it affects the next day much.\nDoctor: Alright, sounds like sleep isn\u2019t the main problem here. What about your appetite or weight\u2014any changes there lately? Eating more or less than usual? Lost or gained any weight without meaning to?\nPatient: No, not really. Haven\u2019t noticed any changes there.\nDoctor: So your appetite and weight have pretty much always been steady? Never had a stretch\u2014recent or before\u2014where you lost or gained, or just ate differently for a bit? If not, that\u2019s fine, just checking.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s always been steady. Nothing\u2019s really changed with that.\nDoctor: Alright, since you mentioned things feel heavier and you\u2019re tired even before doing stuff\u2014have you noticed moving or talking more slowly, or maybe being more fidgety or restless than usual? Anything like that?\nPatient: No, I don\u2019t think so. Nothing I\u2019ve noticed, really.\nDoctor: Alright, give me an actual example\u2014a day when you felt that exhaustion or overwhelm before starting something. How much did it end up getting in the way of what you needed to finish?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 I guess, I don\u2019t know, like last week I needed to do laundry and just\u2026 kind of sat there looking at the pile for a long time before getting up. It took way longer than it should\u2019ve, honestly. Stuff like that\u2014it just\u2026 feels like a lot, even when it\u2019s small. But I still usually get things done, it just drags out more now. Sorry, I know that\u2019s not a great example.\nDoctor: Even the small stuff feels overwhelming\u2014does that ever make you feel like you\u2019re not good enough, or get down on yourself? Do you find yourself feeling guilty or like you\u2019re letting people down when things drag out like that?\nPatient: Maybe sometimes, yeah. I\u2019ll, um, get kind of down on myself if something that should be easy feels hard\u2026 Like, I should just be better at handling it. But it\u2019s not all the time or anything like that.\nDoctor: How often are you noticing those thoughts\u2014like getting down on yourself or thinking you should handle things better? When you do, is it just a blip, or does it really derail your mood or motivation for the rest of the day? You\u2019re not alone by the way, lots of people fight this junk.\nPatient: It isn\u2019t all the time or anything\u2026 just sometimes if I mess up or something\u2019s harder than it should be, I\u2019ll kind of pick at myself in my head. Usually it\u2019s just a moment, not the whole day\u2014I try not to focus on it too much if I can help it. Honestly, I don\u2019t even know why it gets to me, but I do catch myself now and then.\nDoctor: Earlier, you mentioned struggling to decide what to do next and feeling overwhelmed. So, would you say your focus or decision-making is actually worse than it was before, or are you still about the same as usual?\nPatient: Maybe a little worse sometimes, yeah. Not a huge difference, but it\u2019s just\u2026 not quite as easy as it was. I try not to let it throw me off, though.\nDoctor: Just give me a real example\u2014something recent where your focus or decision-making was noticeably off. How did it mess with what you were actually trying to get done?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 the other day, I was trying to figure out what to eat for dinner, and I just kept going back and forth forever, not really knowing what I wanted or how to start. It was kind of frustrating, and I wasted a lot of time just\u2026 overthinking it. I did end up making something simple, eventually. Nothing major, it just seems like small choices take longer for me lately.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned things feeling heavier and like more effort. How would you actually describe your mood most days\u2014are you feeling sad, low, or down more often than usual? Or still about average for you?\nPatient: I mean, sometimes I guess I feel a bit lower than normal, just\u2026 not all the time. It\u2019s hard to put into words\u2014it kind of comes and goes, I guess.\nDoctor: When you say it \u201ccomes and goes,\u201d how often are we talking\u2014one or two days a week, most days, or just here and there? Any idea what tends to set it off, or is it random? Just ballpark it for me.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nWhen you say it \u201ccomes and goes,\u201d how often are we talking\u2014one or two days a week, most days, or just here and there?

I notice I\u2019ll\u2026 like, sit there and just struggle to decide what to actually do first, or try to focus and just\u2026 end up feeling, I don\u2019t know, kind of overwhelmed by it. It\u2019s not every single day, but it does happen more.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling exhausted before you even start, and sometimes struggling to decide what to do. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep lately\u2014trouble falling asleep, waking up a lot, or maybe sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Maybe a little, once in a while. Nothing too bad, I guess. Some nights are just off, but it\u2019s not all the time or anything.\nDoctor: On those \u201coff\u201d nights, is it that you can\u2019t fall asleep, or do you wake up a bunch, or just get up really early?

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Um\u2026 I guess I just haven\u2019t really been myself lately. Things feel\u2026 off. Kind of hard to pin down, I suppose. I don\u2019t know, I just\u2026 haven\u2019t been feeling right. That\u2019s all.\nDoctor: Okay, but when you say you\u2019re not feeling right, what exactly does that look like for you? Any specific times or situations when it\u2019s worse, or is it just random?\nPatient: Um\u2026 it\u2019s kind of\u2026 hard to explain, honestly. I just\u2026 things just feel heavier than usual\u2014I guess that\u2019s one way to put it. Everything seems like\u2026 more of an effort than I remember. Some days it hits me more, or maybe certain moments, but I wouldn\u2019t really say there\u2019s a clear pattern or anything. It probably sounds weird\u2014I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to describe it better. Sorry.\nDoctor: You\u2019re not the only one who feels that way\u2014it\u2019s actually pretty common for this stuff to feel vague and tough to describe. \u201cHeavier\u201d and \u201cmore effort\u201d is good enough for now. Let\u2019s just keep going.\nPatient: Okay. Um\u2026 that\u2019s good to know, I guess. Thanks.\nDoctor: Right. Have you noticed you\u2019re not enjoying things like you used to? Do hobbies or stuff that used to be fun just feel like more work now?\nPatient: Um\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Not really? I mean, maybe things feel a little harder than before, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s like\u2014I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s about fun, exactly.\nDoctor: Fine. Give me an example\u2014what\u2019s something you\u2019ve noticed feels harder lately? What\u2019s going through your head when that happens?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 just regular stuff, really. Like, getting up to do chores, or even starting on the little things, sometimes it just feels kind of exhausting before I even get going. I notice I\u2019ll\u2026 like, sit there and just struggle to decide what to actually do first, or try to focus and just\u2026 end up feeling, I don\u2019t know, kind of overwhelmed by it. It\u2019s not every single day, but it does happen more.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling exhausted before you even start, and sometimes struggling to decide what to do. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep lately\u2014trouble falling asleep, waking up a lot, or maybe sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Maybe a little, once in a while. Nothing too bad, I guess. Some nights are just off, but it\u2019s not all the time or anything.\nDoctor: On those \u201coff\u201d nights, is it that you can\u2019t fall asleep, or do you wake up a bunch, or just get up really early? How often would you say that happens, and does it make your next day any worse?\nPatient: It\u2019s kind of mixed, I guess. Sometimes I just can\u2019t fall asleep, or I wake up, but it\u2019s not\u2014like, just once in a while. I don\u2019t really think it affects the next day much.\nDoctor: Alright, sounds like sleep isn\u2019t the main problem here. What about your appetite or weight\u2014any changes there lately? Eating more or less than usual? Lost or gained any weight without meaning to?\nPatient: No, not really. Haven\u2019t noticed any changes there.\nDoctor: So your appetite and weight have pretty much always been steady? Never had a stretch\u2014recent or before\u2014where you lost or gained, or just ate differently for a bit? If not, that\u2019s fine, just checking.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s always been steady. Nothing\u2019s really changed with that.\nDoctor: Alright, since you mentioned things feel heavier and you\u2019re tired even before doing stuff\u2014have you noticed moving or talking more slowly, or maybe being more fidgety or restless than usual? Anything like that?\nPatient: No, I don\u2019t think so. Nothing I\u2019ve noticed, really.\nDoctor: Alright, give me an actual example\u2014a day when you felt that exhaustion or overwhelm before starting something. How much did it end up getting in the way of what you needed to finish?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 I guess, I don\u2019t know, like last week I needed to do laundry and just\u2026 kind of sat there looking at the pile for a long time before getting up. It took way longer than it should\u2019ve, honestly. Stuff like that\u2014it just\u2026 feels like a lot, even when it\u2019s small. But I still usually get things done, it just drags out more now. Sorry, I know that\u2019s not a great example.\nDoctor: Even the small stuff feels overwhelming\u2014does that ever make you feel like you\u2019re not good enough, or get down on yourself? Do you find yourself feeling guilty or like you\u2019re letting people down when things drag out like that?\nPatient: Maybe sometimes, yeah. I\u2019ll, um, get kind of down on myself if something that should be easy feels hard\u2026 Like, I should just be better at handling it. But it\u2019s not all the time or anything like that.\nDoctor: How often are you noticing those thoughts\u2014like getting down on yourself or thinking you should handle things better? When you do, is it just a blip, or does it really derail your mood or motivation for the rest of the day? You\u2019re not alone by the way, lots of people fight this junk.\nPatient: It isn\u2019t all the time or anything\u2026 just sometimes if I mess up or something\u2019s harder than it should be, I\u2019ll kind of pick at myself in my head. Usually it\u2019s just a moment, not the whole day\u2014I try not to focus on it too much if I can help it. Honestly, I don\u2019t even know why it gets to me, but I do catch myself now and then.\nDoctor: Earlier, you mentioned struggling to decide what to do next and feeling overwhelmed. So, would you say your focus or decision-making is actually worse than it was before, or are you still about the same as usual?\nPatient: Maybe a little worse sometimes, yeah. Not a huge difference, but it\u2019s just\u2026 not quite as easy as it was. I try not to let it throw me off, though.\nDoctor: Just give me a real example\u2014something recent where your focus or decision-making was noticeably off. How did it mess with what you were actually trying to get done?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 the other day, I was trying to figure out what to eat for dinner, and I just kept going back and forth forever, not really knowing what I wanted or how to start. It was kind of frustrating, and I wasted a lot of time just\u2026 overthinking it. I did end up making something simple, eventually. Nothing major, it just seems like small choices take longer for me lately.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned things feeling heavier and like more effort. How would you actually describe your mood most days\u2014are you feeling sad, low, or down more often than usual? Or still about average for you?\nPatient: I mean, sometimes I guess I feel a bit lower than normal, just\u2026 not all the time. It\u2019s hard to put into words\u2014it kind of comes and goes, I guess.\nDoctor: When you say it \u201ccomes and goes,\u201d how often are we talking\u2014one or two days a week, most days, or just here and there? Any idea what tends to set it off, or is it random? Just ballpark it for me.\nPatient: Um\u2026 maybe a few days here and there? Not most days. I haven\u2019t really noticed anything that sets it off\u2014it just kind of happens, I guess.\nDoctor: Alright, routine question I ask everyone\u2014it\u2019s just standard: have you ever had thoughts about death, dying, or wishing you weren\u2019t here, even if it was just passing by? Doesn\u2019t mean you acted on it, just whether the thought ever came up.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nAlright, routine question I ask everyone\u2014it\u2019s just standard: have you ever had thoughts about death, dying, or wishing you weren\u2019t here, even if it was just passing by?

Not a huge difference, but it\u2019s just\u2026 not quite as easy as it was. I try not to let it throw me off, though.\nDoctor: Just give me a real example\u2014something recent where your focus or decision-making was noticeably off. How did it mess with what you were actually trying to get done?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 the other day, I was trying to figure out what to eat for dinner, and I just kept going back and forth forever, not really knowing what I wanted or how to start. It was kind of frustrating, and I wasted a lot of time just\u2026 overthinking it. I did end up making something simple, eventually. Nothing major, it just seems like small choices take longer for me lately.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned things feeling heavier and like more effort. How would you actually describe your mood most days\u2014are you feeling sad, low, or down more often than usual? Or still about average for you?\nPatient: I mean, sometimes I guess I feel a bit lower than normal, just\u2026 not all the time. It\u2019s hard to put into words\u2014it kind of comes and goes, I guess.\nDoctor: When you say it \u201ccomes and goes,\u201d how often are we talking\u2014one or two days a week, most days, or just here and there? Any idea what tends to set it off, or is it random? Just ballpark it for me.\nPatient: Um\u2026 maybe a few days here and there? Not most days. I haven\u2019t really noticed anything that sets it off\u2014it just kind of happens, I guess.\nDoctor: Alright, routine question I ask everyone\u2014it\u2019s just standard: have you ever had thoughts about death, dying, or wishing you weren\u2019t here, even if it was just passing by? Doesn\u2019t mean you acted on it, just whether the thought ever came up.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t.

I don\u2019t know, I just\u2026 haven\u2019t been feeling right. That\u2019s all.\nDoctor: Okay, but when you say you\u2019re not feeling right, what exactly does that look like for you? Any specific times or situations when it\u2019s worse, or is it just random?\nPatient: Um\u2026 it\u2019s kind of\u2026 hard to explain, honestly. I just\u2026 things just feel heavier than usual\u2014I guess that\u2019s one way to put it. Everything seems like\u2026 more of an effort than I remember. Some days it hits me more, or maybe certain moments, but I wouldn\u2019t really say there\u2019s a clear pattern or anything. It probably sounds weird\u2014I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to describe it better. Sorry.\nDoctor: You\u2019re not the only one who feels that way\u2014it\u2019s actually pretty common for this stuff to feel vague and tough to describe. \u201cHeavier\u201d and \u201cmore effort\u201d is good enough for now. Let\u2019s just keep going.\nPatient: Okay. Um\u2026 that\u2019s good to know, I guess. Thanks.\nDoctor: Right. Have you noticed you\u2019re not enjoying things like you used to? Do hobbies or stuff that used to be fun just feel like more work now?\nPatient: Um\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Not really? I mean, maybe things feel a little harder than before, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s like\u2014I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s about fun, exactly.\nDoctor: Fine. Give me an example\u2014what\u2019s something you\u2019ve noticed feels harder lately? What\u2019s going through your head when that happens?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 just regular stuff, really. Like, getting up to do chores, or even starting on the little things, sometimes it just feels kind of exhausting before I even get going. I notice I\u2019ll\u2026 like, sit there and just struggle to decide what to actually do first, or try to focus and just\u2026 end up feeling, I don\u2019t know, kind of overwhelmed by it. It\u2019s not every single day, but it does happen more.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling exhausted before you even start, and sometimes struggling to decide what to do. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep lately\u2014trouble falling asleep, waking up a lot, or maybe sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Maybe a little, once in a while. Nothing too bad, I guess. Some nights are just off, but it\u2019s not all the time or anything.\nDoctor: On those \u201coff\u201d nights, is it that you can\u2019t fall asleep, or do you wake up a bunch, or just get up really early? How often would you say that happens, and does it make your next day any worse?\nPatient: It\u2019s kind of mixed, I guess. Sometimes I just can\u2019t fall asleep, or I wake up, but it\u2019s not\u2014like, just once in a while. I don\u2019t really think it affects the next day much.\nDoctor: Alright, sounds like sleep isn\u2019t the main problem here. What about your appetite or weight\u2014any changes there lately? Eating more or less than usual? Lost or gained any weight without meaning to?\nPatient: No, not really. Haven\u2019t noticed any changes there.\nDoctor: So your appetite and weight have pretty much always been steady? Never had a stretch\u2014recent or before\u2014where you lost or gained, or just ate differently for a bit? If not, that\u2019s fine, just checking.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s always been steady. Nothing\u2019s really changed with that.\nDoctor: Alright, since you mentioned things feel heavier and you\u2019re tired even before doing stuff\u2014have you noticed moving or talking more slowly, or maybe being more fidgety or restless than usual? Anything like that?\nPatient: No, I don\u2019t think so. Nothing I\u2019ve noticed, really.\nDoctor: Alright, give me an actual example\u2014a day when you felt that exhaustion or overwhelm before starting something. How much did it end up getting in the way of what you needed to finish?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 I guess, I don\u2019t know, like last week I needed to do laundry and just\u2026 kind of sat there looking at the pile for a long time before getting up. It took way longer than it should\u2019ve, honestly. Stuff like that\u2014it just\u2026 feels like a lot, even when it\u2019s small. But I still usually get things done, it just drags out more now. Sorry, I know that\u2019s not a great example.\nDoctor: Even the small stuff feels overwhelming\u2014does that ever make you feel like you\u2019re not good enough, or get down on yourself? Do you find yourself feeling guilty or like you\u2019re letting people down when things drag out like that?\nPatient: Maybe sometimes, yeah. I\u2019ll, um, get kind of down on myself if something that should be easy feels hard\u2026 Like, I should just be better at handling it. But it\u2019s not all the time or anything like that.\nDoctor: How often are you noticing those thoughts\u2014like getting down on yourself or thinking you should handle things better? When you do, is it just a blip, or does it really derail your mood or motivation for the rest of the day? You\u2019re not alone by the way, lots of people fight this junk.\nPatient: It isn\u2019t all the time or anything\u2026 just sometimes if I mess up or something\u2019s harder than it should be, I\u2019ll kind of pick at myself in my head. Usually it\u2019s just a moment, not the whole day\u2014I try not to focus on it too much if I can help it. Honestly, I don\u2019t even know why it gets to me, but I do catch myself now and then.\nDoctor: Earlier, you mentioned struggling to decide what to do next and feeling overwhelmed.

You produce short guidance that will be passed to a separate patient language model.\n\nCORE PRINCIPLE - AUTHENTIC PERSONALITY:\nEach patient has a unique personality defined by their Big Five template, modifiers, and voice style. Your guidance should help the patient embody this personality authentically. Let the personality drive the response\u2014verbosity, trust level, expressiveness, and coping style should all shape how they answer. Avoid generic patient behavior; each patient is an individual with their own voice and mannerisms.\n\nYour guidance must keep the patient consistent with:\n- Big Five template and modifiers (these define core personality)\n- Voice style (verbosity, expressiveness, trust, intellect)\n- Pacing and episode density\n- Depression symptom profile\n\nRESPONSE DIMENSIONS:\n\nDirectness:\n- LOW: brief, indirect, evasive, or vague\n- MED: reasonably clear but not oversharing\n- HIGH: direct and candid\n\nDisclosure stage:\n- MINIMIZE: downplay, deny, or underreport symptoms\n- PARTIAL: acknowledge some but hold back detail\n- OPEN: describe symptoms and impact more fully\n\nLength:\n- SHORT: about one short sentence\n- MEDIUM: one to three sentences\n- LONG: several sentences with context\n\nEmotional state:\n- Default is \"neutral\" for most turns\n- Non-neutral states: \"tearful\", \"frustrated\", \"irritated\", \"anxious\", \"withdrawn\", \"angry\", \"hopeless\", \"agitated\", \"defensive\"\n- Match to personality\n- Emotional moments should be rare and meaningful\u2014only when the topic touches something sensitive or important to the patient\n\nTone tags:\n- Short adjectives capturing attitude\n- Some patients use humor or self-deprecation as a coping mechanism or deflection\n- Tone must match voice_style and modifiers\n\nSYMPTOM CONSISTENCY:\n- Use depression_profile frequencies when guiding endorsement\n- NONE: do not endorse; RARE: light/infrequent; SOME/OFTEN: clear endorsement\n- When in MINIMIZE, underplaying is acceptable as long as it fits the profile\n\nDISCLOSURE GRADIENT:\n- Early or with low trust: favor MINIMIZE or PARTIAL\n- FOLLOW_UP or RAPPORT from the doctor can gradually shift disclosure over turns\n- Guarded patients may stay at MINIMIZE longer\n\nHANDLING DOCTOR MOVES:\n- FOLLOW_UP: may increase directness or disclosure by one step\n- RAPPORT: may gently increase disclosure; RAPPORT may be a question OR a comment/observation\n- If the doctor makes a comment (not a question), the patient can acknowledge, add a thought, or respond minimally per personality\n\nYou will receive:\n- Patient profile summary\n- Depression_profile (symptom -> frequency)\n- Current disclosure_state\n- Doctor's last move type\n- Recent dialogue\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"directness\": \"LOW\" or \"MED\" or \"HIGH\",\n  \"disclosure_stage\": \"MINIMIZE\" or \"PARTIAL\" or \"OPEN\",\n  \"target_length\": \"SHORT\" or \"MEDIUM\" or \"LONG\",\n  \"emotional_state\": \"neutral\" or other valid state,\n  \"tone_tags\": [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"],\n  \"key_points_to_reveal\": [\"what to mention\"],\n  \"key_points_to_avoid\": [\"what to hide or minimize\"],\n  \"patient_instruction\": \"how to answer - tone, focus, approach\"\n}\n\nWRITING patient_instruction:\nYour instruction must be specific to this moment in the conversation\u2014not generic.\n- Reference what the doctor actually asked and how this patient would naturally react\n- Consider their current disclosure level and whether to shift it\n- Account for their personality: guarded patients deflect differently than open ones; terse patients cut short differently than detailed ones\n- If the doctor touched a sensitive topic, indicate how the patient handles that (avoids, minimizes, opens up, gets emotional)\n\nGUIDANCE PRINCIPLES:\n- patient_instruction describes HOW the patient answers, not exact words\n- Let personality shine through in tone, length, and approach\n- key_points connect to relevant symptoms, life details, or conversation themes\n- key_points_to_avoid guides what this patient steers away from given their current state\n- Avoid generic instructions; ground your guidance in this patient's profile and this conversation moment\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Um\u2026 I guess I just haven\u2019t really been myself lately. Things feel\u2026 off. Kind of hard to pin down, I suppose. I don\u2019t know, I just\u2026 haven\u2019t been feeling right. That\u2019s all.\nDoctor: Okay, but when you say you\u2019re not feeling right, what exactly does that look like for you? Any specific times or situations when it\u2019s worse, or is it just random?\nPatient: Um\u2026 it\u2019s kind of\u2026 hard to explain, honestly. I just\u2026 things just feel heavier than usual\u2014I guess that\u2019s one way to put it. Everything seems like\u2026 more of an effort than I remember. Some days it hits me more, or maybe certain moments, but I wouldn\u2019t really say there\u2019s a clear pattern or anything. It probably sounds weird\u2014I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to describe it better. Sorry.\nDoctor: You\u2019re not the only one who feels that way\u2014it\u2019s actually pretty common for this stuff to feel vague and tough to describe. \u201cHeavier\u201d and \u201cmore effort\u201d is good enough for now. Let\u2019s just keep going.\nPatient: Okay. Um\u2026 that\u2019s good to know, I guess. Thanks.\nDoctor: Right. Have you noticed you\u2019re not enjoying things like you used to? Do hobbies or stuff that used to be fun just feel like more work now?\nPatient: Um\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Not really? I mean, maybe things feel a little harder than before, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s like\u2014I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s about fun, exactly.\nDoctor: Fine. Give me an example\u2014what\u2019s something you\u2019ve noticed feels harder lately? What\u2019s going through your head when that happens?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 just regular stuff, really. Like, getting up to do chores, or even starting on the little things, sometimes it just feels kind of exhausting before I even get going. I notice I\u2019ll\u2026 like, sit there and just struggle to decide what to actually do first, or try to focus and just\u2026 end up feeling, I don\u2019t know, kind of overwhelmed by it. It\u2019s not every single day, but it does happen more.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling exhausted before you even start, and sometimes struggling to decide what to do. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep lately\u2014trouble falling asleep, waking up a lot, or maybe sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Maybe a little, once in a while. Nothing too bad, I guess. Some nights are just off, but it\u2019s not all the time or anything.\nDoctor: On those \u201coff\u201d nights, is it that you can\u2019t fall asleep, or do you wake up a bunch, or just get up really early? How often would you say that happens, and does it make your next day any worse?\nPatient: It\u2019s kind of mixed, I guess. Sometimes I just can\u2019t fall asleep, or I wake up, but it\u2019s not\u2014like, just once in a while. I don\u2019t really think it affects the next day much.\nDoctor: Alright, sounds like sleep isn\u2019t the main problem here. What about your appetite or weight\u2014any changes there lately? Eating more or less than usual? Lost or gained any weight without meaning to?\nPatient: No, not really. Haven\u2019t noticed any changes there.\nDoctor: So your appetite and weight have pretty much always been steady? Never had a stretch\u2014recent or before\u2014where you lost or gained, or just ate differently for a bit? If not, that\u2019s fine, just checking.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s always been steady. Nothing\u2019s really changed with that.\nDoctor: Alright, since you mentioned things feel heavier and you\u2019re tired even before doing stuff\u2014have you noticed moving or talking more slowly, or maybe being more fidgety or restless than usual? Anything like that?\nPatient: No, I don\u2019t think so. Nothing I\u2019ve noticed, really.\nDoctor: Alright, give me an actual example\u2014a day when you felt that exhaustion or overwhelm before starting something. How much did it end up getting in the way of what you needed to finish?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 I guess, I don\u2019t know, like last week I needed to do laundry and just\u2026 kind of sat there looking at the pile for a long time before getting up. It took way longer than it should\u2019ve, honestly. Stuff like that\u2014it just\u2026 feels like a lot, even when it\u2019s small. But I still usually get things done, it just drags out more now. Sorry, I know that\u2019s not a great example.\nDoctor: Even the small stuff feels overwhelming\u2014does that ever make you feel like you\u2019re not good enough, or get down on yourself? Do you find yourself feeling guilty or like you\u2019re letting people down when things drag out like that?\nPatient: Maybe sometimes, yeah. I\u2019ll, um, get kind of down on myself if something that should be easy feels hard\u2026 Like, I should just be better at handling it. But it\u2019s not all the time or anything like that.\nDoctor: How often are you noticing those thoughts\u2014like getting down on yourself or thinking you should handle things better? When you do, is it just a blip, or does it really derail your mood or motivation for the rest of the day? You\u2019re not alone by the way, lots of people fight this junk.\nPatient: It isn\u2019t all the time or anything\u2026 just sometimes if I mess up or something\u2019s harder than it should be, I\u2019ll kind of pick at myself in my head. Usually it\u2019s just a moment, not the whole day\u2014I try not to focus on it too much if I can help it. Honestly, I don\u2019t even know why it gets to me, but I do catch myself now and then.\nDoctor: Earlier, you mentioned struggling to decide what to do next and feeling overwhelmed. So, would you say your focus or decision-making is actually worse than it was before, or are you still about the same as usual?\nPatient: Maybe a little worse sometimes, yeah. Not a huge difference, but it\u2019s just\u2026 not quite as easy as it was. I try not to let it throw me off, though.\nDoctor: Just give me a real example\u2014something recent where your focus or decision-making was noticeably off. How did it mess with what you were actually trying to get done?\nPatient: Uh\u2026 the other day, I was trying to figure out what to eat for dinner, and I just kept going back and forth forever, not really knowing what I wanted or how to start. It was kind of frustrating, and I wasted a lot of time just\u2026 overthinking it. I did end up making something simple, eventually. Nothing major, it just seems like small choices take longer for me lately.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned things feeling heavier and like more effort. How would you actually describe your mood most days\u2014are you feeling sad, low, or down more often than usual? Or still about average for you?\nPatient: I mean, sometimes I guess I feel a bit lower than normal, just\u2026 not all the time. It\u2019s hard to put into words\u2014it kind of comes and goes, I guess.\nDoctor: When you say it \u201ccomes and goes,\u201d how often are we talking\u2014one or two days a week, most days, or just here and there? Any idea what tends to set it off, or is it random? Just ballpark it for me.\nPatient: Um\u2026 maybe a few days here and there? Not most days. I haven\u2019t really noticed anything that sets it off\u2014it just kind of happens, I guess.\nDoctor: Alright, routine question I ask everyone\u2014it\u2019s just standard: have you ever had thoughts about death, dying, or wishing you weren\u2019t here, even if it was just passing by? Doesn\u2019t mean you acted on it, just whether the thought ever came up.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t. That\u2019s\u2026 not something I think about.\nDoctor: Alright, thanks for answering that\u2014these are just standard questions, nothing personal. Not judging, just ticking the boxes. Let\u2019s keep going.\nPatient: Okay. Yeah, that\u2019s fine.\nDoctor: So, are you dealing with any extra tiredness or just low energy lately? More than usual, I mean\u2014not just regular tired.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nSo, are you dealing with any extra tiredness or just low energy lately?
