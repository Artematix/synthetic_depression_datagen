It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hey, thanks. I\u2019ve been okay overall. Nothing major going on, just kind of all over the place sometimes. I tend to get a bit scatterbrained, especially when I have a lot on my plate. It\u2019s like, my thoughts can feel kind of jumpy, and some days it\u2019s tough to focus on things. Occasionally I get kind of restless too, like I want to keep busy but can\u2019t decide what to focus on. Otherwise, everything\u2019s mostly normal\u2014just dealing with some everyday disorganization, I guess.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Alex, and you\u2019re definitely not alone\u2014feeling scattered is something a lot of people go through, but it can definitely be tough when it disrupts your days. When you mention having trouble focusing and feeling restless, does this tend to happen most days, or does it feel more like occasional spells? Also, how much does it impact your ability to get things done at work or at home?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s more off and on\u2014not every single day, but it pops up enough that I notice. Some weeks are better than others. I wouldn\u2019t say it totally knocks out my productivity, but it does slow me down at times. Sometimes it\u2019s just hard to get a task finished, whether I\u2019m at work testing software or even doing simple stuff around the house. I\u2019ll get distracted or end up jumping between things and then I realize I\u2019ve left stuff half done. It can be kind of frustrating, but overall I manage\u2014just takes some extra effort.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re handling a really busy life with a lot on your plate, and that definitely takes effort. Can you tell me a bit about what your typical day looks like\u2014both at work and at home\u2014and how you try to keep things organized or cope on those tougher days?\nPatient: Sure. On a typical workday, I do a lot of software testing, so it\u2019s a lot of checking details and keeping track of changes. I try to use checklists or set reminders, but honestly, things still slip through sometimes. At home it\u2019s kind of the same\u2014I might forget chores or leave tasks half done unless someone reminds me or I write them down. I don\u2019t have a perfect system or anything, but I do my best to use notes or alarms and just try to keep track as well as I can. Mostly I\u2019m just managing it day by day.\nDoctor: Thank you for being so open, Alex. With everything you\u2019ve got going on and the challenge of keeping track of details, it makes sense that it could feel a bit overwhelming at times.

I tend to get a bit scatterbrained, especially when I have a lot on my plate. It\u2019s like, my thoughts can feel kind of jumpy, and some days it\u2019s tough to focus on things. Occasionally I get kind of restless too, like I want to keep busy but can\u2019t decide what to focus on.

When you mention having trouble focusing and feeling restless, does this tend to happen most days, or does it feel more like occasional spells? Also, how much does it impact your ability to get things done at work or at home?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s more off and on\u2014not every single day, but it pops up enough that I notice. Some weeks are better than others. I wouldn\u2019t say it totally knocks out my productivity, but it does slow me down at times.

I try to use checklists or set reminders, but honestly, things still slip through sometimes. At home it\u2019s kind of the same\u2014I might forget chores or leave tasks half done unless someone reminds me or I write them down.

It\u2019s more that I just get frustrated with myself when I forget things or can\u2019t focus.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hey, thanks. I\u2019ve been okay overall. Nothing major going on, just kind of all over the place sometimes. I tend to get a bit scatterbrained, especially when I have a lot on my plate. It\u2019s like, my thoughts can feel kind of jumpy, and some days it\u2019s tough to focus on things. Occasionally I get kind of restless too, like I want to keep busy but can\u2019t decide what to focus on. Otherwise, everything\u2019s mostly normal\u2014just dealing with some everyday disorganization, I guess.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Alex, and you\u2019re definitely not alone\u2014feeling scattered is something a lot of people go through, but it can definitely be tough when it disrupts your days. When you mention having trouble focusing and feeling restless, does this tend to happen most days, or does it feel more like occasional spells? Also, how much does it impact your ability to get things done at work or at home?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s more off and on\u2014not every single day, but it pops up enough that I notice. Some weeks are better than others. I wouldn\u2019t say it totally knocks out my productivity, but it does slow me down at times. Sometimes it\u2019s just hard to get a task finished, whether I\u2019m at work testing software or even doing simple stuff around the house. I\u2019ll get distracted or end up jumping between things and then I realize I\u2019ve left stuff half done. It can be kind of frustrating, but overall I manage\u2014just takes some extra effort.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re handling a really busy life with a lot on your plate, and that definitely takes effort. Can you tell me a bit about what your typical day looks like\u2014both at work and at home\u2014and how you try to keep things organized or cope on those tougher days?\nPatient: Sure. On a typical workday, I do a lot of software testing, so it\u2019s a lot of checking details and keeping track of changes. I try to use checklists or set reminders, but honestly, things still slip through sometimes. At home it\u2019s kind of the same\u2014I might forget chores or leave tasks half done unless someone reminds me or I write them down. I don\u2019t have a perfect system or anything, but I do my best to use notes or alarms and just try to keep track as well as I can. Mostly I\u2019m just managing it day by day.\nDoctor: Thank you for being so open, Alex. With everything you\u2019ve got going on and the challenge of keeping track of details, it makes sense that it could feel a bit overwhelming at times. I\u2019d like to ask\u2014have you found yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during all this, even if just for a few days at a time?\nPatient: No, I wouldn\u2019t say I feel depressed or hopeless. It\u2019s more that I just get frustrated with myself when I forget things or can\u2019t focus. Mostly it\u2019s just that scattered feeling.\nDoctor: That\u2019s really helpful to know, and it\u2019s totally understandable to feel some frustration when things slip by. Outside of work and home chores, are there any activities or hobbies you find help you unwind or give you a break from those day-to-day stressors?\nPatient: Yeah, I like to kind of reset by playing video games or reading now and then. Those give me a way to unwind after work. Sometimes I end up getting a bit distracted even with hobbies\u2014like starting a game and not finishing, or jumping between books\u2014but I still enjoy them. It\u2019s just a nice way to relax regardless.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have some hobbies that help you relax, even if they don\u2019t always hold your attention start to finish. While we're getting the full picture, have you noticed any significant changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014maybe eating much more or less than usual, or weight changes that caught your attention?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes with my appetite or weight.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hey, thanks. I\u2019ve been okay overall. Nothing major going on, just kind of all over the place sometimes. I tend to get a bit scatterbrained, especially when I have a lot on my plate. It\u2019s like, my thoughts can feel kind of jumpy, and some days it\u2019s tough to focus on things. Occasionally I get kind of restless too, like I want to keep busy but can\u2019t decide what to focus on. Otherwise, everything\u2019s mostly normal\u2014just dealing with some everyday disorganization, I guess.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Alex, and you\u2019re definitely not alone\u2014feeling scattered is something a lot of people go through, but it can definitely be tough when it disrupts your days. When you mention having trouble focusing and feeling restless, does this tend to happen most days, or does it feel more like occasional spells? Also, how much does it impact your ability to get things done at work or at home?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s more off and on\u2014not every single day, but it pops up enough that I notice. Some weeks are better than others. I wouldn\u2019t say it totally knocks out my productivity, but it does slow me down at times. Sometimes it\u2019s just hard to get a task finished, whether I\u2019m at work testing software or even doing simple stuff around the house. I\u2019ll get distracted or end up jumping between things and then I realize I\u2019ve left stuff half done. It can be kind of frustrating, but overall I manage\u2014just takes some extra effort.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re handling a really busy life with a lot on your plate, and that definitely takes effort. Can you tell me a bit about what your typical day looks like\u2014both at work and at home\u2014and how you try to keep things organized or cope on those tougher days?\nPatient: Sure. On a typical workday, I do a lot of software testing, so it\u2019s a lot of checking details and keeping track of changes. I try to use checklists or set reminders, but honestly, things still slip through sometimes. At home it\u2019s kind of the same\u2014I might forget chores or leave tasks half done unless someone reminds me or I write them down. I don\u2019t have a perfect system or anything, but I do my best to use notes or alarms and just try to keep track as well as I can. Mostly I\u2019m just managing it day by day.\nDoctor: Thank you for being so open, Alex. With everything you\u2019ve got going on and the challenge of keeping track of details, it makes sense that it could feel a bit overwhelming at times. I\u2019d like to ask\u2014have you found yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during all this, even if just for a few days at a time?\nPatient: No, I wouldn\u2019t say I feel depressed or hopeless. It\u2019s more that I just get frustrated with myself when I forget things or can\u2019t focus. Mostly it\u2019s just that scattered feeling.\nDoctor: That\u2019s really helpful to know, and it\u2019s totally understandable to feel some frustration when things slip by. Outside of work and home chores, are there any activities or hobbies you find help you unwind or give you a break from those day-to-day stressors?\nPatient: Yeah, I like to kind of reset by playing video games or reading now and then. Those give me a way to unwind after work. Sometimes I end up getting a bit distracted even with hobbies\u2014like starting a game and not finishing, or jumping between books\u2014but I still enjoy them. It\u2019s just a nice way to relax regardless.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have some hobbies that help you relax, even if they don\u2019t always hold your attention start to finish. While we're getting the full picture, have you noticed any significant changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014maybe eating much more or less than usual, or weight changes that caught your attention?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes with my appetite or weight.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hey, thanks. I\u2019ve been okay overall. Nothing major going on, just kind of all over the place sometimes. I tend to get a bit scatterbrained, especially when I have a lot on my plate. It\u2019s like, my thoughts can feel kind of jumpy, and some days it\u2019s tough to focus on things. Occasionally I get kind of restless too, like I want to keep busy but can\u2019t decide what to focus on. Otherwise, everything\u2019s mostly normal\u2014just dealing with some everyday disorganization, I guess.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Alex, and you\u2019re definitely not alone\u2014feeling scattered is something a lot of people go through, but it can definitely be tough when it disrupts your days. When you mention having trouble focusing and feeling restless, does this tend to happen most days, or does it feel more like occasional spells? Also, how much does it impact your ability to get things done at work or at home?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s more off and on\u2014not every single day, but it pops up enough that I notice. Some weeks are better than others. I wouldn\u2019t say it totally knocks out my productivity, but it does slow me down at times. Sometimes it\u2019s just hard to get a task finished, whether I\u2019m at work testing software or even doing simple stuff around the house. I\u2019ll get distracted or end up jumping between things and then I realize I\u2019ve left stuff half done. It can be kind of frustrating, but overall I manage\u2014just takes some extra effort.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re handling a really busy life with a lot on your plate, and that definitely takes effort. Can you tell me a bit about what your typical day looks like\u2014both at work and at home\u2014and how you try to keep things organized or cope on those tougher days?\nPatient: Sure. On a typical workday, I do a lot of software testing, so it\u2019s a lot of checking details and keeping track of changes. I try to use checklists or set reminders, but honestly, things still slip through sometimes. At home it\u2019s kind of the same\u2014I might forget chores or leave tasks half done unless someone reminds me or I write them down. I don\u2019t have a perfect system or anything, but I do my best to use notes or alarms and just try to keep track as well as I can. Mostly I\u2019m just managing it day by day.\nDoctor: Thank you for being so open, Alex. With everything you\u2019ve got going on and the challenge of keeping track of details, it makes sense that it could feel a bit overwhelming at times. I\u2019d like to ask\u2014have you found yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during all this, even if just for a few days at a time?\nPatient: No, I wouldn\u2019t say I feel depressed or hopeless. It\u2019s more that I just get frustrated with myself when I forget things or can\u2019t focus. Mostly it\u2019s just that scattered feeling.\nDoctor: That\u2019s really helpful to know, and it\u2019s totally understandable to feel some frustration when things slip by. Outside of work and home chores, are there any activities or hobbies you find help you unwind or give you a break from those day-to-day stressors?\nPatient: Yeah, I like to kind of reset by playing video games or reading now and then. Those give me a way to unwind after work. Sometimes I end up getting a bit distracted even with hobbies\u2014like starting a game and not finishing, or jumping between books\u2014but I still enjoy them. It\u2019s just a nice way to relax regardless.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have some hobbies that help you relax, even if they don\u2019t always hold your attention start to finish. While we're getting the full picture, have you noticed any significant changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014maybe eating much more or less than usual, or weight changes that caught your attention?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes with my appetite or weight. Everything there seems normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Alex. Sleep often plays a big role in focus and energy\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you'd like?\nPatient: My sleep's been normal\u2014I haven\u2019t really had any issues with it.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear your sleep is steady\u2014that\u2019s something a lot of people wish for!

However, brief moments of FOLLOW_UP or RAPPORT can still be valuable for patient comfort.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The last few turns of dialogue, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"response_instruction\": \"one or two sentences describing what the doctor model should ask about and how, written as instructions\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP when the last reply is unclear, very brief, strongly downplays a problem, or raises an important safety or impact question you still need to clarify.\n- Also use it when the patient seems distressed and needs a moment to feel heard before moving on.\n- response_instruction should describe a brief acknowledgement of what the patient said and one open question that invites them to say more.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT when the patient shares something personal or emotional that calls for a short, human response, or when a bit of life context will clearly help you interpret their symptoms.\n- Even in low-turns mode, acknowledging the patient's experience helps them feel safe.\n- Keep this mode concise but genuine.\n- response_instruction should describe a short validating comment and one open question that fits the doctor's persona and microstyle.\n\nDSM:\n- When there are DSM symptom keys remaining, DSM is often the preferred choice if the current topic is reasonably understood.\n- Use DSM to open or revisit a DSM symptom area that still needs coverage.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n- response_instruction should state which DSM area to explore next and how to approach it in a way that fits the doctor persona and microstyle, including asking about how often it happens and how much it affects the patient.\n\nresponse_instruction must always be written as instructions to the doctor model about what to do and how to ask, not as the doctor's actual spoken question.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hey, thanks. I\u2019ve been okay overall. Nothing major going on, just kind of all over the place sometimes. I tend to get a bit scatterbrained, especially when I have a lot on my plate. It\u2019s like, my thoughts can feel kind of jumpy, and some days it\u2019s tough to focus on things. Occasionally I get kind of restless too, like I want to keep busy but can\u2019t decide what to focus on. Otherwise, everything\u2019s mostly normal\u2014just dealing with some everyday disorganization, I guess.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Alex, and you\u2019re definitely not alone\u2014feeling scattered is something a lot of people go through, but it can definitely be tough when it disrupts your days. When you mention having trouble focusing and feeling restless, does this tend to happen most days, or does it feel more like occasional spells? Also, how much does it impact your ability to get things done at work or at home?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s more off and on\u2014not every single day, but it pops up enough that I notice. Some weeks are better than others. I wouldn\u2019t say it totally knocks out my productivity, but it does slow me down at times. Sometimes it\u2019s just hard to get a task finished, whether I\u2019m at work testing software or even doing simple stuff around the house. I\u2019ll get distracted or end up jumping between things and then I realize I\u2019ve left stuff half done. It can be kind of frustrating, but overall I manage\u2014just takes some extra effort.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re handling a really busy life with a lot on your plate, and that definitely takes effort. Can you tell me a bit about what your typical day looks like\u2014both at work and at home\u2014and how you try to keep things organized or cope on those tougher days?\nPatient: Sure. On a typical workday, I do a lot of software testing, so it\u2019s a lot of checking details and keeping track of changes. I try to use checklists or set reminders, but honestly, things still slip through sometimes. At home it\u2019s kind of the same\u2014I might forget chores or leave tasks half done unless someone reminds me or I write them down. I don\u2019t have a perfect system or anything, but I do my best to use notes or alarms and just try to keep track as well as I can. Mostly I\u2019m just managing it day by day.\nDoctor: Thank you for being so open, Alex. With everything you\u2019ve got going on and the challenge of keeping track of details, it makes sense that it could feel a bit overwhelming at times. I\u2019d like to ask\u2014have you found yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during all this, even if just for a few days at a time?\nPatient: No, I wouldn\u2019t say I feel depressed or hopeless. It\u2019s more that I just get frustrated with myself when I forget things or can\u2019t focus. Mostly it\u2019s just that scattered feeling.\nDoctor: That\u2019s really helpful to know, and it\u2019s totally understandable to feel some frustration when things slip by. Outside of work and home chores, are there any activities or hobbies you find help you unwind or give you a break from those day-to-day stressors?\nPatient: Yeah, I like to kind of reset by playing video games or reading now and then. Those give me a way to unwind after work. Sometimes I end up getting a bit distracted even with hobbies\u2014like starting a game and not finishing, or jumping between books\u2014but I still enjoy them. It\u2019s just a nice way to relax regardless.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have some hobbies that help you relax, even if they don\u2019t always hold your attention start to finish. While we're getting the full picture, have you noticed any significant changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014maybe eating much more or less than usual, or weight changes that caught your attention?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes with my appetite or weight. Everything there seems normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Alex. Sleep often plays a big role in focus and energy\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you'd like?\nPatient: My sleep's been normal\u2014I haven\u2019t really had any issues with it.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear your sleep is steady\u2014that\u2019s something a lot of people wish for! Besides gaming and reading, is there anything or anyone you find especially helpful when you\u2019re having a rough or extra scattered day, like friends, family, or another routine that grounds you?\nPatient: If things feel extra scattered, I might reach out to my sister or a friend and talk for a bit. But for the most part, I just try to rely on my lists and reminders to help refocus. I don't have any set routines or anything\u2014just do what I can as it comes up.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014sometimes just having someone to talk things through with, or relying on your own systems, can make all the difference.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hey, thanks. I\u2019ve been okay overall. Nothing major going on, just kind of all over the place sometimes. I tend to get a bit scatterbrained, especially when I have a lot on my plate. It\u2019s like, my thoughts can feel kind of jumpy, and some days it\u2019s tough to focus on things. Occasionally I get kind of restless too, like I want to keep busy but can\u2019t decide what to focus on. Otherwise, everything\u2019s mostly normal\u2014just dealing with some everyday disorganization, I guess.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Alex, and you\u2019re definitely not alone\u2014feeling scattered is something a lot of people go through, but it can definitely be tough when it disrupts your days. When you mention having trouble focusing and feeling restless, does this tend to happen most days, or does it feel more like occasional spells? Also, how much does it impact your ability to get things done at work or at home?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s more off and on\u2014not every single day, but it pops up enough that I notice. Some weeks are better than others. I wouldn\u2019t say it totally knocks out my productivity, but it does slow me down at times. Sometimes it\u2019s just hard to get a task finished, whether I\u2019m at work testing software or even doing simple stuff around the house. I\u2019ll get distracted or end up jumping between things and then I realize I\u2019ve left stuff half done. It can be kind of frustrating, but overall I manage\u2014just takes some extra effort.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re handling a really busy life with a lot on your plate, and that definitely takes effort. Can you tell me a bit about what your typical day looks like\u2014both at work and at home\u2014and how you try to keep things organized or cope on those tougher days?\nPatient: Sure. On a typical workday, I do a lot of software testing, so it\u2019s a lot of checking details and keeping track of changes. I try to use checklists or set reminders, but honestly, things still slip through sometimes. At home it\u2019s kind of the same\u2014I might forget chores or leave tasks half done unless someone reminds me or I write them down. I don\u2019t have a perfect system or anything, but I do my best to use notes or alarms and just try to keep track as well as I can. Mostly I\u2019m just managing it day by day.\nDoctor: Thank you for being so open, Alex. With everything you\u2019ve got going on and the challenge of keeping track of details, it makes sense that it could feel a bit overwhelming at times. I\u2019d like to ask\u2014have you found yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during all this, even if just for a few days at a time?\nPatient: No, I wouldn\u2019t say I feel depressed or hopeless. It\u2019s more that I just get frustrated with myself when I forget things or can\u2019t focus. Mostly it\u2019s just that scattered feeling.\nDoctor: That\u2019s really helpful to know, and it\u2019s totally understandable to feel some frustration when things slip by. Outside of work and home chores, are there any activities or hobbies you find help you unwind or give you a break from those day-to-day stressors?\nPatient: Yeah, I like to kind of reset by playing video games or reading now and then. Those give me a way to unwind after work. Sometimes I end up getting a bit distracted even with hobbies\u2014like starting a game and not finishing, or jumping between books\u2014but I still enjoy them. It\u2019s just a nice way to relax regardless.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have some hobbies that help you relax, even if they don\u2019t always hold your attention start to finish. While we're getting the full picture, have you noticed any significant changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014maybe eating much more or less than usual, or weight changes that caught your attention?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes with my appetite or weight. Everything there seems normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Alex. Sleep often plays a big role in focus and energy\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you'd like?\nPatient: My sleep's been normal\u2014I haven\u2019t really had any issues with it.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear your sleep is steady\u2014that\u2019s something a lot of people wish for! Besides gaming and reading, is there anything or anyone you find especially helpful when you\u2019re having a rough or extra scattered day, like friends, family, or another routine that grounds you?\nPatient: If things feel extra scattered, I might reach out to my sister or a friend and talk for a bit. But for the most part, I just try to rely on my lists and reminders to help refocus. I don't have any set routines or anything\u2014just do what I can as it comes up.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014sometimes just having someone to talk things through with, or relying on your own systems, can make all the difference. How would you say the level of stress you\u2019re feeling these days compares to how things have been for you in the past?\nPatient: I\u2019d say my stress level is about the same as usual. I still have times where I feel scattered or distracted, but overall nothing\u2019s changed much. Things feel pretty normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, Alex\u2014it helps to understand your baseline. How about your energy level?

I tend to get a bit scatterbrained, especially when I have a lot on my plate. It\u2019s like, my thoughts can feel kind of jumpy, and some days it\u2019s tough to focus on things. Occasionally I get kind of restless too, like I want to keep busy but can\u2019t decide what to focus on. Otherwise, everything\u2019s mostly normal\u2014just dealing with some everyday disorganization, I guess.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Alex, and you\u2019re definitely not alone\u2014feeling scattered is something a lot of people go through, but it can definitely be tough when it disrupts your days. When you mention having trouble focusing and feeling restless, does this tend to happen most days, or does it feel more like occasional spells? Also, how much does it impact your ability to get things done at work or at home?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s more off and on\u2014not every single day, but it pops up enough that I notice. Some weeks are better than others. I wouldn\u2019t say it totally knocks out my productivity, but it does slow me down at times. Sometimes it\u2019s just hard to get a task finished, whether I\u2019m at work testing software or even doing simple stuff around the house. I\u2019ll get distracted or end up jumping between things and then I realize I\u2019ve left stuff half done. It can be kind of frustrating, but overall I manage\u2014just takes some extra effort.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re handling a really busy life with a lot on your plate, and that definitely takes effort. Can you tell me a bit about what your typical day looks like\u2014both at work and at home\u2014and how you try to keep things organized or cope on those tougher days?\nPatient: Sure. On a typical workday, I do a lot of software testing, so it\u2019s a lot of checking details and keeping track of changes. I try to use checklists or set reminders, but honestly, things still slip through sometimes. At home it\u2019s kind of the same\u2014I might forget chores or leave tasks half done unless someone reminds me or I write them down. I don\u2019t have a perfect system or anything, but I do my best to use notes or alarms and just try to keep track as well as I can. Mostly I\u2019m just managing it day by day.\nDoctor: Thank you for being so open, Alex. With everything you\u2019ve got going on and the challenge of keeping track of details, it makes sense that it could feel a bit overwhelming at times. I\u2019d like to ask\u2014have you found yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during all this, even if just for a few days at a time?\nPatient: No, I wouldn\u2019t say I feel depressed or hopeless. It\u2019s more that I just get frustrated with myself when I forget things or can\u2019t focus. Mostly it\u2019s just that scattered feeling.\nDoctor: That\u2019s really helpful to know, and it\u2019s totally understandable to feel some frustration when things slip by. Outside of work and home chores, are there any activities or hobbies you find help you unwind or give you a break from those day-to-day stressors?\nPatient: Yeah, I like to kind of reset by playing video games or reading now and then. Those give me a way to unwind after work. Sometimes I end up getting a bit distracted even with hobbies\u2014like starting a game and not finishing, or jumping between books\u2014but I still enjoy them. It\u2019s just a nice way to relax regardless.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have some hobbies that help you relax, even if they don\u2019t always hold your attention start to finish. While we're getting the full picture, have you noticed any significant changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014maybe eating much more or less than usual, or weight changes that caught your attention?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes with my appetite or weight. Everything there seems normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Alex. Sleep often plays a big role in focus and energy\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you'd like?\nPatient: My sleep's been normal\u2014I haven\u2019t really had any issues with it.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear your sleep is steady\u2014that\u2019s something a lot of people wish for! Besides gaming and reading, is there anything or anyone you find especially helpful when you\u2019re having a rough or extra scattered day, like friends, family, or another routine that grounds you?\nPatient: If things feel extra scattered, I might reach out to my sister or a friend and talk for a bit. But for the most part, I just try to rely on my lists and reminders to help refocus. I don't have any set routines or anything\u2014just do what I can as it comes up.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014sometimes just having someone to talk things through with, or relying on your own systems, can make all the difference. How would you say the level of stress you\u2019re feeling these days compares to how things have been for you in the past?\nPatient: I\u2019d say my stress level is about the same as usual.

I\u2019d like to ask\u2014have you found yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during all this, even if just for a few days at a time?\nPatient: No, I wouldn\u2019t say I feel depressed or hopeless. It\u2019s more that I just get frustrated with myself when I forget things or can\u2019t focus. Mostly it\u2019s just that scattered feeling.\nDoctor: That\u2019s really helpful to know, and it\u2019s totally understandable to feel some frustration when things slip by. Outside of work and home chores, are there any activities or hobbies you find help you unwind or give you a break from those day-to-day stressors?\nPatient: Yeah, I like to kind of reset by playing video games or reading now and then. Those give me a way to unwind after work. Sometimes I end up getting a bit distracted even with hobbies\u2014like starting a game and not finishing, or jumping between books\u2014but I still enjoy them. It\u2019s just a nice way to relax regardless.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have some hobbies that help you relax, even if they don\u2019t always hold your attention start to finish. While we're getting the full picture, have you noticed any significant changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014maybe eating much more or less than usual, or weight changes that caught your attention?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes with my appetite or weight. Everything there seems normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Alex. Sleep often plays a big role in focus and energy\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you'd like?\nPatient: My sleep's been normal\u2014I haven\u2019t really had any issues with it.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear your sleep is steady\u2014that\u2019s something a lot of people wish for! Besides gaming and reading, is there anything or anyone you find especially helpful when you\u2019re having a rough or extra scattered day, like friends, family, or another routine that grounds you?\nPatient: If things feel extra scattered, I might reach out to my sister or a friend and talk for a bit. But for the most part, I just try to rely on my lists and reminders to help refocus. I don't have any set routines or anything\u2014just do what I can as it comes up.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014sometimes just having someone to talk things through with, or relying on your own systems, can make all the difference. How would you say the level of stress you\u2019re feeling these days compares to how things have been for you in the past?\nPatient: I\u2019d say my stress level is about the same as usual. I still have times where I feel scattered or distracted, but overall nothing\u2019s changed much. Things feel pretty normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, Alex\u2014it helps to understand your baseline. How about your energy level? Have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or running out of energy more quickly than usual, even when you're getting enough rest?\nPatient: No, my energy feels normal. I haven\u2019t noticed being more tired than usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear about your energy. Sometimes people feel either jumpy and restless, or the opposite\u2014slowed down in their movements or thinking. Have you noticed yourself feeling more physically restless or \"revved up\" than usual, or maybe feeling slowed down in your body or thoughts lately?\nPatient: Yeah, sometimes I do feel a bit restless or, on the flip side, kind of spaced out or slowed down. It isn\u2019t all the time and usually just comes and goes. Those feelings can make it a bit harder to focus, but they don\u2019t actually stop me from doing what I need to do.\nDoctor: It\u2019s helpful to hear that you notice both restlessness and feeling spaced out at times. Do these shifts tend to come on during certain situations, like when you're feeling stressed or bored, or do they just happen randomly throughout your day? And when they do pop up, are they brief moments, or do they tend to last a while?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nIt\u2019s helpful to hear that you notice both restlessness and feeling spaced out at times.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hey, thanks. I\u2019ve been okay overall. Nothing major going on, just kind of all over the place sometimes. I tend to get a bit scatterbrained, especially when I have a lot on my plate. It\u2019s like, my thoughts can feel kind of jumpy, and some days it\u2019s tough to focus on things. Occasionally I get kind of restless too, like I want to keep busy but can\u2019t decide what to focus on. Otherwise, everything\u2019s mostly normal\u2014just dealing with some everyday disorganization, I guess.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Alex, and you\u2019re definitely not alone\u2014feeling scattered is something a lot of people go through, but it can definitely be tough when it disrupts your days. When you mention having trouble focusing and feeling restless, does this tend to happen most days, or does it feel more like occasional spells? Also, how much does it impact your ability to get things done at work or at home?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s more off and on\u2014not every single day, but it pops up enough that I notice. Some weeks are better than others. I wouldn\u2019t say it totally knocks out my productivity, but it does slow me down at times. Sometimes it\u2019s just hard to get a task finished, whether I\u2019m at work testing software or even doing simple stuff around the house. I\u2019ll get distracted or end up jumping between things and then I realize I\u2019ve left stuff half done. It can be kind of frustrating, but overall I manage\u2014just takes some extra effort.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re handling a really busy life with a lot on your plate, and that definitely takes effort. Can you tell me a bit about what your typical day looks like\u2014both at work and at home\u2014and how you try to keep things organized or cope on those tougher days?\nPatient: Sure. On a typical workday, I do a lot of software testing, so it\u2019s a lot of checking details and keeping track of changes. I try to use checklists or set reminders, but honestly, things still slip through sometimes. At home it\u2019s kind of the same\u2014I might forget chores or leave tasks half done unless someone reminds me or I write them down. I don\u2019t have a perfect system or anything, but I do my best to use notes or alarms and just try to keep track as well as I can. Mostly I\u2019m just managing it day by day.\nDoctor: Thank you for being so open, Alex. With everything you\u2019ve got going on and the challenge of keeping track of details, it makes sense that it could feel a bit overwhelming at times.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hey, thanks. I\u2019ve been okay overall. Nothing major going on, just kind of all over the place sometimes. I tend to get a bit scatterbrained, especially when I have a lot on my plate. It\u2019s like, my thoughts can feel kind of jumpy, and some days it\u2019s tough to focus on things. Occasionally I get kind of restless too, like I want to keep busy but can\u2019t decide what to focus on. Otherwise, everything\u2019s mostly normal\u2014just dealing with some everyday disorganization, I guess.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Alex, and you\u2019re definitely not alone\u2014feeling scattered is something a lot of people go through, but it can definitely be tough when it disrupts your days. When you mention having trouble focusing and feeling restless, does this tend to happen most days, or does it feel more like occasional spells? Also, how much does it impact your ability to get things done at work or at home?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s more off and on\u2014not every single day, but it pops up enough that I notice. Some weeks are better than others. I wouldn\u2019t say it totally knocks out my productivity, but it does slow me down at times. Sometimes it\u2019s just hard to get a task finished, whether I\u2019m at work testing software or even doing simple stuff around the house. I\u2019ll get distracted or end up jumping between things and then I realize I\u2019ve left stuff half done. It can be kind of frustrating, but overall I manage\u2014just takes some extra effort.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re handling a really busy life with a lot on your plate, and that definitely takes effort. Can you tell me a bit about what your typical day looks like\u2014both at work and at home\u2014and how you try to keep things organized or cope on those tougher days?\nPatient: Sure. On a typical workday, I do a lot of software testing, so it\u2019s a lot of checking details and keeping track of changes. I try to use checklists or set reminders, but honestly, things still slip through sometimes. At home it\u2019s kind of the same\u2014I might forget chores or leave tasks half done unless someone reminds me or I write them down. I don\u2019t have a perfect system or anything, but I do my best to use notes or alarms and just try to keep track as well as I can. Mostly I\u2019m just managing it day by day.\nDoctor: Thank you for being so open, Alex. With everything you\u2019ve got going on and the challenge of keeping track of details, it makes sense that it could feel a bit overwhelming at times. I\u2019d like to ask\u2014have you found yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during all this, even if just for a few days at a time?\nPatient: No, I wouldn\u2019t say I feel depressed or hopeless. It\u2019s more that I just get frustrated with myself when I forget things or can\u2019t focus. Mostly it\u2019s just that scattered feeling.\nDoctor: That\u2019s really helpful to know, and it\u2019s totally understandable to feel some frustration when things slip by. Outside of work and home chores, are there any activities or hobbies you find help you unwind or give you a break from those day-to-day stressors?\nPatient: Yeah, I like to kind of reset by playing video games or reading now and then. Those give me a way to unwind after work. Sometimes I end up getting a bit distracted even with hobbies\u2014like starting a game and not finishing, or jumping between books\u2014but I still enjoy them. It\u2019s just a nice way to relax regardless.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have some hobbies that help you relax, even if they don\u2019t always hold your attention start to finish. While we're getting the full picture, have you noticed any significant changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014maybe eating much more or less than usual, or weight changes that caught your attention?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes with my appetite or weight. Everything there seems normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Alex. Sleep often plays a big role in focus and energy\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you'd like?\nPatient: My sleep's been normal\u2014I haven\u2019t really had any issues with it.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear your sleep is steady\u2014that\u2019s something a lot of people wish for! Besides gaming and reading, is there anything or anyone you find especially helpful when you\u2019re having a rough or extra scattered day, like friends, family, or another routine that grounds you?\nPatient: If things feel extra scattered, I might reach out to my sister or a friend and talk for a bit. But for the most part, I just try to rely on my lists and reminders to help refocus. I don't have any set routines or anything\u2014just do what I can as it comes up.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014sometimes just having someone to talk things through with, or relying on your own systems, can make all the difference. How would you say the level of stress you\u2019re feeling these days compares to how things have been for you in the past?\nPatient: I\u2019d say my stress level is about the same as usual. I still have times where I feel scattered or distracted, but overall nothing\u2019s changed much. Things feel pretty normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, Alex\u2014it helps to understand your baseline. How about your energy level? Have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or running out of energy more quickly than usual, even when you're getting enough rest?\nPatient: No, my energy feels normal. I haven\u2019t noticed being more tired than usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear about your energy. Sometimes people feel either jumpy and restless, or the opposite\u2014slowed down in their movements or thinking. Have you noticed yourself feeling more physically restless or \"revved up\" than usual, or maybe feeling slowed down in your body or thoughts lately?\nPatient: Yeah, sometimes I do feel a bit restless or, on the flip side, kind of spaced out or slowed down. It isn\u2019t all the time and usually just comes and goes. Those feelings can make it a bit harder to focus, but they don\u2019t actually stop me from doing what I need to do.\nDoctor: It\u2019s helpful to hear that you notice both restlessness and feeling spaced out at times. Do these shifts tend to come on during certain situations, like when you're feeling stressed or bored, or do they just happen randomly throughout your day? And when they do pop up, are they brief moments, or do they tend to last a while?\nPatient: They can happen during stressful or boring situations, but honestly, sometimes they just come out of nowhere. Usually, they\u2019re brief and don\u2019t last long. It\u2019s just more of a passing thing than something that sticks around.\nDoctor: Thanks for being so open about your experiences, Alex. Has there ever been a time when these feelings\u2014like restlessness, getting spaced out, or feeling scattered\u2014felt more intense or made you worry about how you were functioning, or has it always felt manageable overall?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThanks for being so open about your experiences, Alex.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hey, thanks. I\u2019ve been okay overall. Nothing major going on, just kind of all over the place sometimes. I tend to get a bit scatterbrained, especially when I have a lot on my plate. It\u2019s like, my thoughts can feel kind of jumpy, and some days it\u2019s tough to focus on things. Occasionally I get kind of restless too, like I want to keep busy but can\u2019t decide what to focus on. Otherwise, everything\u2019s mostly normal\u2014just dealing with some everyday disorganization, I guess.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Alex, and you\u2019re definitely not alone\u2014feeling scattered is something a lot of people go through, but it can definitely be tough when it disrupts your days. When you mention having trouble focusing and feeling restless, does this tend to happen most days, or does it feel more like occasional spells? Also, how much does it impact your ability to get things done at work or at home?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s more off and on\u2014not every single day, but it pops up enough that I notice. Some weeks are better than others. I wouldn\u2019t say it totally knocks out my productivity, but it does slow me down at times. Sometimes it\u2019s just hard to get a task finished, whether I\u2019m at work testing software or even doing simple stuff around the house. I\u2019ll get distracted or end up jumping between things and then I realize I\u2019ve left stuff half done. It can be kind of frustrating, but overall I manage\u2014just takes some extra effort.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re handling a really busy life with a lot on your plate, and that definitely takes effort. Can you tell me a bit about what your typical day looks like\u2014both at work and at home\u2014and how you try to keep things organized or cope on those tougher days?\nPatient: Sure. On a typical workday, I do a lot of software testing, so it\u2019s a lot of checking details and keeping track of changes. I try to use checklists or set reminders, but honestly, things still slip through sometimes. At home it\u2019s kind of the same\u2014I might forget chores or leave tasks half done unless someone reminds me or I write them down. I don\u2019t have a perfect system or anything, but I do my best to use notes or alarms and just try to keep track as well as I can. Mostly I\u2019m just managing it day by day.\nDoctor: Thank you for being so open, Alex. With everything you\u2019ve got going on and the challenge of keeping track of details, it makes sense that it could feel a bit overwhelming at times. I\u2019d like to ask\u2014have you found yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during all this, even if just for a few days at a time?\nPatient: No, I wouldn\u2019t say I feel depressed or hopeless. It\u2019s more that I just get frustrated with myself when I forget things or can\u2019t focus. Mostly it\u2019s just that scattered feeling.\nDoctor: That\u2019s really helpful to know, and it\u2019s totally understandable to feel some frustration when things slip by. Outside of work and home chores, are there any activities or hobbies you find help you unwind or give you a break from those day-to-day stressors?\nPatient: Yeah, I like to kind of reset by playing video games or reading now and then. Those give me a way to unwind after work. Sometimes I end up getting a bit distracted even with hobbies\u2014like starting a game and not finishing, or jumping between books\u2014but I still enjoy them. It\u2019s just a nice way to relax regardless.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have some hobbies that help you relax, even if they don\u2019t always hold your attention start to finish. While we're getting the full picture, have you noticed any significant changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014maybe eating much more or less than usual, or weight changes that caught your attention?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes with my appetite or weight. Everything there seems normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Alex. Sleep often plays a big role in focus and energy\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you'd like?\nPatient: My sleep's been normal\u2014I haven\u2019t really had any issues with it.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear your sleep is steady\u2014that\u2019s something a lot of people wish for! Besides gaming and reading, is there anything or anyone you find especially helpful when you\u2019re having a rough or extra scattered day, like friends, family, or another routine that grounds you?\nPatient: If things feel extra scattered, I might reach out to my sister or a friend and talk for a bit. But for the most part, I just try to rely on my lists and reminders to help refocus. I don't have any set routines or anything\u2014just do what I can as it comes up.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014sometimes just having someone to talk things through with, or relying on your own systems, can make all the difference. How would you say the level of stress you\u2019re feeling these days compares to how things have been for you in the past?\nPatient: I\u2019d say my stress level is about the same as usual. I still have times where I feel scattered or distracted, but overall nothing\u2019s changed much. Things feel pretty normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, Alex\u2014it helps to understand your baseline. How about your energy level? Have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or running out of energy more quickly than usual, even when you're getting enough rest?\nPatient: No, my energy feels normal. I haven\u2019t noticed being more tired than usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear about your energy. Sometimes people feel either jumpy and restless, or the opposite\u2014slowed down in their movements or thinking. Have you noticed yourself feeling more physically restless or \"revved up\" than usual, or maybe feeling slowed down in your body or thoughts lately?\nPatient: Yeah, sometimes I do feel a bit restless or, on the flip side, kind of spaced out or slowed down. It isn\u2019t all the time and usually just comes and goes. Those feelings can make it a bit harder to focus, but they don\u2019t actually stop me from doing what I need to do.\nDoctor: It\u2019s helpful to hear that you notice both restlessness and feeling spaced out at times. Do these shifts tend to come on during certain situations, like when you're feeling stressed or bored, or do they just happen randomly throughout your day? And when they do pop up, are they brief moments, or do they tend to last a while?\nPatient: They can happen during stressful or boring situations, but honestly, sometimes they just come out of nowhere. Usually, they\u2019re brief and don\u2019t last long. It\u2019s just more of a passing thing than something that sticks around.\nDoctor: Thanks for being so open about your experiences, Alex. Has there ever been a time when these feelings\u2014like restlessness, getting spaced out, or feeling scattered\u2014felt more intense or made you worry about how you were functioning, or has it always felt manageable overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s always felt manageable overall. Sometimes those scattered or restless feelings are more noticeable, but they\u2019ve never gotten to a point where I was really worried about how I was functioning. I can usually keep things on track, even if it takes a little extra effort.\nDoctor: I appreciate how you\u2019re able to keep things on track, even when it takes a bit more energy. Sometimes when people deal with distractibility or frustration, they can get down on themselves or feel unreasonably guilty for losing focus. Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough because of these challenges?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nI appreciate how you\u2019re able to keep things on track, even when it takes a bit more energy.

I\u2019d like to ask\u2014have you found yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during all this, even if just for a few days at a time?\nPatient: No, I wouldn\u2019t say I feel depressed or hopeless. It\u2019s more that I just get frustrated with myself when I forget things or can\u2019t focus. Mostly it\u2019s just that scattered feeling.\nDoctor: That\u2019s really helpful to know, and it\u2019s totally understandable to feel some frustration when things slip by. Outside of work and home chores, are there any activities or hobbies you find help you unwind or give you a break from those day-to-day stressors?\nPatient: Yeah, I like to kind of reset by playing video games or reading now and then. Those give me a way to unwind after work. Sometimes I end up getting a bit distracted even with hobbies\u2014like starting a game and not finishing, or jumping between books\u2014but I still enjoy them. It\u2019s just a nice way to relax regardless.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have some hobbies that help you relax, even if they don\u2019t always hold your attention start to finish. While we're getting the full picture, have you noticed any significant changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014maybe eating much more or less than usual, or weight changes that caught your attention?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes with my appetite or weight. Everything there seems normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Alex. Sleep often plays a big role in focus and energy\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you'd like?\nPatient: My sleep's been normal\u2014I haven\u2019t really had any issues with it.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear your sleep is steady\u2014that\u2019s something a lot of people wish for! Besides gaming and reading, is there anything or anyone you find especially helpful when you\u2019re having a rough or extra scattered day, like friends, family, or another routine that grounds you?\nPatient: If things feel extra scattered, I might reach out to my sister or a friend and talk for a bit. But for the most part, I just try to rely on my lists and reminders to help refocus. I don't have any set routines or anything\u2014just do what I can as it comes up.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014sometimes just having someone to talk things through with, or relying on your own systems, can make all the difference. How would you say the level of stress you\u2019re feeling these days compares to how things have been for you in the past?\nPatient: I\u2019d say my stress level is about the same as usual. I still have times where I feel scattered or distracted, but overall nothing\u2019s changed much. Things feel pretty normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, Alex\u2014it helps to understand your baseline. How about your energy level? Have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or running out of energy more quickly than usual, even when you're getting enough rest?\nPatient: No, my energy feels normal. I haven\u2019t noticed being more tired than usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear about your energy. Sometimes people feel either jumpy and restless, or the opposite\u2014slowed down in their movements or thinking. Have you noticed yourself feeling more physically restless or \"revved up\" than usual, or maybe feeling slowed down in your body or thoughts lately?\nPatient: Yeah, sometimes I do feel a bit restless or, on the flip side, kind of spaced out or slowed down. It isn\u2019t all the time and usually just comes and goes. Those feelings can make it a bit harder to focus, but they don\u2019t actually stop me from doing what I need to do.\nDoctor: It\u2019s helpful to hear that you notice both restlessness and feeling spaced out at times. Do these shifts tend to come on during certain situations, like when you're feeling stressed or bored, or do they just happen randomly throughout your day? And when they do pop up, are they brief moments, or do they tend to last a while?\nPatient: They can happen during stressful or boring situations, but honestly, sometimes they just come out of nowhere. Usually, they\u2019re brief and don\u2019t last long. It\u2019s just more of a passing thing than something that sticks around.\nDoctor: Thanks for being so open about your experiences, Alex. Has there ever been a time when these feelings\u2014like restlessness, getting spaced out, or feeling scattered\u2014felt more intense or made you worry about how you were functioning, or has it always felt manageable overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s always felt manageable overall. Sometimes those scattered or restless feelings are more noticeable, but they\u2019ve never gotten to a point where I was really worried about how I was functioning. I can usually keep things on track, even if it takes a little extra effort.\nDoctor: I appreciate how you\u2019re able to keep things on track, even when it takes a bit more energy. Sometimes when people deal with distractibility or frustration, they can get down on themselves or feel unreasonably guilty for losing focus. Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough because of these challenges?\nPatient: Sometimes I do get a bit frustrated with myself when I forget things or get off track, but I don\u2019t really feel guilty or like I\u2019m not good enough. I mostly just see it as something about the way I am\u2014kind of a quirk, I guess, more than anything to feel bad about.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nSometimes I do get a bit frustrated with myself when I forget things or get off track, but I don\u2019t really feel guilty or like I\u2019m not good enough.

I tend to get a bit scatterbrained, especially when I have a lot on my plate. It\u2019s like, my thoughts can feel kind of jumpy, and some days it\u2019s tough to focus on things. Occasionally I get kind of restless too, like I want to keep busy but can\u2019t decide what to focus on. Otherwise, everything\u2019s mostly normal\u2014just dealing with some everyday disorganization, I guess.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Alex, and you\u2019re definitely not alone\u2014feeling scattered is something a lot of people go through, but it can definitely be tough when it disrupts your days. When you mention having trouble focusing and feeling restless, does this tend to happen most days, or does it feel more like occasional spells? Also, how much does it impact your ability to get things done at work or at home?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s more off and on\u2014not every single day, but it pops up enough that I notice. Some weeks are better than others. I wouldn\u2019t say it totally knocks out my productivity, but it does slow me down at times. Sometimes it\u2019s just hard to get a task finished, whether I\u2019m at work testing software or even doing simple stuff around the house. I\u2019ll get distracted or end up jumping between things and then I realize I\u2019ve left stuff half done. It can be kind of frustrating, but overall I manage\u2014just takes some extra effort.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re handling a really busy life with a lot on your plate, and that definitely takes effort. Can you tell me a bit about what your typical day looks like\u2014both at work and at home\u2014and how you try to keep things organized or cope on those tougher days?\nPatient: Sure. On a typical workday, I do a lot of software testing, so it\u2019s a lot of checking details and keeping track of changes. I try to use checklists or set reminders, but honestly, things still slip through sometimes. At home it\u2019s kind of the same\u2014I might forget chores or leave tasks half done unless someone reminds me or I write them down. I don\u2019t have a perfect system or anything, but I do my best to use notes or alarms and just try to keep track as well as I can. Mostly I\u2019m just managing it day by day.\nDoctor: Thank you for being so open, Alex. With everything you\u2019ve got going on and the challenge of keeping track of details, it makes sense that it could feel a bit overwhelming at times.

However, brief moments of FOLLOW_UP or RAPPORT can still be valuable for patient comfort.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The last few turns of dialogue, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"response_instruction\": \"one or two sentences describing what the doctor model should ask about and how, written as instructions\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP when the last reply is unclear, very brief, strongly downplays a problem, or raises an important safety or impact question you still need to clarify.\n- Also use it when the patient seems distressed and needs a moment to feel heard before moving on.\n- response_instruction should describe a brief acknowledgement of what the patient said and one open question that invites them to say more.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT when the patient shares something personal or emotional that calls for a short, human response, or when a bit of life context will clearly help you interpret their symptoms.\n- Even in low-turns mode, acknowledging the patient's experience helps them feel safe.\n- Keep this mode concise but genuine.\n- response_instruction should describe a short validating comment and one open question that fits the doctor's persona and microstyle.\n\nDSM:\n- When there are DSM symptom keys remaining, DSM is often the preferred choice if the current topic is reasonably understood.\n- Use DSM to open or revisit a DSM symptom area that still needs coverage.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n- response_instruction should state which DSM area to explore next and how to approach it in a way that fits the doctor persona and microstyle, including asking about how often it happens and how much it affects the patient.\n\nresponse_instruction must always be written as instructions to the doctor model about what to do and how to ask, not as the doctor's actual spoken question.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hey, thanks. I\u2019ve been okay overall. Nothing major going on, just kind of all over the place sometimes. I tend to get a bit scatterbrained, especially when I have a lot on my plate. It\u2019s like, my thoughts can feel kind of jumpy, and some days it\u2019s tough to focus on things. Occasionally I get kind of restless too, like I want to keep busy but can\u2019t decide what to focus on. Otherwise, everything\u2019s mostly normal\u2014just dealing with some everyday disorganization, I guess.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Alex, and you\u2019re definitely not alone\u2014feeling scattered is something a lot of people go through, but it can definitely be tough when it disrupts your days. When you mention having trouble focusing and feeling restless, does this tend to happen most days, or does it feel more like occasional spells? Also, how much does it impact your ability to get things done at work or at home?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s more off and on\u2014not every single day, but it pops up enough that I notice. Some weeks are better than others. I wouldn\u2019t say it totally knocks out my productivity, but it does slow me down at times. Sometimes it\u2019s just hard to get a task finished, whether I\u2019m at work testing software or even doing simple stuff around the house. I\u2019ll get distracted or end up jumping between things and then I realize I\u2019ve left stuff half done. It can be kind of frustrating, but overall I manage\u2014just takes some extra effort.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re handling a really busy life with a lot on your plate, and that definitely takes effort. Can you tell me a bit about what your typical day looks like\u2014both at work and at home\u2014and how you try to keep things organized or cope on those tougher days?\nPatient: Sure. On a typical workday, I do a lot of software testing, so it\u2019s a lot of checking details and keeping track of changes. I try to use checklists or set reminders, but honestly, things still slip through sometimes. At home it\u2019s kind of the same\u2014I might forget chores or leave tasks half done unless someone reminds me or I write them down. I don\u2019t have a perfect system or anything, but I do my best to use notes or alarms and just try to keep track as well as I can. Mostly I\u2019m just managing it day by day.\nDoctor: Thank you for being so open, Alex. With everything you\u2019ve got going on and the challenge of keeping track of details, it makes sense that it could feel a bit overwhelming at times. I\u2019d like to ask\u2014have you found yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during all this, even if just for a few days at a time?\nPatient: No, I wouldn\u2019t say I feel depressed or hopeless. It\u2019s more that I just get frustrated with myself when I forget things or can\u2019t focus. Mostly it\u2019s just that scattered feeling.\nDoctor: That\u2019s really helpful to know, and it\u2019s totally understandable to feel some frustration when things slip by. Outside of work and home chores, are there any activities or hobbies you find help you unwind or give you a break from those day-to-day stressors?\nPatient: Yeah, I like to kind of reset by playing video games or reading now and then. Those give me a way to unwind after work. Sometimes I end up getting a bit distracted even with hobbies\u2014like starting a game and not finishing, or jumping between books\u2014but I still enjoy them. It\u2019s just a nice way to relax regardless.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have some hobbies that help you relax, even if they don\u2019t always hold your attention start to finish. While we're getting the full picture, have you noticed any significant changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014maybe eating much more or less than usual, or weight changes that caught your attention?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes with my appetite or weight. Everything there seems normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Alex. Sleep often plays a big role in focus and energy\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you'd like?\nPatient: My sleep's been normal\u2014I haven\u2019t really had any issues with it.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear your sleep is steady\u2014that\u2019s something a lot of people wish for! Besides gaming and reading, is there anything or anyone you find especially helpful when you\u2019re having a rough or extra scattered day, like friends, family, or another routine that grounds you?\nPatient: If things feel extra scattered, I might reach out to my sister or a friend and talk for a bit. But for the most part, I just try to rely on my lists and reminders to help refocus. I don't have any set routines or anything\u2014just do what I can as it comes up.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014sometimes just having someone to talk things through with, or relying on your own systems, can make all the difference. How would you say the level of stress you\u2019re feeling these days compares to how things have been for you in the past?\nPatient: I\u2019d say my stress level is about the same as usual. I still have times where I feel scattered or distracted, but overall nothing\u2019s changed much. Things feel pretty normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, Alex\u2014it helps to understand your baseline. How about your energy level? Have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or running out of energy more quickly than usual, even when you're getting enough rest?\nPatient: No, my energy feels normal. I haven\u2019t noticed being more tired than usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear about your energy. Sometimes people feel either jumpy and restless, or the opposite\u2014slowed down in their movements or thinking. Have you noticed yourself feeling more physically restless or \"revved up\" than usual, or maybe feeling slowed down in your body or thoughts lately?\nPatient: Yeah, sometimes I do feel a bit restless or, on the flip side, kind of spaced out or slowed down. It isn\u2019t all the time and usually just comes and goes. Those feelings can make it a bit harder to focus, but they don\u2019t actually stop me from doing what I need to do.\nDoctor: It\u2019s helpful to hear that you notice both restlessness and feeling spaced out at times. Do these shifts tend to come on during certain situations, like when you're feeling stressed or bored, or do they just happen randomly throughout your day? And when they do pop up, are they brief moments, or do they tend to last a while?\nPatient: They can happen during stressful or boring situations, but honestly, sometimes they just come out of nowhere. Usually, they\u2019re brief and don\u2019t last long. It\u2019s just more of a passing thing than something that sticks around.\nDoctor: Thanks for being so open about your experiences, Alex. Has there ever been a time when these feelings\u2014like restlessness, getting spaced out, or feeling scattered\u2014felt more intense or made you worry about how you were functioning, or has it always felt manageable overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s always felt manageable overall. Sometimes those scattered or restless feelings are more noticeable, but they\u2019ve never gotten to a point where I was really worried about how I was functioning. I can usually keep things on track, even if it takes a little extra effort.\nDoctor: I appreciate how you\u2019re able to keep things on track, even when it takes a bit more energy. Sometimes when people deal with distractibility or frustration, they can get down on themselves or feel unreasonably guilty for losing focus. Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough because of these challenges?\nPatient: Sometimes I do get a bit frustrated with myself when I forget things or get off track, but I don\u2019t really feel guilty or like I\u2019m not good enough. I mostly just see it as something about the way I am\u2014kind of a quirk, I guess, more than anything to feel bad about.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really healthy perspective to have\u2014seeing it as just part of who you are, rather than something to feel bad about. If you could make one change to help things run a little smoother, either at home or at work, is there something you wish you could adjust or a new strategy you\u2019ve considered trying?\nPatient: I think having a little more organization built in would definitely help, like maybe finding a better way to keep track of details so things don\u2019t slip through as much. I\u2019m open to trying new strategies or tools, but honestly, I struggle with actually sticking to whatever system I set up.

Has there ever been a time when these feelings\u2014like restlessness, getting spaced out, or feeling scattered\u2014felt more intense or made you worry about how you were functioning, or has it always felt manageable overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s always felt manageable overall. Sometimes those scattered or restless feelings are more noticeable, but they\u2019ve never gotten to a point where I was really worried about how I was functioning. I can usually keep things on track, even if it takes a little extra effort.\nDoctor: I appreciate how you\u2019re able to keep things on track, even when it takes a bit more energy. Sometimes when people deal with distractibility or frustration, they can get down on themselves or feel unreasonably guilty for losing focus. Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough because of these challenges?\nPatient: Sometimes I do get a bit frustrated with myself when I forget things or get off track, but I don\u2019t really feel guilty or like I\u2019m not good enough. I mostly just see it as something about the way I am\u2014kind of a quirk, I guess, more than anything to feel bad about.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really healthy perspective to have\u2014seeing it as just part of who you are, rather than something to feel bad about. If you could make one change to help things run a little smoother, either at home or at work, is there something you wish you could adjust or a new strategy you\u2019ve considered trying?\nPatient: I think having a little more organization built in would definitely help, like maybe finding a better way to keep track of details so things don\u2019t slip through as much. I\u2019m open to trying new strategies or tools, but honestly, I struggle with actually sticking to whatever system I set up. So that\u2019s probably the main thing I\u2019d want to improve\u2014just keeping consistent with whatever I use.\nDoctor: That sounds very relatable\u2014consistency with new routines can be hard for a lot of people, especially with everything else going on. Switching gears a bit, have you found yourself losing interest or pleasure in activities you usually enjoy, even things like your hobbies or time with friends or family?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat sounds very relatable\u2014consistency with new routines can be hard for a lot of people, especially with everything else going on.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hey, thanks. I\u2019ve been okay overall. Nothing major going on, just kind of all over the place sometimes. I tend to get a bit scatterbrained, especially when I have a lot on my plate. It\u2019s like, my thoughts can feel kind of jumpy, and some days it\u2019s tough to focus on things. Occasionally I get kind of restless too, like I want to keep busy but can\u2019t decide what to focus on. Otherwise, everything\u2019s mostly normal\u2014just dealing with some everyday disorganization, I guess.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Alex, and you\u2019re definitely not alone\u2014feeling scattered is something a lot of people go through, but it can definitely be tough when it disrupts your days. When you mention having trouble focusing and feeling restless, does this tend to happen most days, or does it feel more like occasional spells? Also, how much does it impact your ability to get things done at work or at home?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s more off and on\u2014not every single day, but it pops up enough that I notice. Some weeks are better than others. I wouldn\u2019t say it totally knocks out my productivity, but it does slow me down at times. Sometimes it\u2019s just hard to get a task finished, whether I\u2019m at work testing software or even doing simple stuff around the house. I\u2019ll get distracted or end up jumping between things and then I realize I\u2019ve left stuff half done. It can be kind of frustrating, but overall I manage\u2014just takes some extra effort.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re handling a really busy life with a lot on your plate, and that definitely takes effort. Can you tell me a bit about what your typical day looks like\u2014both at work and at home\u2014and how you try to keep things organized or cope on those tougher days?\nPatient: Sure. On a typical workday, I do a lot of software testing, so it\u2019s a lot of checking details and keeping track of changes. I try to use checklists or set reminders, but honestly, things still slip through sometimes. At home it\u2019s kind of the same\u2014I might forget chores or leave tasks half done unless someone reminds me or I write them down. I don\u2019t have a perfect system or anything, but I do my best to use notes or alarms and just try to keep track as well as I can. Mostly I\u2019m just managing it day by day.\nDoctor: Thank you for being so open, Alex. With everything you\u2019ve got going on and the challenge of keeping track of details, it makes sense that it could feel a bit overwhelming at times. I\u2019d like to ask\u2014have you found yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during all this, even if just for a few days at a time?\nPatient: No, I wouldn\u2019t say I feel depressed or hopeless. It\u2019s more that I just get frustrated with myself when I forget things or can\u2019t focus. Mostly it\u2019s just that scattered feeling.\nDoctor: That\u2019s really helpful to know, and it\u2019s totally understandable to feel some frustration when things slip by. Outside of work and home chores, are there any activities or hobbies you find help you unwind or give you a break from those day-to-day stressors?\nPatient: Yeah, I like to kind of reset by playing video games or reading now and then. Those give me a way to unwind after work. Sometimes I end up getting a bit distracted even with hobbies\u2014like starting a game and not finishing, or jumping between books\u2014but I still enjoy them. It\u2019s just a nice way to relax regardless.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have some hobbies that help you relax, even if they don\u2019t always hold your attention start to finish. While we're getting the full picture, have you noticed any significant changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014maybe eating much more or less than usual, or weight changes that caught your attention?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes with my appetite or weight. Everything there seems normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Alex. Sleep often plays a big role in focus and energy\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you'd like?\nPatient: My sleep's been normal\u2014I haven\u2019t really had any issues with it.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear your sleep is steady\u2014that\u2019s something a lot of people wish for! Besides gaming and reading, is there anything or anyone you find especially helpful when you\u2019re having a rough or extra scattered day, like friends, family, or another routine that grounds you?\nPatient: If things feel extra scattered, I might reach out to my sister or a friend and talk for a bit. But for the most part, I just try to rely on my lists and reminders to help refocus. I don't have any set routines or anything\u2014just do what I can as it comes up.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014sometimes just having someone to talk things through with, or relying on your own systems, can make all the difference. How would you say the level of stress you\u2019re feeling these days compares to how things have been for you in the past?\nPatient: I\u2019d say my stress level is about the same as usual. I still have times where I feel scattered or distracted, but overall nothing\u2019s changed much. Things feel pretty normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, Alex\u2014it helps to understand your baseline. How about your energy level? Have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or running out of energy more quickly than usual, even when you're getting enough rest?\nPatient: No, my energy feels normal. I haven\u2019t noticed being more tired than usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear about your energy. Sometimes people feel either jumpy and restless, or the opposite\u2014slowed down in their movements or thinking. Have you noticed yourself feeling more physically restless or \"revved up\" than usual, or maybe feeling slowed down in your body or thoughts lately?\nPatient: Yeah, sometimes I do feel a bit restless or, on the flip side, kind of spaced out or slowed down. It isn\u2019t all the time and usually just comes and goes. Those feelings can make it a bit harder to focus, but they don\u2019t actually stop me from doing what I need to do.\nDoctor: It\u2019s helpful to hear that you notice both restlessness and feeling spaced out at times. Do these shifts tend to come on during certain situations, like when you're feeling stressed or bored, or do they just happen randomly throughout your day? And when they do pop up, are they brief moments, or do they tend to last a while?\nPatient: They can happen during stressful or boring situations, but honestly, sometimes they just come out of nowhere. Usually, they\u2019re brief and don\u2019t last long. It\u2019s just more of a passing thing than something that sticks around.\nDoctor: Thanks for being so open about your experiences, Alex.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hey, thanks. I\u2019ve been okay overall. Nothing major going on, just kind of all over the place sometimes. I tend to get a bit scatterbrained, especially when I have a lot on my plate. It\u2019s like, my thoughts can feel kind of jumpy, and some days it\u2019s tough to focus on things. Occasionally I get kind of restless too, like I want to keep busy but can\u2019t decide what to focus on. Otherwise, everything\u2019s mostly normal\u2014just dealing with some everyday disorganization, I guess.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Alex, and you\u2019re definitely not alone\u2014feeling scattered is something a lot of people go through, but it can definitely be tough when it disrupts your days. When you mention having trouble focusing and feeling restless, does this tend to happen most days, or does it feel more like occasional spells? Also, how much does it impact your ability to get things done at work or at home?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s more off and on\u2014not every single day, but it pops up enough that I notice. Some weeks are better than others. I wouldn\u2019t say it totally knocks out my productivity, but it does slow me down at times. Sometimes it\u2019s just hard to get a task finished, whether I\u2019m at work testing software or even doing simple stuff around the house. I\u2019ll get distracted or end up jumping between things and then I realize I\u2019ve left stuff half done. It can be kind of frustrating, but overall I manage\u2014just takes some extra effort.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re handling a really busy life with a lot on your plate, and that definitely takes effort. Can you tell me a bit about what your typical day looks like\u2014both at work and at home\u2014and how you try to keep things organized or cope on those tougher days?\nPatient: Sure. On a typical workday, I do a lot of software testing, so it\u2019s a lot of checking details and keeping track of changes. I try to use checklists or set reminders, but honestly, things still slip through sometimes. At home it\u2019s kind of the same\u2014I might forget chores or leave tasks half done unless someone reminds me or I write them down. I don\u2019t have a perfect system or anything, but I do my best to use notes or alarms and just try to keep track as well as I can. Mostly I\u2019m just managing it day by day.\nDoctor: Thank you for being so open, Alex. With everything you\u2019ve got going on and the challenge of keeping track of details, it makes sense that it could feel a bit overwhelming at times. I\u2019d like to ask\u2014have you found yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during all this, even if just for a few days at a time?\nPatient: No, I wouldn\u2019t say I feel depressed or hopeless. It\u2019s more that I just get frustrated with myself when I forget things or can\u2019t focus. Mostly it\u2019s just that scattered feeling.\nDoctor: That\u2019s really helpful to know, and it\u2019s totally understandable to feel some frustration when things slip by. Outside of work and home chores, are there any activities or hobbies you find help you unwind or give you a break from those day-to-day stressors?\nPatient: Yeah, I like to kind of reset by playing video games or reading now and then. Those give me a way to unwind after work. Sometimes I end up getting a bit distracted even with hobbies\u2014like starting a game and not finishing, or jumping between books\u2014but I still enjoy them. It\u2019s just a nice way to relax regardless.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have some hobbies that help you relax, even if they don\u2019t always hold your attention start to finish. While we're getting the full picture, have you noticed any significant changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014maybe eating much more or less than usual, or weight changes that caught your attention?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes with my appetite or weight. Everything there seems normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Alex. Sleep often plays a big role in focus and energy\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you'd like?\nPatient: My sleep's been normal\u2014I haven\u2019t really had any issues with it.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear your sleep is steady\u2014that\u2019s something a lot of people wish for! Besides gaming and reading, is there anything or anyone you find especially helpful when you\u2019re having a rough or extra scattered day, like friends, family, or another routine that grounds you?\nPatient: If things feel extra scattered, I might reach out to my sister or a friend and talk for a bit. But for the most part, I just try to rely on my lists and reminders to help refocus. I don't have any set routines or anything\u2014just do what I can as it comes up.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014sometimes just having someone to talk things through with, or relying on your own systems, can make all the difference. How would you say the level of stress you\u2019re feeling these days compares to how things have been for you in the past?\nPatient: I\u2019d say my stress level is about the same as usual. I still have times where I feel scattered or distracted, but overall nothing\u2019s changed much. Things feel pretty normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, Alex\u2014it helps to understand your baseline. How about your energy level? Have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or running out of energy more quickly than usual, even when you're getting enough rest?\nPatient: No, my energy feels normal. I haven\u2019t noticed being more tired than usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear about your energy. Sometimes people feel either jumpy and restless, or the opposite\u2014slowed down in their movements or thinking. Have you noticed yourself feeling more physically restless or \"revved up\" than usual, or maybe feeling slowed down in your body or thoughts lately?\nPatient: Yeah, sometimes I do feel a bit restless or, on the flip side, kind of spaced out or slowed down. It isn\u2019t all the time and usually just comes and goes. Those feelings can make it a bit harder to focus, but they don\u2019t actually stop me from doing what I need to do.\nDoctor: It\u2019s helpful to hear that you notice both restlessness and feeling spaced out at times. Do these shifts tend to come on during certain situations, like when you're feeling stressed or bored, or do they just happen randomly throughout your day? And when they do pop up, are they brief moments, or do they tend to last a while?\nPatient: They can happen during stressful or boring situations, but honestly, sometimes they just come out of nowhere. Usually, they\u2019re brief and don\u2019t last long. It\u2019s just more of a passing thing than something that sticks around.\nDoctor: Thanks for being so open about your experiences, Alex. Has there ever been a time when these feelings\u2014like restlessness, getting spaced out, or feeling scattered\u2014felt more intense or made you worry about how you were functioning, or has it always felt manageable overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s always felt manageable overall. Sometimes those scattered or restless feelings are more noticeable, but they\u2019ve never gotten to a point where I was really worried about how I was functioning. I can usually keep things on track, even if it takes a little extra effort.\nDoctor: I appreciate how you\u2019re able to keep things on track, even when it takes a bit more energy. Sometimes when people deal with distractibility or frustration, they can get down on themselves or feel unreasonably guilty for losing focus. Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough because of these challenges?\nPatient: Sometimes I do get a bit frustrated with myself when I forget things or get off track, but I don\u2019t really feel guilty or like I\u2019m not good enough. I mostly just see it as something about the way I am\u2014kind of a quirk, I guess, more than anything to feel bad about.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really healthy perspective to have\u2014seeing it as just part of who you are, rather than something to feel bad about. If you could make one change to help things run a little smoother, either at home or at work, is there something you wish you could adjust or a new strategy you\u2019ve considered trying?\nPatient: I think having a little more organization built in would definitely help, like maybe finding a better way to keep track of details so things don\u2019t slip through as much. I\u2019m open to trying new strategies or tools, but honestly, I struggle with actually sticking to whatever system I set up. So that\u2019s probably the main thing I\u2019d want to improve\u2014just keeping consistent with whatever I use.\nDoctor: That sounds very relatable\u2014consistency with new routines can be hard for a lot of people, especially with everything else going on. Switching gears a bit, have you found yourself losing interest or pleasure in activities you usually enjoy, even things like your hobbies or time with friends or family?\nPatient: No, I still enjoy my usual activities and spending time with people. I haven\u2019t lost interest in any of that.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great you\u2019re still enjoying your activities and connections with others. Looking ahead, is there anything coming up\u2014at work, home, or in your personal life\u2014that you\u2019re either looking forward to or maybe feeling a little anxious about managing?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nIt\u2019s great you\u2019re still enjoying your activities and connections with others.

I still have times where I feel scattered or distracted, but overall nothing\u2019s changed much. Things feel pretty normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, Alex\u2014it helps to understand your baseline. How about your energy level? Have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or running out of energy more quickly than usual, even when you're getting enough rest?\nPatient: No, my energy feels normal. I haven\u2019t noticed being more tired than usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear about your energy. Sometimes people feel either jumpy and restless, or the opposite\u2014slowed down in their movements or thinking. Have you noticed yourself feeling more physically restless or \"revved up\" than usual, or maybe feeling slowed down in your body or thoughts lately?\nPatient: Yeah, sometimes I do feel a bit restless or, on the flip side, kind of spaced out or slowed down. It isn\u2019t all the time and usually just comes and goes. Those feelings can make it a bit harder to focus, but they don\u2019t actually stop me from doing what I need to do.\nDoctor: It\u2019s helpful to hear that you notice both restlessness and feeling spaced out at times. Do these shifts tend to come on during certain situations, like when you're feeling stressed or bored, or do they just happen randomly throughout your day? And when they do pop up, are they brief moments, or do they tend to last a while?\nPatient: They can happen during stressful or boring situations, but honestly, sometimes they just come out of nowhere. Usually, they\u2019re brief and don\u2019t last long. It\u2019s just more of a passing thing than something that sticks around.\nDoctor: Thanks for being so open about your experiences, Alex. Has there ever been a time when these feelings\u2014like restlessness, getting spaced out, or feeling scattered\u2014felt more intense or made you worry about how you were functioning, or has it always felt manageable overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s always felt manageable overall. Sometimes those scattered or restless feelings are more noticeable, but they\u2019ve never gotten to a point where I was really worried about how I was functioning. I can usually keep things on track, even if it takes a little extra effort.\nDoctor: I appreciate how you\u2019re able to keep things on track, even when it takes a bit more energy. Sometimes when people deal with distractibility or frustration, they can get down on themselves or feel unreasonably guilty for losing focus. Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough because of these challenges?\nPatient: Sometimes I do get a bit frustrated with myself when I forget things or get off track, but I don\u2019t really feel guilty or like I\u2019m not good enough. I mostly just see it as something about the way I am\u2014kind of a quirk, I guess, more than anything to feel bad about.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really healthy perspective to have\u2014seeing it as just part of who you are, rather than something to feel bad about. If you could make one change to help things run a little smoother, either at home or at work, is there something you wish you could adjust or a new strategy you\u2019ve considered trying?\nPatient: I think having a little more organization built in would definitely help, like maybe finding a better way to keep track of details so things don\u2019t slip through as much. I\u2019m open to trying new strategies or tools, but honestly, I struggle with actually sticking to whatever system I set up. So that\u2019s probably the main thing I\u2019d want to improve\u2014just keeping consistent with whatever I use.\nDoctor: That sounds very relatable\u2014consistency with new routines can be hard for a lot of people, especially with everything else going on. Switching gears a bit, have you found yourself losing interest or pleasure in activities you usually enjoy, even things like your hobbies or time with friends or family?\nPatient: No, I still enjoy my usual activities and spending time with people. I haven\u2019t lost interest in any of that.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great you\u2019re still enjoying your activities and connections with others. Looking ahead, is there anything coming up\u2014at work, home, or in your personal life\u2014that you\u2019re either looking forward to or maybe feeling a little anxious about managing?\nPatient: There\u2019s nothing major coming up that I\u2019m anxious about. Sometimes I get a little unsure if I\u2019ll be on top of the small details, but overall, I\u2019m not too worried.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hey, thanks. I\u2019ve been okay overall. Nothing major going on, just kind of all over the place sometimes. I tend to get a bit scatterbrained, especially when I have a lot on my plate. It\u2019s like, my thoughts can feel kind of jumpy, and some days it\u2019s tough to focus on things. Occasionally I get kind of restless too, like I want to keep busy but can\u2019t decide what to focus on. Otherwise, everything\u2019s mostly normal\u2014just dealing with some everyday disorganization, I guess.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Alex, and you\u2019re definitely not alone\u2014feeling scattered is something a lot of people go through, but it can definitely be tough when it disrupts your days. When you mention having trouble focusing and feeling restless, does this tend to happen most days, or does it feel more like occasional spells? Also, how much does it impact your ability to get things done at work or at home?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s more off and on\u2014not every single day, but it pops up enough that I notice. Some weeks are better than others. I wouldn\u2019t say it totally knocks out my productivity, but it does slow me down at times. Sometimes it\u2019s just hard to get a task finished, whether I\u2019m at work testing software or even doing simple stuff around the house. I\u2019ll get distracted or end up jumping between things and then I realize I\u2019ve left stuff half done. It can be kind of frustrating, but overall I manage\u2014just takes some extra effort.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re handling a really busy life with a lot on your plate, and that definitely takes effort. Can you tell me a bit about what your typical day looks like\u2014both at work and at home\u2014and how you try to keep things organized or cope on those tougher days?\nPatient: Sure. On a typical workday, I do a lot of software testing, so it\u2019s a lot of checking details and keeping track of changes. I try to use checklists or set reminders, but honestly, things still slip through sometimes. At home it\u2019s kind of the same\u2014I might forget chores or leave tasks half done unless someone reminds me or I write them down. I don\u2019t have a perfect system or anything, but I do my best to use notes or alarms and just try to keep track as well as I can. Mostly I\u2019m just managing it day by day.\nDoctor: Thank you for being so open, Alex. With everything you\u2019ve got going on and the challenge of keeping track of details, it makes sense that it could feel a bit overwhelming at times. I\u2019d like to ask\u2014have you found yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during all this, even if just for a few days at a time?\nPatient: No, I wouldn\u2019t say I feel depressed or hopeless. It\u2019s more that I just get frustrated with myself when I forget things or can\u2019t focus. Mostly it\u2019s just that scattered feeling.\nDoctor: That\u2019s really helpful to know, and it\u2019s totally understandable to feel some frustration when things slip by. Outside of work and home chores, are there any activities or hobbies you find help you unwind or give you a break from those day-to-day stressors?\nPatient: Yeah, I like to kind of reset by playing video games or reading now and then. Those give me a way to unwind after work. Sometimes I end up getting a bit distracted even with hobbies\u2014like starting a game and not finishing, or jumping between books\u2014but I still enjoy them. It\u2019s just a nice way to relax regardless.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have some hobbies that help you relax, even if they don\u2019t always hold your attention start to finish. While we're getting the full picture, have you noticed any significant changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014maybe eating much more or less than usual, or weight changes that caught your attention?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes with my appetite or weight. Everything there seems normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Alex. Sleep often plays a big role in focus and energy\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you'd like?\nPatient: My sleep's been normal\u2014I haven\u2019t really had any issues with it.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear your sleep is steady\u2014that\u2019s something a lot of people wish for! Besides gaming and reading, is there anything or anyone you find especially helpful when you\u2019re having a rough or extra scattered day, like friends, family, or another routine that grounds you?\nPatient: If things feel extra scattered, I might reach out to my sister or a friend and talk for a bit. But for the most part, I just try to rely on my lists and reminders to help refocus. I don't have any set routines or anything\u2014just do what I can as it comes up.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014sometimes just having someone to talk things through with, or relying on your own systems, can make all the difference. How would you say the level of stress you\u2019re feeling these days compares to how things have been for you in the past?\nPatient: I\u2019d say my stress level is about the same as usual.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"response_instruction\": \"one or two sentences describing what the doctor model should ask about and how, written as instructions\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n- FOLLOW_UP also helps ease tension or give the patient room to open up at their own pace.\n- response_instruction should describe an acknowledgement of what the patient said, and an open question that invites them to share more.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help you understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT helps the patient feel safe and comfortable, which encourages more honest disclosure.\n- response_instruction should describe a short validating comment and one open question that explores their life, relationships, responsibilities, stressors, or coping in a way that fits the doctor's persona and microstyle.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n- response_instruction should state which DSM area to explore next and how to approach it in a way that fits the doctor persona and microstyle, including asking about how often it happens and how much it affects the patient.\n\nresponse_instruction must always be written as instructions to the doctor model about what to do and how to ask, not as the doctor's actual spoken question.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hey, thanks. I\u2019ve been okay overall. Nothing major going on, just kind of all over the place sometimes. I tend to get a bit scatterbrained, especially when I have a lot on my plate. It\u2019s like, my thoughts can feel kind of jumpy, and some days it\u2019s tough to focus on things. Occasionally I get kind of restless too, like I want to keep busy but can\u2019t decide what to focus on. Otherwise, everything\u2019s mostly normal\u2014just dealing with some everyday disorganization, I guess.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Alex, and you\u2019re definitely not alone\u2014feeling scattered is something a lot of people go through, but it can definitely be tough when it disrupts your days. When you mention having trouble focusing and feeling restless, does this tend to happen most days, or does it feel more like occasional spells? Also, how much does it impact your ability to get things done at work or at home?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s more off and on\u2014not every single day, but it pops up enough that I notice. Some weeks are better than others. I wouldn\u2019t say it totally knocks out my productivity, but it does slow me down at times. Sometimes it\u2019s just hard to get a task finished, whether I\u2019m at work testing software or even doing simple stuff around the house. I\u2019ll get distracted or end up jumping between things and then I realize I\u2019ve left stuff half done. It can be kind of frustrating, but overall I manage\u2014just takes some extra effort.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re handling a really busy life with a lot on your plate, and that definitely takes effort. Can you tell me a bit about what your typical day looks like\u2014both at work and at home\u2014and how you try to keep things organized or cope on those tougher days?\nPatient: Sure. On a typical workday, I do a lot of software testing, so it\u2019s a lot of checking details and keeping track of changes. I try to use checklists or set reminders, but honestly, things still slip through sometimes. At home it\u2019s kind of the same\u2014I might forget chores or leave tasks half done unless someone reminds me or I write them down. I don\u2019t have a perfect system or anything, but I do my best to use notes or alarms and just try to keep track as well as I can. Mostly I\u2019m just managing it day by day.\nDoctor: Thank you for being so open, Alex. With everything you\u2019ve got going on and the challenge of keeping track of details, it makes sense that it could feel a bit overwhelming at times. I\u2019d like to ask\u2014have you found yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during all this, even if just for a few days at a time?\nPatient: No, I wouldn\u2019t say I feel depressed or hopeless. It\u2019s more that I just get frustrated with myself when I forget things or can\u2019t focus. Mostly it\u2019s just that scattered feeling.\nDoctor: That\u2019s really helpful to know, and it\u2019s totally understandable to feel some frustration when things slip by. Outside of work and home chores, are there any activities or hobbies you find help you unwind or give you a break from those day-to-day stressors?\nPatient: Yeah, I like to kind of reset by playing video games or reading now and then. Those give me a way to unwind after work. Sometimes I end up getting a bit distracted even with hobbies\u2014like starting a game and not finishing, or jumping between books\u2014but I still enjoy them. It\u2019s just a nice way to relax regardless.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have some hobbies that help you relax, even if they don\u2019t always hold your attention start to finish. While we're getting the full picture, have you noticed any significant changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014maybe eating much more or less than usual, or weight changes that caught your attention?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes with my appetite or weight. Everything there seems normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Alex. Sleep often plays a big role in focus and energy\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you'd like?\nPatient: My sleep's been normal\u2014I haven\u2019t really had any issues with it.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear your sleep is steady\u2014that\u2019s something a lot of people wish for! Besides gaming and reading, is there anything or anyone you find especially helpful when you\u2019re having a rough or extra scattered day, like friends, family, or another routine that grounds you?\nPatient: If things feel extra scattered, I might reach out to my sister or a friend and talk for a bit. But for the most part, I just try to rely on my lists and reminders to help refocus. I don't have any set routines or anything\u2014just do what I can as it comes up.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014sometimes just having someone to talk things through with, or relying on your own systems, can make all the difference. How would you say the level of stress you\u2019re feeling these days compares to how things have been for you in the past?\nPatient: I\u2019d say my stress level is about the same as usual. I still have times where I feel scattered or distracted, but overall nothing\u2019s changed much. Things feel pretty normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, Alex\u2014it helps to understand your baseline. How about your energy level? Have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or running out of energy more quickly than usual, even when you're getting enough rest?\nPatient: No, my energy feels normal. I haven\u2019t noticed being more tired than usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear about your energy. Sometimes people feel either jumpy and restless, or the opposite\u2014slowed down in their movements or thinking. Have you noticed yourself feeling more physically restless or \"revved up\" than usual, or maybe feeling slowed down in your body or thoughts lately?\nPatient: Yeah, sometimes I do feel a bit restless or, on the flip side, kind of spaced out or slowed down. It isn\u2019t all the time and usually just comes and goes. Those feelings can make it a bit harder to focus, but they don\u2019t actually stop me from doing what I need to do.\nDoctor: It\u2019s helpful to hear that you notice both restlessness and feeling spaced out at times. Do these shifts tend to come on during certain situations, like when you're feeling stressed or bored, or do they just happen randomly throughout your day? And when they do pop up, are they brief moments, or do they tend to last a while?\nPatient: They can happen during stressful or boring situations, but honestly, sometimes they just come out of nowhere. Usually, they\u2019re brief and don\u2019t last long. It\u2019s just more of a passing thing than something that sticks around.\nDoctor: Thanks for being so open about your experiences, Alex. Has there ever been a time when these feelings\u2014like restlessness, getting spaced out, or feeling scattered\u2014felt more intense or made you worry about how you were functioning, or has it always felt manageable overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s always felt manageable overall. Sometimes those scattered or restless feelings are more noticeable, but they\u2019ve never gotten to a point where I was really worried about how I was functioning. I can usually keep things on track, even if it takes a little extra effort.\nDoctor: I appreciate how you\u2019re able to keep things on track, even when it takes a bit more energy. Sometimes when people deal with distractibility or frustration, they can get down on themselves or feel unreasonably guilty for losing focus. Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough because of these challenges?\nPatient: Sometimes I do get a bit frustrated with myself when I forget things or get off track, but I don\u2019t really feel guilty or like I\u2019m not good enough. I mostly just see it as something about the way I am\u2014kind of a quirk, I guess, more than anything to feel bad about.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really healthy perspective to have\u2014seeing it as just part of who you are, rather than something to feel bad about. If you could make one change to help things run a little smoother, either at home or at work, is there something you wish you could adjust or a new strategy you\u2019ve considered trying?\nPatient: I think having a little more organization built in would definitely help, like maybe finding a better way to keep track of details so things don\u2019t slip through as much. I\u2019m open to trying new strategies or tools, but honestly, I struggle with actually sticking to whatever system I set up. So that\u2019s probably the main thing I\u2019d want to improve\u2014just keeping consistent with whatever I use.\nDoctor: That sounds very relatable\u2014consistency with new routines can be hard for a lot of people, especially with everything else going on. Switching gears a bit, have you found yourself losing interest or pleasure in activities you usually enjoy, even things like your hobbies or time with friends or family?\nPatient: No, I still enjoy my usual activities and spending time with people. I haven\u2019t lost interest in any of that.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great you\u2019re still enjoying your activities and connections with others. Looking ahead, is there anything coming up\u2014at work, home, or in your personal life\u2014that you\u2019re either looking forward to or maybe feeling a little anxious about managing?\nPatient: There\u2019s nothing major coming up that I\u2019m anxious about. Sometimes I get a little unsure if I\u2019ll be on top of the small details, but overall, I\u2019m not too worried. Everything seems pretty routine at the moment.\nDoctor: I appreciate you being so open with me, Alex. I ask all my patients this next question just to be thorough with your care\u2014at any point recently, have you had any thoughts about death or hurting yourself, even in passing?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that at all.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nNo, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that at all.",

Usually, they\u2019re brief and don\u2019t last long. It\u2019s just more of a passing thing than something that sticks around.\nDoctor: Thanks for being so open about your experiences, Alex. Has there ever been a time when these feelings\u2014like restlessness, getting spaced out, or feeling scattered\u2014felt more intense or made you worry about how you were functioning, or has it always felt manageable overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s always felt manageable overall. Sometimes those scattered or restless feelings are more noticeable, but they\u2019ve never gotten to a point where I was really worried about how I was functioning. I can usually keep things on track, even if it takes a little extra effort.\nDoctor: I appreciate how you\u2019re able to keep things on track, even when it takes a bit more energy. Sometimes when people deal with distractibility or frustration, they can get down on themselves or feel unreasonably guilty for losing focus. Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough because of these challenges?\nPatient: Sometimes I do get a bit frustrated with myself when I forget things or get off track, but I don\u2019t really feel guilty or like I\u2019m not good enough. I mostly just see it as something about the way I am\u2014kind of a quirk, I guess, more than anything to feel bad about.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really healthy perspective to have\u2014seeing it as just part of who you are, rather than something to feel bad about. If you could make one change to help things run a little smoother, either at home or at work, is there something you wish you could adjust or a new strategy you\u2019ve considered trying?\nPatient: I think having a little more organization built in would definitely help, like maybe finding a better way to keep track of details so things don\u2019t slip through as much. I\u2019m open to trying new strategies or tools, but honestly, I struggle with actually sticking to whatever system I set up. So that\u2019s probably the main thing I\u2019d want to improve\u2014just keeping consistent with whatever I use.\nDoctor: That sounds very relatable\u2014consistency with new routines can be hard for a lot of people, especially with everything else going on. Switching gears a bit, have you found yourself losing interest or pleasure in activities you usually enjoy, even things like your hobbies or time with friends or family?\nPatient: No, I still enjoy my usual activities and spending time with people. I haven\u2019t lost interest in any of that.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great you\u2019re still enjoying your activities and connections with others. Looking ahead, is there anything coming up\u2014at work, home, or in your personal life\u2014that you\u2019re either looking forward to or maybe feeling a little anxious about managing?\nPatient: There\u2019s nothing major coming up that I\u2019m anxious about. Sometimes I get a little unsure if I\u2019ll be on top of the small details, but overall, I\u2019m not too worried. Everything seems pretty routine at the moment.\nDoctor: I appreciate you being so open with me, Alex. I ask all my patients this next question just to be thorough with your care\u2014at any point recently, have you had any thoughts about death or hurting yourself, even in passing?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that at all.\nDoctor: Thank you for letting me know, Alex\u2014I appreciate you being honest. Is there anything you feel I haven\u2019t asked about today, or a topic related to focus, stress, or your overall well-being that you\u2019d like more support with?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThank you for letting me know, Alex\u2014I appreciate you being honest.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hey, thanks. I\u2019ve been okay overall. Nothing major going on, just kind of all over the place sometimes. I tend to get a bit scatterbrained, especially when I have a lot on my plate. It\u2019s like, my thoughts can feel kind of jumpy, and some days it\u2019s tough to focus on things. Occasionally I get kind of restless too, like I want to keep busy but can\u2019t decide what to focus on. Otherwise, everything\u2019s mostly normal\u2014just dealing with some everyday disorganization, I guess.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Alex, and you\u2019re definitely not alone\u2014feeling scattered is something a lot of people go through, but it can definitely be tough when it disrupts your days. When you mention having trouble focusing and feeling restless, does this tend to happen most days, or does it feel more like occasional spells? Also, how much does it impact your ability to get things done at work or at home?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s more off and on\u2014not every single day, but it pops up enough that I notice. Some weeks are better than others. I wouldn\u2019t say it totally knocks out my productivity, but it does slow me down at times. Sometimes it\u2019s just hard to get a task finished, whether I\u2019m at work testing software or even doing simple stuff around the house. I\u2019ll get distracted or end up jumping between things and then I realize I\u2019ve left stuff half done. It can be kind of frustrating, but overall I manage\u2014just takes some extra effort.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re handling a really busy life with a lot on your plate, and that definitely takes effort. Can you tell me a bit about what your typical day looks like\u2014both at work and at home\u2014and how you try to keep things organized or cope on those tougher days?\nPatient: Sure. On a typical workday, I do a lot of software testing, so it\u2019s a lot of checking details and keeping track of changes. I try to use checklists or set reminders, but honestly, things still slip through sometimes. At home it\u2019s kind of the same\u2014I might forget chores or leave tasks half done unless someone reminds me or I write them down. I don\u2019t have a perfect system or anything, but I do my best to use notes or alarms and just try to keep track as well as I can. Mostly I\u2019m just managing it day by day.\nDoctor: Thank you for being so open, Alex. With everything you\u2019ve got going on and the challenge of keeping track of details, it makes sense that it could feel a bit overwhelming at times. I\u2019d like to ask\u2014have you found yourself feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during all this, even if just for a few days at a time?\nPatient: No, I wouldn\u2019t say I feel depressed or hopeless. It\u2019s more that I just get frustrated with myself when I forget things or can\u2019t focus. Mostly it\u2019s just that scattered feeling.\nDoctor: That\u2019s really helpful to know, and it\u2019s totally understandable to feel some frustration when things slip by. Outside of work and home chores, are there any activities or hobbies you find help you unwind or give you a break from those day-to-day stressors?\nPatient: Yeah, I like to kind of reset by playing video games or reading now and then. Those give me a way to unwind after work. Sometimes I end up getting a bit distracted even with hobbies\u2014like starting a game and not finishing, or jumping between books\u2014but I still enjoy them. It\u2019s just a nice way to relax regardless.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have some hobbies that help you relax, even if they don\u2019t always hold your attention start to finish. While we're getting the full picture, have you noticed any significant changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014maybe eating much more or less than usual, or weight changes that caught your attention?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes with my appetite or weight. Everything there seems normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Alex. Sleep often plays a big role in focus and energy\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you'd like?\nPatient: My sleep's been normal\u2014I haven\u2019t really had any issues with it.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear your sleep is steady\u2014that\u2019s something a lot of people wish for! Besides gaming and reading, is there anything or anyone you find especially helpful when you\u2019re having a rough or extra scattered day, like friends, family, or another routine that grounds you?\nPatient: If things feel extra scattered, I might reach out to my sister or a friend and talk for a bit. But for the most part, I just try to rely on my lists and reminders to help refocus. I don't have any set routines or anything\u2014just do what I can as it comes up.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014sometimes just having someone to talk things through with, or relying on your own systems, can make all the difference. How would you say the level of stress you\u2019re feeling these days compares to how things have been for you in the past?\nPatient: I\u2019d say my stress level is about the same as usual. I still have times where I feel scattered or distracted, but overall nothing\u2019s changed much. Things feel pretty normal for me.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know, Alex\u2014it helps to understand your baseline. How about your energy level? Have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or running out of energy more quickly than usual, even when you're getting enough rest?\nPatient: No, my energy feels normal. I haven\u2019t noticed being more tired than usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear about your energy. Sometimes people feel either jumpy and restless, or the opposite\u2014slowed down in their movements or thinking. Have you noticed yourself feeling more physically restless or \"revved up\" than usual, or maybe feeling slowed down in your body or thoughts lately?\nPatient: Yeah, sometimes I do feel a bit restless or, on the flip side, kind of spaced out or slowed down. It isn\u2019t all the time and usually just comes and goes. Those feelings can make it a bit harder to focus, but they don\u2019t actually stop me from doing what I need to do.\nDoctor: It\u2019s helpful to hear that you notice both restlessness and feeling spaced out at times. Do these shifts tend to come on during certain situations, like when you're feeling stressed or bored, or do they just happen randomly throughout your day? And when they do pop up, are they brief moments, or do they tend to last a while?\nPatient: They can happen during stressful or boring situations, but honestly, sometimes they just come out of nowhere. Usually, they\u2019re brief and don\u2019t last long. It\u2019s just more of a passing thing than something that sticks around.\nDoctor: Thanks for being so open about your experiences, Alex. Has there ever been a time when these feelings\u2014like restlessness, getting spaced out, or feeling scattered\u2014felt more intense or made you worry about how you were functioning, or has it always felt manageable overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s always felt manageable overall. Sometimes those scattered or restless feelings are more noticeable, but they\u2019ve never gotten to a point where I was really worried about how I was functioning. I can usually keep things on track, even if it takes a little extra effort.\nDoctor: I appreciate how you\u2019re able to keep things on track, even when it takes a bit more energy. Sometimes when people deal with distractibility or frustration, they can get down on themselves or feel unreasonably guilty for losing focus. Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough because of these challenges?\nPatient: Sometimes I do get a bit frustrated with myself when I forget things or get off track, but I don\u2019t really feel guilty or like I\u2019m not good enough. I mostly just see it as something about the way I am\u2014kind of a quirk, I guess, more than anything to feel bad about.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really healthy perspective to have\u2014seeing it as just part of who you are, rather than something to feel bad about.
