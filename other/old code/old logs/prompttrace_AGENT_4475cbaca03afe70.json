When work does start to feel harder, how often would you say that happens? Is it more of a rare thing, or is it becoming more frequent lately?\nPatient: It happens sometimes, but not very often.

Occasionally it touches other areas, but not much.\nDoctor: When it does impact other areas outside of work, like your home life or social life, what kind of stuff do you notice changing?\nPatient: Sometimes I\u2019m a bit more tired or less engaged at home or socially, but nothing major.\nDoctor: Thanks for being honest about that. When you feel more tired or less engaged, does it tend to last for a while, or do you bounce back pretty quickly?\nPatient: It usually doesn\u2019t last long. I bounce back fairly quickly.\nDoctor: Alright, thanks for sticking with me as we go through these. Over the past couple of weeks, have you found yourself feeling down, sad, or hopeless more than usual?\nPatient: Not really. I rarely feel that way.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear. Just to be clear, when you say \u201crarely,\u201d is it more like once in a while for a short time, or almost never at all?\nPatient: Once in a while for a short time. It\u2019s pretty rare.\nDoctor: When those rare moments of feeling down do happen, is there usually something specific that triggers it, or does it seem to come out of the blue?\nPatient: There\u2019s usually a reason, like stress or something not going as planned. It doesn\u2019t come out of the blue.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. When stress or changes throw you off, are you able to get back to your usual mood easily, or does it sometimes take a while to feel like yourself again?\nPatient: I usually get back to normal pretty quickly. It\u2019s rare that it takes longer.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any trouble enjoying things you usually like to do\u2014like hobbies, seeing friends, or activities outside of work\u2014in the past couple of weeks?\nPatient: No real trouble. I still do my usual activities. Sometimes I\u2019m a bit less engaged, but it\u2019s not a major issue.\nDoctor: When you do feel a bit less engaged with your activities, does it tend to affect everything you do, or just specific things\u2014like certain hobbies or hanging out with particular people?\nPatient: Just specific things occasionally. It doesn\u2019t affect everything and isn\u2019t a major problem.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any big changes in your appetite or weight recently, even when you haven\u2019t been trying to make a change?\nPatient: There have been some changes in my appetite and a bit of a difference in my weight, but nothing extreme. It\u2019s not intentional\u2014just sometimes happens when I\u2019m stressed or particularly busy.\nDoctor: How have you been sleeping lately? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping a lot more or less than usual?\nPatient: I\u2019ve had some trouble with sleep, mostly when things are stressful or I\u2019m very busy. It\u2019s not extreme.\nDoctor: In the past couple of weeks, have you found yourself feeling really down on yourself, overly guilty about things, or feeling worthless\u2014even a little more than you normally might?\nPatient: I do sometimes feel overly guilty or a bit down on myself, especially if things aren\u2019t going as planned. It\u2019s not constant, but it does happen occasionally.\nDoctor: Lately, have you noticed any trouble focusing, making decisions, or thinking clearly\u2014more than you usually would?\nPatient: Rarely. It only happens occasionally if I\u2019m stressed, but it\u2019s not a big issue.\nDoctor: Have you noticed feeling unusually restless or, on the flip side, moving or speaking more slowly than usual\u2014enough that other people might notice?\nPatient: Rarely.

I\u2019ve mainly been focused on work and staying on top of things.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014so when you say you\u2019ve been focused on work, are there days when it feels especially tough to keep up, or is it more of a steady thing lately?\nPatient: Sometimes work does feel harder, but I generally manage to keep up with my responsibilities.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. When work does start to feel harder, how often would you say that happens? Is it more of a rare thing, or is it becoming more frequent lately?\nPatient: It happens sometimes, but not very often. I\u2019m still able to manage what needs to get done.\nDoctor: Okay, that's helpful to know. When it does feel tougher to manage, does it spill over into other areas of your life, like home or social stuff, or does it mostly just affect work?\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly just work. Occasionally it touches other areas, but not much.\nDoctor: When it does impact other areas outside of work, like your home life or social life, what kind of stuff do you notice changing?\nPatient: Sometimes I\u2019m a bit more tired or less engaged at home or socially, but nothing major.\nDoctor: Thanks for being honest about that. When you feel more tired or less engaged, does it tend to last for a while, or do you bounce back pretty quickly?\nPatient: It usually doesn\u2019t last long. I bounce back fairly quickly.\nDoctor: Alright, thanks for sticking with me as we go through these. Over the past couple of weeks, have you found yourself feeling down, sad, or hopeless more than usual?\nPatient: Not really. I rarely feel that way.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear. Just to be clear, when you say \u201crarely,\u201d is it more like once in a while for a short time, or almost never at all?\nPatient: Once in a while for a short time. It\u2019s pretty rare.\nDoctor: When those rare moments of feeling down do happen, is there usually something specific that triggers it, or does it seem to come out of the blue?\nPatient: There\u2019s usually a reason, like stress or something not going as planned. It doesn\u2019t come out of the blue.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. When stress or changes throw you off, are you able to get back to your usual mood easily, or does it sometimes take a while to feel like yourself again?\nPatient: I usually get back to normal pretty quickly. It\u2019s rare that it takes longer.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any trouble enjoying things you usually like to do\u2014like hobbies, seeing friends, or activities outside of work\u2014in the past couple of weeks?\nPatient: No real trouble. I still do my usual activities. Sometimes I\u2019m a bit less engaged, but it\u2019s not a major issue.\nDoctor: When you do feel a bit less engaged with your activities, does it tend to affect everything you do, or just specific things\u2014like certain hobbies or hanging out with particular people?\nPatient: Just specific things occasionally. It doesn\u2019t affect everything and isn\u2019t a major problem.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any big changes in your appetite or weight recently, even when you haven\u2019t been trying to make a change?\nPatient: There have been some changes in my appetite and a bit of a difference in my weight, but nothing extreme. It\u2019s not intentional\u2014just sometimes happens when I\u2019m stressed or particularly busy.\nDoctor: How have you been sleeping lately? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping a lot more or less than usual?\nPatient: I\u2019ve had some trouble with sleep, mostly when things are stressful or I\u2019m very busy. It\u2019s not extreme.\nDoctor: In the past couple of weeks, have you found yourself feeling really down on yourself, overly guilty about things, or feeling worthless\u2014even a little more than you normally might?\nPatient: I do sometimes feel overly guilty or a bit down on myself, especially if things aren\u2019t going as planned. It\u2019s not constant, but it does happen occasionally.\nDoctor: Lately, have you noticed any trouble focusing, making decisions, or thinking clearly\u2014more than you usually would?\nPatient: Rarely. It only happens occasionally if I\u2019m stressed, but it\u2019s not a big issue.\nDoctor: Have you noticed feeling unusually restless or, on the flip side, moving or speaking more slowly than usual\u2014enough that other people might notice?\nPatient: Rarely. It\u2019s not something other people would notice.\nDoctor: Have you been feeling especially tired or like you just don\u2019t have as much energy as usual over the past couple of weeks?\nPatient: I occasionally feel a bit tired, but it\u2019s not a major issue. I still get things done.\nDoctor: In the past couple of weeks, have you had any thoughts about death, or found yourself thinking that you\u2019d be better off not here\u2014even if those thoughts are just passing or not really serious?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nIn the past couple of weeks, have you had any thoughts about death, or found yourself thinking that you\u2019d be better off not here\u2014even if those thoughts are just passing or not really serious?\n\nTask:\nDecide how the patient should respond next and output JSON only.",
