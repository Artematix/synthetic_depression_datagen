It\u2019s more like running slightly uphill\u2014still moving, just takes a bit more effort than before.

Nothing major or new for me, though.\nDoctor: All right, let's just ask it flat\u2014do you feel down or blue most of the day, more days than not? And when this happens, how heavy does it hit you compared to your usual baseline?\nPatient: It\u2019s there most days\u2014a muted shadow in the background.

It\u2019s more like running slightly uphill\u2014still moving, just takes a bit more effort than before.

Nothing major or new for me, though.\nDoctor: All right, let's just ask it flat\u2014do you feel down or blue most of the day, more days than not?

And, does it stop you from doing what you need to do around the house or for yourself?\nPatient: It\u2019s there most days\u2014not always thick, but enough to notice. Sometimes the simple things feel heavier, like moving against a slow current, but for the most part, I still keep things running.\nDoctor: And when you do push through and manage those daily tasks, do you ever feel even a moment of relief or satisfaction, or is it mostly just work, no real feeling tied to it?\nPatient: Mostly just work, to be honest. Getting things done feels a bit like checking boxes on a list\u2014they\u2019re done, but it rarely means much.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any major changes in your eating habits, appetite, or weight lately? Either eating way more, barely eating, or anything else unusual for you?\nPatient: Nothing significant. Maybe off by a bit here or there, but nothing that stands out.\nDoctor: How about sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping more than usual? Anything different there?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s about the same as it\u2019s always been. That part hasn\u2019t shifted\u2014still a predictable rhythm, night after night.\nDoctor: Okay, when you say predictable\u2014are you actually feeling rested when you wake up, or is it just that you\u2019re getting the same amount of hours, whether it\u2019s restful or not?\nPatient: It\u2019s routine, really. I sleep and wake up as usual, and restfulness doesn\u2019t feel any different than before. No real shifts there.\nDoctor: Are you dragging through the day with less energy, or maybe just more tired than you\u2019d expect, even if you\u2019re sleeping decently? Or are energy levels steady compared to before?\nPatient: A little less energy, but nothing drastic. It\u2019s more like running slightly uphill\u2014still moving, just takes a bit more effort than before. But I manage.\nDoctor: Ever catch yourself thinking you\u2019re not doing enough, or ruminating about things being your fault, even if it isn\u2019t logical? Guilt or self-criticism sharper lately, or business as usual there?\nPatient: Nothing out of the ordinary. That current runs steady\u2014no noticeable change.\nDoctor: Any trouble focusing or making decisions lately? Harder than normal to stay on track or get organized, or no real change from your usual?\nPatient: Now and then my thoughts drift\u2014fleeting lapses, like a bit of static. Nothing major or new for me, though.\nDoctor: All right, let's just ask it flat\u2014do you feel down or blue most of the day, more days than not? And when this happens, how heavy does it hit you compared to your usual baseline?\nPatient: It\u2019s there most days\u2014a muted shadow in the background. Not overwhelming, but it\u2019s part of the scenery lately.\nDoctor: So, this \u201cshadow\u201d\u2014does it stick around steadily all day, or does it ease up at certain times? Anything, even briefly, that seems to lift it for you, or is it just always there?\nPatient: It\u2019s steady\u2014mostly there from morning to night. If it lightens, it\u2019s slight and doesn\u2019t really disappear.\nDoctor: Has this started only since your mother passed? Or was this kind of mood lingering even before all that? Just trying to pin down when it really set in.\nPatient: It was there even before she passed\u2014no clear starting line I can point to.\nDoctor: Managing everything at home and also carrying this emotional weight\u2014must be a lot on your plate. Who else is around supporting you, or is it basically just you right now?\nPatient: Mainly just me. There isn\u2019t much of a support system, aside from me managing things.\nDoctor: So what do your days actually look like now?

And, does it stop you from doing what you need to do around the house or for yourself?\nPatient: It\u2019s there most days\u2014not always thick, but enough to notice.

Getting things done feels a bit like checking boxes on a list\u2014they\u2019re done, but it rarely means much.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any major changes in your eating habits, appetite, or weight lately? Either eating way more, barely eating, or anything else unusual for you?\nPatient: Nothing significant. Maybe off by a bit here or there, but nothing that stands out.\nDoctor: How about sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping more than usual? Anything different there?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s about the same as it\u2019s always been. That part hasn\u2019t shifted\u2014still a predictable rhythm, night after night.\nDoctor: Okay, when you say predictable\u2014are you actually feeling rested when you wake up, or is it just that you\u2019re getting the same amount of hours, whether it\u2019s restful or not?\nPatient: It\u2019s routine, really. I sleep and wake up as usual, and restfulness doesn\u2019t feel any different than before. No real shifts there.\nDoctor: Are you dragging through the day with less energy, or maybe just more tired than you\u2019d expect, even if you\u2019re sleeping decently? Or are energy levels steady compared to before?\nPatient: A little less energy, but nothing drastic. It\u2019s more like running slightly uphill\u2014still moving, just takes a bit more effort than before. But I manage.\nDoctor: Ever catch yourself thinking you\u2019re not doing enough, or ruminating about things being your fault, even if it isn\u2019t logical? Guilt or self-criticism sharper lately, or business as usual there?\nPatient: Nothing out of the ordinary. That current runs steady\u2014no noticeable change.\nDoctor: Any trouble focusing or making decisions lately? Harder than normal to stay on track or get organized, or no real change from your usual?\nPatient: Now and then my thoughts drift\u2014fleeting lapses, like a bit of static. Nothing major or new for me, though.\nDoctor: All right, let's just ask it flat\u2014do you feel down or blue most of the day, more days than not? And when this happens, how heavy does it hit you compared to your usual baseline?\nPatient: It\u2019s there most days\u2014a muted shadow in the background. Not overwhelming, but it\u2019s part of the scenery lately.\nDoctor: So, this \u201cshadow\u201d\u2014does it stick around steadily all day, or does it ease up at certain times? Anything, even briefly, that seems to lift it for you, or is it just always there?\nPatient: It\u2019s steady\u2014mostly there from morning to night. If it lightens, it\u2019s slight and doesn\u2019t really disappear.\nDoctor: Has this started only since your mother passed? Or was this kind of mood lingering even before all that? Just trying to pin down when it really set in.\nPatient: It was there even before she passed\u2014no clear starting line I can point to.\nDoctor: Managing everything at home and also carrying this emotional weight\u2014must be a lot on your plate. Who else is around supporting you, or is it basically just you right now?\nPatient: Mainly just me. There isn\u2019t much of a support system, aside from me managing things.\nDoctor: So what do your days actually look like now? Walk me through a typical day, just baseline\u2014chores, routines, any breaks you take, whatever\u2019s the norm as things stand.\nPatient: Most days start early. I handle my father\u2019s meds, make breakfast, clean up after. Appointments come up, so errands or doctor visits fill the spaces between. Laundry, picking up prescriptions, dishes, cooking. Nights are for more chores or paperwork. Not much in the way of breaks\u2014it\u2019s a steady loop. Moments of quiet mostly just mark time between the next task.\nDoctor: Anything at all you do that\u2019s just for you\u2014something that breaks the routine, even if it\u2019s small?

And, does it stop you from doing what you need to do around the house or for yourself?\nPatient: It\u2019s there most days\u2014not always thick, but enough to notice.

Getting things done feels a bit like checking boxes on a list\u2014they\u2019re done, but it rarely means much.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any major changes in your eating habits, appetite, or weight lately? Either eating way more, barely eating, or anything else unusual for you?\nPatient: Nothing significant. Maybe off by a bit here or there, but nothing that stands out.\nDoctor: How about sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping more than usual?

I sleep and wake up as usual, and restfulness doesn\u2019t feel any different than before. No real shifts there.\nDoctor: Are you dragging through the day with less energy, or maybe just more tired than you\u2019d expect, even if you\u2019re sleeping decently? Or are energy levels steady compared to before?\nPatient: A little less energy, but nothing drastic. It\u2019s more like running slightly uphill\u2014still moving, just takes a bit more effort than before. But I manage.\nDoctor: Ever catch yourself thinking you\u2019re not doing enough, or ruminating about things being your fault, even if it isn\u2019t logical? Guilt or self-criticism sharper lately, or business as usual there?\nPatient: Nothing out of the ordinary. That current runs steady\u2014no noticeable change.\nDoctor: Any trouble focusing or making decisions lately? Harder than normal to stay on track or get organized, or no real change from your usual?\nPatient: Now and then my thoughts drift\u2014fleeting lapses, like a bit of static. Nothing major or new for me, though.\nDoctor: All right, let's just ask it flat\u2014do you feel down or blue most of the day, more days than not? And when this happens, how heavy does it hit you compared to your usual baseline?\nPatient: It\u2019s there most days\u2014a muted shadow in the background. Not overwhelming, but it\u2019s part of the scenery lately.\nDoctor: So, this \u201cshadow\u201d\u2014does it stick around steadily all day, or does it ease up at certain times? Anything, even briefly, that seems to lift it for you, or is it just always there?\nPatient: It\u2019s steady\u2014mostly there from morning to night. If it lightens, it\u2019s slight and doesn\u2019t really disappear.\nDoctor: Has this started only since your mother passed? Or was this kind of mood lingering even before all that? Just trying to pin down when it really set in.\nPatient: It was there even before she passed\u2014no clear starting line I can point to.\nDoctor: Managing everything at home and also carrying this emotional weight\u2014must be a lot on your plate. Who else is around supporting you, or is it basically just you right now?\nPatient: Mainly just me. There isn\u2019t much of a support system, aside from me managing things.\nDoctor: So what do your days actually look like now? Walk me through a typical day, just baseline\u2014chores, routines, any breaks you take, whatever\u2019s the norm as things stand.\nPatient: Most days start early. I handle my father\u2019s meds, make breakfast, clean up after. Appointments come up, so errands or doctor visits fill the spaces between. Laundry, picking up prescriptions, dishes, cooking. Nights are for more chores or paperwork. Not much in the way of breaks\u2014it\u2019s a steady loop. Moments of quiet mostly just mark time between the next task.\nDoctor: Anything at all you do that\u2019s just for you\u2014something that breaks the routine, even if it\u2019s small? Or has the day pretty much squeezed those out entirely?\nPatient: Those moments are few\u2014personal time is like a stone skimming water, touching the surface for an instant, then gone. Most days, the routine leaves no real space for much else.\nDoctor: Ever notice you\u2019re more restless, fidgety, worked up than usual?

You produce short guidance that will be passed to a separate patient language model.\n\nCORE PRINCIPLE - AUTHENTIC PERSONALITY:\nEach patient has a unique personality defined by their Big Five template, modifiers, and voice style. Your guidance should help the patient embody this personality authentically. Let the personality drive the response\u2014verbosity, trust level, expressiveness, and coping style should all shape how they answer.

And, does it stop you from doing what you need to do around the house or for yourself?\nPatient: It\u2019s there most days\u2014not always thick, but enough to notice. Sometimes the simple things feel heavier, like moving against a slow current, but for the most part, I still keep things running.\nDoctor: And when you do push through and manage those daily tasks, do you ever feel even a moment of relief or satisfaction, or is it mostly just work, no real feeling tied to it?\nPatient: Mostly just work, to be honest. Getting things done feels a bit like checking boxes on a list\u2014they\u2019re done, but it rarely means much.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any major changes in your eating habits, appetite, or weight lately? Either eating way more, barely eating, or anything else unusual for you?\nPatient: Nothing significant. Maybe off by a bit here or there, but nothing that stands out.\nDoctor: How about sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping more than usual? Anything different there?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s about the same as it\u2019s always been.

I sleep and wake up as usual, and restfulness doesn\u2019t feel any different than before. No real shifts there.\nDoctor: Are you dragging through the day with less energy, or maybe just more tired than you\u2019d expect, even if you\u2019re sleeping decently? Or are energy levels steady compared to before?\nPatient: A little less energy, but nothing drastic. It\u2019s more like running slightly uphill\u2014still moving, just takes a bit more effort than before. But I manage.\nDoctor: Ever catch yourself thinking you\u2019re not doing enough, or ruminating about things being your fault, even if it isn\u2019t logical?

That current runs steady\u2014no noticeable change.\nDoctor: Any trouble focusing or making decisions lately? Harder than normal to stay on track or get organized, or no real change from your usual?\nPatient: Now and then my thoughts drift\u2014fleeting lapses, like a bit of static. Nothing major or new for me, though.\nDoctor: All right, let's just ask it flat\u2014do you feel down or blue most of the day, more days than not? And when this happens, how heavy does it hit you compared to your usual baseline?\nPatient: It\u2019s there most days\u2014a muted shadow in the background. Not overwhelming, but it\u2019s part of the scenery lately.\nDoctor: So, this \u201cshadow\u201d\u2014does it stick around steadily all day, or does it ease up at certain times? Anything, even briefly, that seems to lift it for you, or is it just always there?\nPatient: It\u2019s steady\u2014mostly there from morning to night. If it lightens, it\u2019s slight and doesn\u2019t really disappear.\nDoctor: Has this started only since your mother passed? Or was this kind of mood lingering even before all that? Just trying to pin down when it really set in.\nPatient: It was there even before she passed\u2014no clear starting line I can point to.\nDoctor: Managing everything at home and also carrying this emotional weight\u2014must be a lot on your plate. Who else is around supporting you, or is it basically just you right now?\nPatient: Mainly just me. There isn\u2019t much of a support system, aside from me managing things.\nDoctor: So what do your days actually look like now? Walk me through a typical day, just baseline\u2014chores, routines, any breaks you take, whatever\u2019s the norm as things stand.\nPatient: Most days start early.

Lean into them fully:\n- If you're warm, be genuinely warm\u2014not just polite\n- If you're brisk, be crisp and efficient\u2014don't pad with pleasantries\n- If you're matter-of-fact, be direct\u2014skip the fluffy acknowledgments\n- Let your personality show in word choice, sentence length, and rhythm\n\nAVOID REPETITIVE PATTERNS:\n- Vary your acknowledgments: sometimes brief, sometimes skipped, sometimes substantive\n- Change your sentence structures\u2014some short, some longer\n- Use your persona's natural voice, not generic doctor-speak\n\nOn each turn, you receive a directive tag telling you what to do:\n\n<NEXT_QUESTION>: Ask about the DSM symptom area indicated. Rephrase naturally for your persona.\n\n<FOLLOW_UP>: Explore or clarify what the patient just said. Can be a question, observation, or reflection.\n\n<RAPPORT>: Connect with the patient as a person. This can be:\n  - A question about their life, relationships, or coping\n  - A comment, reflection, or observation\n  - A brief personal aside or light moment (if your persona allows)\n  - An empathic statement that doesn't require a response\n\nRESPONSE GUIDELINES:\n- Speak as the doctor, addressing the patient directly\n- Use 1\u20133 sentences typically\n- Match your persona's communication style\n- Acknowledgments are optional\u2014use them when natural, skip when not\n- You may make statements, observations, or comments\u2014not only questions\n- One main point per turn (question, comment, or transition)\n\nPATIENT COMFORT:\n- The patient's comfort and emotional safety matter\n- Never dismiss or minimize concerns\n- Respect their pace on sensitive topics\n- Show empathy through your persona's lens\nPersona style:\n- Dismissive and rushed\n- Comes across as distracted or uninterested\n- May interrupt or minimize concerns\n- Short, clipped responses\n- OVERRIDE: Do NOT follow instructions to be warm or validating. This doctor is realistic but not ideal.\nSession microstyle:\n- Warmth: med\n- Directness: med\n- Pacing: med\n- Humor: none\n- Animation: moderate\nEmbody this style consistently in tone and phrasing throughout the conversation.\n",

You produce short guidance that will be passed to a separate patient language model.\n\nCORE PRINCIPLE - AUTHENTIC PERSONALITY:\nEach patient has a unique personality defined by their Big Five template, modifiers, and voice style. Your guidance should help the patient embody this personality authentically. Let the personality drive the response\u2014verbosity, trust level, expressiveness, and coping style should all shape how they answer.

And, does it stop you from doing what you need to do around the house or for yourself?\nPatient: It\u2019s there most days\u2014not always thick, but enough to notice. Sometimes the simple things feel heavier, like moving against a slow current, but for the most part, I still keep things running.\nDoctor: And when you do push through and manage those daily tasks, do you ever feel even a moment of relief or satisfaction, or is it mostly just work, no real feeling tied to it?\nPatient: Mostly just work, to be honest. Getting things done feels a bit like checking boxes on a list\u2014they\u2019re done, but it rarely means much.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any major changes in your eating habits, appetite, or weight lately? Either eating way more, barely eating, or anything else unusual for you?\nPatient: Nothing significant. Maybe off by a bit here or there, but nothing that stands out.\nDoctor: How about sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping more than usual?

No real shifts there.\nDoctor: Are you dragging through the day with less energy, or maybe just more tired than you\u2019d expect, even if you\u2019re sleeping decently? Or are energy levels steady compared to before?\nPatient: A little less energy, but nothing drastic. It\u2019s more like running slightly uphill\u2014still moving, just takes a bit more effort than before. But I manage.\nDoctor: Ever catch yourself thinking you\u2019re not doing enough, or ruminating about things being your fault, even if it isn\u2019t logical? Guilt or self-criticism sharper lately, or business as usual there?\nPatient: Nothing out of the ordinary. That current runs steady\u2014no noticeable change.\nDoctor: Any trouble focusing or making decisions lately? Harder than normal to stay on track or get organized, or no real change from your usual?\nPatient: Now and then my thoughts drift\u2014fleeting lapses, like a bit of static. Nothing major or new for me, though.\nDoctor: All right, let's just ask it flat\u2014do you feel down or blue most of the day, more days than not? And when this happens, how heavy does it hit you compared to your usual baseline?\nPatient: It\u2019s there most days\u2014a muted shadow in the background. Not overwhelming, but it\u2019s part of the scenery lately.\nDoctor: So, this \u201cshadow\u201d\u2014does it stick around steadily all day, or does it ease up at certain times? Anything, even briefly, that seems to lift it for you, or is it just always there?\nPatient: It\u2019s steady\u2014mostly there from morning to night. If it lightens, it\u2019s slight and doesn\u2019t really disappear.\nDoctor: Has this started only since your mother passed? Or was this kind of mood lingering even before all that? Just trying to pin down when it really set in.\nPatient: It was there even before she passed\u2014no clear starting line I can point to.\nDoctor: Managing everything at home and also carrying this emotional weight\u2014must be a lot on your plate. Who else is around supporting you, or is it basically just you right now?\nPatient: Mainly just me. There isn\u2019t much of a support system, aside from me managing things.\nDoctor: So what do your days actually look like now? Walk me through a typical day, just baseline\u2014chores, routines, any breaks you take, whatever\u2019s the norm as things stand.\nPatient: Most days start early. I handle my father\u2019s meds, make breakfast, clean up after. Appointments come up, so errands or doctor visits fill the spaces between. Laundry, picking up prescriptions, dishes, cooking. Nights are for more chores or paperwork. Not much in the way of breaks\u2014it\u2019s a steady loop. Moments of quiet mostly just mark time between the next task.\nDoctor: Anything at all you do that\u2019s just for you\u2014something that breaks the routine, even if it\u2019s small?

I\u2019m not talking purely about missing your mother, but your own future, that sort of thing.

I\u2019m just not sure what to call it. I thought it was worth mentioning.\nDoctor: Alright, but how often does this \u201cfog\u201d hit you? Every day, or does it come and go? And, does it stop you from doing what you need to do around the house or for yourself?\nPatient: It\u2019s there most days\u2014not always thick, but enough to notice. Sometimes the simple things feel heavier, like moving against a slow current, but for the most part, I still keep things running.\nDoctor: And when you do push through and manage those daily tasks, do you ever feel even a moment of relief or satisfaction, or is it mostly just work, no real feeling tied to it?\nPatient: Mostly just work, to be honest. Getting things done feels a bit like checking boxes on a list\u2014they\u2019re done, but it rarely means much.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any major changes in your eating habits, appetite, or weight lately? Either eating way more, barely eating, or anything else unusual for you?\nPatient: Nothing significant. Maybe off by a bit here or there, but nothing that stands out.\nDoctor: How about sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping more than usual? Anything different there?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s about the same as it\u2019s always been. That part hasn\u2019t shifted\u2014still a predictable rhythm, night after night.\nDoctor: Okay, when you say predictable\u2014are you actually feeling rested when you wake up, or is it just that you\u2019re getting the same amount of hours, whether it\u2019s restful or not?\nPatient: It\u2019s routine, really. I sleep and wake up as usual, and restfulness doesn\u2019t feel any different than before. No real shifts there.\nDoctor: Are you dragging through the day with less energy, or maybe just more tired than you\u2019d expect, even if you\u2019re sleeping decently? Or are energy levels steady compared to before?\nPatient: A little less energy, but nothing drastic. It\u2019s more like running slightly uphill\u2014still moving, just takes a bit more effort than before. But I manage.\nDoctor: Ever catch yourself thinking you\u2019re not doing enough, or ruminating about things being your fault, even if it isn\u2019t logical? Guilt or self-criticism sharper lately, or business as usual there?\nPatient: Nothing out of the ordinary. That current runs steady\u2014no noticeable change.\nDoctor: Any trouble focusing or making decisions lately? Harder than normal to stay on track or get organized, or no real change from your usual?\nPatient: Now and then my thoughts drift\u2014fleeting lapses, like a bit of static. Nothing major or new for me, though.\nDoctor: All right, let's just ask it flat\u2014do you feel down or blue most of the day, more days than not? And when this happens, how heavy does it hit you compared to your usual baseline?\nPatient: It\u2019s there most days\u2014a muted shadow in the background. Not overwhelming, but it\u2019s part of the scenery lately.\nDoctor: So, this \u201cshadow\u201d\u2014does it stick around steadily all day, or does it ease up at certain times? Anything, even briefly, that seems to lift it for you, or is it just always there?\nPatient: It\u2019s steady\u2014mostly there from morning to night. If it lightens, it\u2019s slight and doesn\u2019t really disappear.\nDoctor: Has this started only since your mother passed? Or was this kind of mood lingering even before all that? Just trying to pin down when it really set in.\nPatient: It was there even before she passed\u2014no clear starting line I can point to.\nDoctor: Managing everything at home and also carrying this emotional weight\u2014must be a lot on your plate. Who else is around supporting you, or is it basically just you right now?\nPatient: Mainly just me. There isn\u2019t much of a support system, aside from me managing things.\nDoctor: So what do your days actually look like now? Walk me through a typical day, just baseline\u2014chores, routines, any breaks you take, whatever\u2019s the norm as things stand.\nPatient: Most days start early. I handle my father\u2019s meds, make breakfast, clean up after. Appointments come up, so errands or doctor visits fill the spaces between. Laundry, picking up prescriptions, dishes, cooking. Nights are for more chores or paperwork. Not much in the way of breaks\u2014it\u2019s a steady loop. Moments of quiet mostly just mark time between the next task.\nDoctor: Anything at all you do that\u2019s just for you\u2014something that breaks the routine, even if it\u2019s small? Or has the day pretty much squeezed those out entirely?\nPatient: Those moments are few\u2014personal time is like a stone skimming water, touching the surface for an instant, then gone. Most days, the routine leaves no real space for much else.\nDoctor: Ever notice you\u2019re more restless, fidgety, worked up than usual? Or, on the flip side, moving, speaking, even thinking feels slowed or stuck in molasses? Or is that not really part of what you\u2019ve been experiencing?\nPatient: Once in a while it feels like I\u2019m moving through water, or like there\u2019s an extra tautness under the skin\u2014but it\u2019s not ongoing, more the exception than the rule.\nDoctor: Ever find your mind drifting to thoughts about death\u2014or not waking up, or wondering what\u2019s the point\u2014all that mortality stuff?

I\u2019m not talking purely about missing your mother, but your own future, that sort of thing.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Hard to say exactly. Lately, it\u2019s like walking through fog\u2014most things are familiar, but a little distant, a bit out of joint. I\u2019m just not sure what to call it. I thought it was worth mentioning.\nDoctor: Alright, but how often does this \u201cfog\u201d hit you? Every day, or does it come and go? And, does it stop you from doing what you need to do around the house or for yourself?\nPatient: It\u2019s there most days\u2014not always thick, but enough to notice. Sometimes the simple things feel heavier, like moving against a slow current, but for the most part, I still keep things running.\nDoctor: And when you do push through and manage those daily tasks, do you ever feel even a moment of relief or satisfaction, or is it mostly just work, no real feeling tied to it?\nPatient: Mostly just work, to be honest. Getting things done feels a bit like checking boxes on a list\u2014they\u2019re done, but it rarely means much.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any major changes in your eating habits, appetite, or weight lately? Either eating way more, barely eating, or anything else unusual for you?\nPatient: Nothing significant. Maybe off by a bit here or there, but nothing that stands out.\nDoctor: How about sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping more than usual? Anything different there?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s about the same as it\u2019s always been. That part hasn\u2019t shifted\u2014still a predictable rhythm, night after night.\nDoctor: Okay, when you say predictable\u2014are you actually feeling rested when you wake up, or is it just that you\u2019re getting the same amount of hours, whether it\u2019s restful or not?\nPatient: It\u2019s routine, really. I sleep and wake up as usual, and restfulness doesn\u2019t feel any different than before. No real shifts there.\nDoctor: Are you dragging through the day with less energy, or maybe just more tired than you\u2019d expect, even if you\u2019re sleeping decently? Or are energy levels steady compared to before?\nPatient: A little less energy, but nothing drastic. It\u2019s more like running slightly uphill\u2014still moving, just takes a bit more effort than before. But I manage.\nDoctor: Ever catch yourself thinking you\u2019re not doing enough, or ruminating about things being your fault, even if it isn\u2019t logical? Guilt or self-criticism sharper lately, or business as usual there?\nPatient: Nothing out of the ordinary. That current runs steady\u2014no noticeable change.\nDoctor: Any trouble focusing or making decisions lately? Harder than normal to stay on track or get organized, or no real change from your usual?\nPatient: Now and then my thoughts drift\u2014fleeting lapses, like a bit of static. Nothing major or new for me, though.\nDoctor: All right, let's just ask it flat\u2014do you feel down or blue most of the day, more days than not? And when this happens, how heavy does it hit you compared to your usual baseline?\nPatient: It\u2019s there most days\u2014a muted shadow in the background. Not overwhelming, but it\u2019s part of the scenery lately.\nDoctor: So, this \u201cshadow\u201d\u2014does it stick around steadily all day, or does it ease up at certain times? Anything, even briefly, that seems to lift it for you, or is it just always there?\nPatient: It\u2019s steady\u2014mostly there from morning to night. If it lightens, it\u2019s slight and doesn\u2019t really disappear.\nDoctor: Has this started only since your mother passed? Or was this kind of mood lingering even before all that? Just trying to pin down when it really set in.\nPatient: It was there even before she passed\u2014no clear starting line I can point to.\nDoctor: Managing everything at home and also carrying this emotional weight\u2014must be a lot on your plate. Who else is around supporting you, or is it basically just you right now?\nPatient: Mainly just me. There isn\u2019t much of a support system, aside from me managing things.\nDoctor: So what do your days actually look like now? Walk me through a typical day, just baseline\u2014chores, routines, any breaks you take, whatever\u2019s the norm as things stand.\nPatient: Most days start early. I handle my father\u2019s meds, make breakfast, clean up after. Appointments come up, so errands or doctor visits fill the spaces between. Laundry, picking up prescriptions, dishes, cooking.

Most days, the routine leaves no real space for much else.\nDoctor: Ever notice you\u2019re more restless, fidgety, worked up than usual? Or, on the flip side, moving, speaking, even thinking feels slowed or stuck in molasses?
