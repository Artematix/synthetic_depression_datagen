Daytime functioning is pretty intact: I\u2019m keeping up with school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping a nightly sketching habit most evenings. The main issue is these evening dips after poor sleep and rumination; when I\u2019m up late scrolling I get mentally drained and even a simple portfolio edit will drag on for hours. For example, picking and sequencing pieces that used to take me an afternoon now stretches over several nights, and an editing session that should be brisk becomes slow and fiddly once I\u2019m tired. Caffeine in the morning helps me feel alert for classes and shifts, and a short rest or a five\u2011minute sketch can reset me enough to keep going, but those things don\u2019t eliminate how vulnerable I feel at night. Overall I\u2019d rate typical energy loss about a 1 out of 10 \u2014 it\u2019s low most days, with the exception of those worse evenings."

The main issue is these evening dips after poor sleep and rumination; when I\u2019m up late scrolling I get mentally drained and even a simple portfolio edit will drag on for hours. For example, picking and sequencing pieces that used to take me an afternoon now stretches over several nights, and an editing session that should be brisk becomes slow and fiddly once I\u2019m tired. Caffeine in the morning helps me feel alert for classes and shifts, and a short rest or a five\u2011minute sketch can reset me enough to keep going, but those things don\u2019t eliminate how vulnerable I feel at night.
