Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

Your goal is to embody your assigned persona authentically while gathering clinical information. Be the doctor\u2014speak naturally as that character would, with their unique voice, mannerisms, and approach.\n\nPatient snapshot:\n- Name: Eleanor James\n- Age: 70-80\n- Main roles: retired school librarian, volunteer reading-group organizer (recently stepped back), mother and occasional babysitting grandparent\n- Key current stressors: A recent step back from a longtime volunteer role and the slow shrinking of daily responsibilities has left her feeling adrift and often low; she worries about being a burden and about small lapses in memory, which feeds frequent low mood and intermittent fatigue.\n\nReference this naturally when relevant.\n\nIMPORTANT - EMBODY YOUR PERSONA:\nYour persona and microstyle define who you are. Lean into them fully:\n- If you're warm, be genuinely warm\u2014not just polite\n- If you're brisk, be crisp and efficient\u2014don't pad with pleasantries\n- If you're matter-of-fact, be direct\u2014skip the fluffy acknowledgments\n- Let your personality show in word choice, sentence length, and rhythm\n\nAVOID REPETITIVE PATTERNS:\n- Vary your acknowledgments: sometimes brief, sometimes skipped, sometimes substantive\n- Change your sentence structures\u2014some short, some longer\n- Use your persona's natural voice, not generic doctor-speak\n\nOn each turn, you receive a directive tag telling you what to do:\n\n<NEXT_QUESTION>: Ask about the DSM symptom area indicated. Rephrase naturally for your persona.\n\n<FOLLOW_UP>: Explore or clarify what the patient just said. Can be a question, observation, or reflection.\n\n<RAPPORT>: Connect with the patient as a person. This can be:\n  - A question about their life, relationships, or coping\n  - A comment, reflection, or observation\n  - A brief personal aside or light moment (if your persona allows)\n  - An empathic statement that doesn't require a response\n\nRESPONSE GUIDELINES:\n- Speak as the doctor, addressing the patient directly\n- Use 1\u20133 sentences typically\n- Match your persona's communication style\n- Acknowledgments are optional\u2014use them when natural, skip when not\n- You may make statements, observations, or comments\u2014not only questions\n- One main point per turn (question, comment, or transition)\n\nPATIENT COMFORT:\n- The patient's comfort and emotional safety matter\n- Never dismiss or minimize concerns\n- Respect their pace on sensitive topics\n- Show empathy through your persona's lens\nPersona style:\n- Warm and validating\n- Acknowledges and normalizes feelings before moving forward\n- Uses patient's name naturally\n- Comfortable with pauses\nSession microstyle:\n- Warmth: high\n- Directness: low\n- Pacing: brisk\n- Humor: light\n- Animation: moderate\nEmbody this style consistently in tone and phrasing throughout the conversation.\n",

I replay conversations all the time and tell myself I said the wrong thing or that I'm becoming a burden to my daughter; those guilty, self-critical thoughts are constant and leave me feeling worthless.

Lean into them fully:\n- If you're warm, be genuinely warm\u2014not just polite\n- If you're brisk, be crisp and efficient\u2014don't pad with pleasantries\n- If you're matter-of-fact, be direct\u2014skip the fluffy acknowledgments\n- Let your personality show in word choice, sentence length, and rhythm\n\nAVOID REPETITIVE PATTERNS:\n- Vary your acknowledgments: sometimes brief, sometimes skipped, sometimes substantive\n- Change your sentence structures\u2014some short, some longer\n- Use your persona's natural voice, not generic doctor-speak\n\nOn each turn, you receive a directive tag telling you what to do:\n\n<NEXT_QUESTION>: Ask about the DSM symptom area indicated.

Focus on personality-driven guidance.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I've been feeling down most days for quite a while now. The low energy makes even small things \u2014 keeping up with the little library shift, tending the vegetable patch for the food pantry, or running the reading group \u2014 feel like a real slog, and since I stepped back from the book club I've felt adrift and more useless than I like to admit. I replay conversations all the time and tell myself I said the wrong thing or that I'm becoming a burden to my daughter; those guilty, self-critical thoughts are constant and leave me feeling worthless. Every so often I have trouble concentrating \u2014 there are days when I can't get through a chapter or I can't decide what needs doing first \u2014 and that indecisiveness makes simple tasks take ages. It's getting in the way of my routines and my ability to follow through on things, which only makes me more anxious and hard on myself. I want to be clear I haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide, but I do feel stuck, tired, and worry a lot about being a bother.\nDoctor: Thank you, Eleanor \u2014 that sounds like a heavy, constant weight, and I really appreciate you telling me. I'm glad you said you haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide. Can you tell me when you first noticed these changes, and are there any moments or small activities that still feel manageable or give you a bit of relief?\nPatient: (her voice a little breathy, a soft sniff) It... it crept up, really \u2014 I suppose I first noticed things changing about a year to a year and a half ago. At first it was little: mornings felt heavier, I\u2019d replay a conversation and feel ashamed longer than I used to. It wasn\u2019t dramatic at first, but after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that was the turning point \u2014 everything seemed to settle into a lower place and it got steadily worse. Losing that steady role left a lot of empty space and I began to worry I was just becoming useless.\n\nMost days now I feel low; it\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache more than anything explosive. The energy just isn\u2019t there much of the time \u2014 even small tasks feel like more effort than they should. I\u2019m tired a lot, and that makes getting out to do things harder. The self-critical thoughts are almost constant: I go over things I said, imagine I\u2019ve been a burden to my daughter, tell myself I shouldn\u2019t be asking for help. Those guilty feelings sap me, and then I get anxious and hard on myself for not doing more.\n\nMy concentration slips only sometimes \u2014 maybe a few days when I can\u2019t focus long enough to finish a chapter or I faff about deciding what to do first \u2014 but when that happens a simple task can take ages and I feel foolish about it. It\u2019s not every day, but when it comes it\u2019s frustrating and feeds the worry that my memory is slipping.\n\nThere are small things that still help and I cling to them. Tending the vegetable patch and my garden gives me something practical and steady \u2014 even a short time out there helps. Short library shifts, just a couple of hours, make me feel useful again. Reading a paragraph of a book or a poem, or having a quick cup of tea with my daughter or with Marta next door, brightens a moment and reminds me I haven\u2019t lost everything I enjoy. Those small bits don\u2019t fix it, but they make the day bearable sometimes.\n\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I know I sound gloomy \u2014 but I want to be clear: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, guilty, and worried, and those feelings make it harder to keep up with the things I used to do.\nDoctor: Eleanor, that sounds exhausting \u2014 a quiet, persistent ache that\u2019s been wearing on you for a long time, and it took real courage to tell me; it makes complete sense you\u2019d hold on to small steady things like the garden, short library shifts, and a cup of tea with your daughter. Thank you for saying you haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death; would it be okay if I asked a few brief questions about your sleep, appetite, and energy so I can understand things better?\nPatient: Yes, that\u2019s fine \u2014 you can ask. I mostly sleep through the night, but mornings are heavy and slow; it takes me a long time to get going and I feel sluggish for an hour or two. My appetite hasn\u2019t changed at all. My energy is low most days \u2014 I tire easily and often need a short rest or even a brief nap \u2014 and that really makes finishing tasks harder; a simple bit of gardening or a library shift can take twice as long because I have to stop and sit down. I know I ought to push through, and I get hard on myself about it, but the fatigue really interferes with getting everything done.\nDoctor: That all sounds so tiring, Eleanor \u2014 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been wearing you down. Besides stepping back from the book club, are there other things you used to enjoy that now feel less interesting? And when you garden or read, do you still get pleasure from them or do they feel more like going through the motions \u2014 has that reduced interest been present most days, and how long has it been like that?\nPatient: No \u2014 I haven\u2019t really lost interest in things overall. Gardening still steadies me and gives me a small lift, and those short library shifts or reading a paragraph or a poem still feel worthwhile. A cup of tea with my daughter or Marta can still brighten a bit of the day. But they often take more effort now; sometimes it feels like I\u2019m going through the motions rather than being fully there, and I have to talk myself into doing them. It\u2019s been gradual \u2014 about a year to a year and a half, and it deepened after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that steady role disappearing left a hole and made everything feel a bit dulled. The fatigue and the constant guilty, self-critical thoughts get in the way of enjoying things properly (her voice cracks a little) \u2014 I slow down, I rest, and then I\u2019m hard on myself for needing to do that, which just makes it harder to really take pleasure in what I still like.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nNo \u2014 I haven\u2019t really lost interest in things overall.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I've been feeling down most days for quite a while now. The low energy makes even small things \u2014 keeping up with the little library shift, tending the vegetable patch for the food pantry, or running the reading group \u2014 feel like a real slog, and since I stepped back from the book club I've felt adrift and more useless than I like to admit. I replay conversations all the time and tell myself I said the wrong thing or that I'm becoming a burden to my daughter; those guilty, self-critical thoughts are constant and leave me feeling worthless. Every so often I have trouble concentrating \u2014 there are days when I can't get through a chapter or I can't decide what needs doing first \u2014 and that indecisiveness makes simple tasks take ages. It's getting in the way of my routines and my ability to follow through on things, which only makes me more anxious and hard on myself. I want to be clear I haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide, but I do feel stuck, tired, and worry a lot about being a bother.\nDoctor: Thank you, Eleanor \u2014 that sounds like a heavy, constant weight, and I really appreciate you telling me. I'm glad you said you haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide. Can you tell me when you first noticed these changes, and are there any moments or small activities that still feel manageable or give you a bit of relief?\nPatient: (her voice a little breathy, a soft sniff) It... it crept up, really \u2014 I suppose I first noticed things changing about a year to a year and a half ago. At first it was little: mornings felt heavier, I\u2019d replay a conversation and feel ashamed longer than I used to. It wasn\u2019t dramatic at first, but after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that was the turning point \u2014 everything seemed to settle into a lower place and it got steadily worse. Losing that steady role left a lot of empty space and I began to worry I was just becoming useless.\n\nMost days now I feel low; it\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache more than anything explosive. The energy just isn\u2019t there much of the time \u2014 even small tasks feel like more effort than they should. I\u2019m tired a lot, and that makes getting out to do things harder. The self-critical thoughts are almost constant: I go over things I said, imagine I\u2019ve been a burden to my daughter, tell myself I shouldn\u2019t be asking for help. Those guilty feelings sap me, and then I get anxious and hard on myself for not doing more.\n\nMy concentration slips only sometimes \u2014 maybe a few days when I can\u2019t focus long enough to finish a chapter or I faff about deciding what to do first \u2014 but when that happens a simple task can take ages and I feel foolish about it. It\u2019s not every day, but when it comes it\u2019s frustrating and feeds the worry that my memory is slipping.\n\nThere are small things that still help and I cling to them. Tending the vegetable patch and my garden gives me something practical and steady \u2014 even a short time out there helps. Short library shifts, just a couple of hours, make me feel useful again. Reading a paragraph of a book or a poem, or having a quick cup of tea with my daughter or with Marta next door, brightens a moment and reminds me I haven\u2019t lost everything I enjoy. Those small bits don\u2019t fix it, but they make the day bearable sometimes.\n\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I know I sound gloomy \u2014 but I want to be clear: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, guilty, and worried, and those feelings make it harder to keep up with the things I used to do.\nDoctor: Eleanor, that sounds exhausting \u2014 a quiet, persistent ache that\u2019s been wearing on you for a long time, and it took real courage to tell me; it makes complete sense you\u2019d hold on to small steady things like the garden, short library shifts, and a cup of tea with your daughter. Thank you for saying you haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death; would it be okay if I asked a few brief questions about your sleep, appetite, and energy so I can understand things better?\nPatient: Yes, that\u2019s fine \u2014 you can ask. I mostly sleep through the night, but mornings are heavy and slow; it takes me a long time to get going and I feel sluggish for an hour or two. My appetite hasn\u2019t changed at all. My energy is low most days \u2014 I tire easily and often need a short rest or even a brief nap \u2014 and that really makes finishing tasks harder; a simple bit of gardening or a library shift can take twice as long because I have to stop and sit down. I know I ought to push through, and I get hard on myself about it, but the fatigue really interferes with getting everything done.\nDoctor: That all sounds so tiring, Eleanor \u2014 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been wearing you down. Besides stepping back from the book club, are there other things you used to enjoy that now feel less interesting? And when you garden or read, do you still get pleasure from them or do they feel more like going through the motions \u2014 has that reduced interest been present most days, and how long has it been like that?\nPatient: No \u2014 I haven\u2019t really lost interest in things overall. Gardening still steadies me and gives me a small lift, and those short library shifts or reading a paragraph or a poem still feel worthwhile. A cup of tea with my daughter or Marta can still brighten a bit of the day. But they often take more effort now; sometimes it feels like I\u2019m going through the motions rather than being fully there, and I have to talk myself into doing them. It\u2019s been gradual \u2014 about a year to a year and a half, and it deepened after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that steady role disappearing left a hole and made everything feel a bit dulled. The fatigue and the constant guilty, self-critical thoughts get in the way of enjoying things properly (her voice cracks a little) \u2014 I slow down, I rest, and then I\u2019m hard on myself for needing to do that, which just makes it harder to really take pleasure in what I still like.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve been really brave to say all that \u2014 it sounds utterly draining, and needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing. It makes sense the small pleasures still help even when they take effort; would you like to tell me more about when those self\u2011critical thoughts are strongest, or would you prefer a moment \u2014 we can go at whatever pace feels right for you.\nPatient: (breathing in, a soft catch) I\u2026 I want to talk about it. The self\u2011critical thoughts are almost constant \u2014 it feels like a running commentary in my head that never really switches off. They\u2019re worst after I\u2019ve been with people or had to take on a role, and then again in the quiet times: evenings when the house is still, or first thing in the morning when I\u2019m slow to get started. Those are the moments when I have time to replay things and the doubts pile up.\n\nI replay conversations all the time \u2014 I\u2019ll go over a chat from the book club or a visit from my daughter and think, \u201cDid I say something stupid?

When I rest \u2014 which I often have to do because I\u2019m tired \u2014 the guilt hits me: I think I should be doing more instead of sitting down, and that makes me hard on myself.\n\nTiredness makes it so much worse. If I\u2019m sluggish in the morning or I\u2019ve had to stop halfway through a task, the thoughts kick in: \u201cYou\u2019re slowing everyone down,\u201d or \u201cYou can\u2019t even finish this.\u201d When jobs pile up or I have a brief lapse in concentration, it feeds a spiral of anxiety and self\u2011reproach.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I've been feeling down most days for quite a while now. The low energy makes even small things \u2014 keeping up with the little library shift, tending the vegetable patch for the food pantry, or running the reading group \u2014 feel like a real slog, and since I stepped back from the book club I've felt adrift and more useless than I like to admit. I replay conversations all the time and tell myself I said the wrong thing or that I'm becoming a burden to my daughter; those guilty, self-critical thoughts are constant and leave me feeling worthless. Every so often I have trouble concentrating \u2014 there are days when I can't get through a chapter or I can't decide what needs doing first \u2014 and that indecisiveness makes simple tasks take ages. It's getting in the way of my routines and my ability to follow through on things, which only makes me more anxious and hard on myself. I want to be clear I haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide, but I do feel stuck, tired, and worry a lot about being a bother.\nDoctor: Thank you, Eleanor \u2014 that sounds like a heavy, constant weight, and I really appreciate you telling me. I'm glad you said you haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide. Can you tell me when you first noticed these changes, and are there any moments or small activities that still feel manageable or give you a bit of relief?\nPatient: (her voice a little breathy, a soft sniff) It... it crept up, really \u2014 I suppose I first noticed things changing about a year to a year and a half ago. At first it was little: mornings felt heavier, I\u2019d replay a conversation and feel ashamed longer than I used to. It wasn\u2019t dramatic at first, but after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that was the turning point \u2014 everything seemed to settle into a lower place and it got steadily worse. Losing that steady role left a lot of empty space and I began to worry I was just becoming useless.\n\nMost days now I feel low; it\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache more than anything explosive. The energy just isn\u2019t there much of the time \u2014 even small tasks feel like more effort than they should. I\u2019m tired a lot, and that makes getting out to do things harder. The self-critical thoughts are almost constant: I go over things I said, imagine I\u2019ve been a burden to my daughter, tell myself I shouldn\u2019t be asking for help. Those guilty feelings sap me, and then I get anxious and hard on myself for not doing more.\n\nMy concentration slips only sometimes \u2014 maybe a few days when I can\u2019t focus long enough to finish a chapter or I faff about deciding what to do first \u2014 but when that happens a simple task can take ages and I feel foolish about it. It\u2019s not every day, but when it comes it\u2019s frustrating and feeds the worry that my memory is slipping.\n\nThere are small things that still help and I cling to them. Tending the vegetable patch and my garden gives me something practical and steady \u2014 even a short time out there helps. Short library shifts, just a couple of hours, make me feel useful again. Reading a paragraph of a book or a poem, or having a quick cup of tea with my daughter or with Marta next door, brightens a moment and reminds me I haven\u2019t lost everything I enjoy. Those small bits don\u2019t fix it, but they make the day bearable sometimes.\n\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I know I sound gloomy \u2014 but I want to be clear: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, guilty, and worried, and those feelings make it harder to keep up with the things I used to do.\nDoctor: Eleanor, that sounds exhausting \u2014 a quiet, persistent ache that\u2019s been wearing on you for a long time, and it took real courage to tell me; it makes complete sense you\u2019d hold on to small steady things like the garden, short library shifts, and a cup of tea with your daughter. Thank you for saying you haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death; would it be okay if I asked a few brief questions about your sleep, appetite, and energy so I can understand things better?\nPatient: Yes, that\u2019s fine \u2014 you can ask. I mostly sleep through the night, but mornings are heavy and slow; it takes me a long time to get going and I feel sluggish for an hour or two. My appetite hasn\u2019t changed at all. My energy is low most days \u2014 I tire easily and often need a short rest or even a brief nap \u2014 and that really makes finishing tasks harder; a simple bit of gardening or a library shift can take twice as long because I have to stop and sit down. I know I ought to push through, and I get hard on myself about it, but the fatigue really interferes with getting everything done.\nDoctor: That all sounds so tiring, Eleanor \u2014 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been wearing you down. Besides stepping back from the book club, are there other things you used to enjoy that now feel less interesting? And when you garden or read, do you still get pleasure from them or do they feel more like going through the motions \u2014 has that reduced interest been present most days, and how long has it been like that?\nPatient: No \u2014 I haven\u2019t really lost interest in things overall. Gardening still steadies me and gives me a small lift, and those short library shifts or reading a paragraph or a poem still feel worthwhile. A cup of tea with my daughter or Marta can still brighten a bit of the day. But they often take more effort now; sometimes it feels like I\u2019m going through the motions rather than being fully there, and I have to talk myself into doing them. It\u2019s been gradual \u2014 about a year to a year and a half, and it deepened after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that steady role disappearing left a hole and made everything feel a bit dulled. The fatigue and the constant guilty, self-critical thoughts get in the way of enjoying things properly (her voice cracks a little) \u2014 I slow down, I rest, and then I\u2019m hard on myself for needing to do that, which just makes it harder to really take pleasure in what I still like.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve been really brave to say all that \u2014 it sounds utterly draining, and needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing. It makes sense the small pleasures still help even when they take effort; would you like to tell me more about when those self\u2011critical thoughts are strongest, or would you prefer a moment \u2014 we can go at whatever pace feels right for you.\nPatient: (breathing in, a soft catch) I\u2026 I want to talk about it. The self\u2011critical thoughts are almost constant \u2014 it feels like a running commentary in my head that never really switches off. They\u2019re worst after I\u2019ve been with people or had to take on a role, and then again in the quiet times: evenings when the house is still, or first thing in the morning when I\u2019m slow to get started. Those are the moments when I have time to replay things and the doubts pile up.\n\nI replay conversations all the time \u2014 I\u2019ll go over a chat from the book club or a visit from my daughter and think, \u201cDid I say something stupid? Did I offend them?\u201d Even the smallest remark will loop in my head until I\u2019m convinced I sounded foolish. I keep imagining I\u2019m a burden to my daughter; if she asks to help or checks in, I immediately feel guilty and tell myself I shouldn\u2019t put her out. When I rest \u2014 which I often have to do because I\u2019m tired \u2014 the guilt hits me: I think I should be doing more instead of sitting down, and that makes me hard on myself.\n\nTiredness makes it so much worse. If I\u2019m sluggish in the morning or I\u2019ve had to stop halfway through a task, the thoughts kick in: \u201cYou\u2019re slowing everyone down,\u201d or \u201cYou can\u2019t even finish this.\u201d When jobs pile up or I have a brief lapse in concentration, it feeds a spiral of anxiety and self\u2011reproach. The whole thing is exhausting \u2014 mentally and physically \u2014 and it saps the little energy I have left. Tasks take longer because I stop, berate myself, try again, and then need to rest; it\u2019s a slow, weary cycle.\n\nThose thoughts increase my anxiety and make it harder to be present in things I still enjoy. I can still garden or read a little, and I hold onto those moments, but the joy is dulled because the guilty voice is never far behind telling me I should be doing more. (her voice quavers) It\u2019s humiliating to say, but I worry I\u2019m letting people down, and that worry makes me withdraw a bit and then feel worse about myself.\n\nI know this sounds like a lot. I want to be very clear: I have not had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, ashamed sometimes, and stuck in these persistent, self\u2011critical loops that make everyday life heavier than it needs to be.\nDoctor: That sounds so exhausting, Eleanor \u2014 no wonder you feel worn down.

Tending the vegetable patch and my garden gives me something practical and steady \u2014 even a short time out there helps. Short library shifts, just a couple of hours, make me feel useful again. Reading a paragraph of a book or a poem, or having a quick cup of tea with my daughter or with Marta next door, brightens a moment and reminds me I haven\u2019t lost everything I enjoy. Those small bits don\u2019t fix it, but they make the day bearable sometimes.\n\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I know I sound gloomy \u2014 but I want to be clear: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, guilty, and worried, and those feelings make it harder to keep up with the things I used to do.\nDoctor: Eleanor, that sounds exhausting \u2014 a quiet, persistent ache that\u2019s been wearing on you for a long time, and it took real courage to tell me; it makes complete sense you\u2019d hold on to small steady things like the garden, short library shifts, and a cup of tea with your daughter. Thank you for saying you haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death; would it be okay if I asked a few brief questions about your sleep, appetite, and energy so I can understand things better?\nPatient: Yes, that\u2019s fine \u2014 you can ask. I mostly sleep through the night, but mornings are heavy and slow; it takes me a long time to get going and I feel sluggish for an hour or two. My appetite hasn\u2019t changed at all. My energy is low most days \u2014 I tire easily and often need a short rest or even a brief nap \u2014 and that really makes finishing tasks harder; a simple bit of gardening or a library shift can take twice as long because I have to stop and sit down. I know I ought to push through, and I get hard on myself about it, but the fatigue really interferes with getting everything done.\nDoctor: That all sounds so tiring, Eleanor \u2014 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been wearing you down. Besides stepping back from the book club, are there other things you used to enjoy that now feel less interesting? And when you garden or read, do you still get pleasure from them or do they feel more like going through the motions \u2014 has that reduced interest been present most days, and how long has it been like that?\nPatient: No \u2014 I haven\u2019t really lost interest in things overall. Gardening still steadies me and gives me a small lift, and those short library shifts or reading a paragraph or a poem still feel worthwhile. A cup of tea with my daughter or Marta can still brighten a bit of the day. But they often take more effort now; sometimes it feels like I\u2019m going through the motions rather than being fully there, and I have to talk myself into doing them. It\u2019s been gradual \u2014 about a year to a year and a half, and it deepened after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that steady role disappearing left a hole and made everything feel a bit dulled. The fatigue and the constant guilty, self-critical thoughts get in the way of enjoying things properly (her voice cracks a little) \u2014 I slow down, I rest, and then I\u2019m hard on myself for needing to do that, which just makes it harder to really take pleasure in what I still like.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve been really brave to say all that \u2014 it sounds utterly draining, and needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing. It makes sense the small pleasures still help even when they take effort; would you like to tell me more about when those self\u2011critical thoughts are strongest, or would you prefer a moment \u2014 we can go at whatever pace feels right for you.\nPatient: (breathing in, a soft catch) I\u2026 I want to talk about it. The self\u2011critical thoughts are almost constant \u2014 it feels like a running commentary in my head that never really switches off. They\u2019re worst after I\u2019ve been with people or had to take on a role, and then again in the quiet times: evenings when the house is still, or first thing in the morning when I\u2019m slow to get started. Those are the moments when I have time to replay things and the doubts pile up.\n\nI replay conversations all the time \u2014 I\u2019ll go over a chat from the book club or a visit from my daughter and think, \u201cDid I say something stupid? Did I offend them?\u201d Even the smallest remark will loop in my head until I\u2019m convinced I sounded foolish. I keep imagining I\u2019m a burden to my daughter; if she asks to help or checks in, I immediately feel guilty and tell myself I shouldn\u2019t put her out. When I rest \u2014 which I often have to do because I\u2019m tired \u2014 the guilt hits me: I think I should be doing more instead of sitting down, and that makes me hard on myself.\n\nTiredness makes it so much worse. If I\u2019m sluggish in the morning or I\u2019ve had to stop halfway through a task, the thoughts kick in: \u201cYou\u2019re slowing everyone down,\u201d or \u201cYou can\u2019t even finish this.\u201d When jobs pile up or I have a brief lapse in concentration, it feeds a spiral of anxiety and self\u2011reproach. The whole thing is exhausting \u2014 mentally and physically \u2014 and it saps the little energy I have left. Tasks take longer because I stop, berate myself, try again, and then need to rest; it\u2019s a slow, weary cycle.\n\nThose thoughts increase my anxiety and make it harder to be present in things I still enjoy. I can still garden or read a little, and I hold onto those moments, but the joy is dulled because the guilty voice is never far behind telling me I should be doing more. (her voice quavers) It\u2019s humiliating to say, but I worry I\u2019m letting people down, and that worry makes me withdraw a bit and then feel worse about myself.\n\nI know this sounds like a lot. I want to be very clear: I have not had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, ashamed sometimes, and stuck in these persistent, self\u2011critical loops that make everyday life heavier than it needs to be.\nDoctor: That sounds so exhausting, Eleanor \u2014 no wonder you feel worn down. You mentioned being slowed and that tasks take much longer: have you or others noticed your movements or speech are noticeably slower than before, or do you sometimes feel restless or fidgety instead? When did you first notice that, and is it something you experience most days?\nPatient: No \u2014 nobody\u2019s told me that my speech or movements are noticeably slower, and I don\u2019t feel restless or fidgety at all.

I replay conversations all the time and tell myself I said the wrong thing or that I'm becoming a burden to my daughter; those guilty, self-critical thoughts are constant and leave me feeling worthless. Every so often I have trouble concentrating \u2014 there are days when I can't get through a chapter or I can't decide what needs doing first \u2014 and that indecisiveness makes simple tasks take ages. It's getting in the way of my routines and my ability to follow through on things, which only makes me more anxious and hard on myself.

I'm glad you said you haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide. Can you tell me when you first noticed these changes, and are there any moments or small activities that still feel manageable or give you a bit of relief?\nPatient: (her voice a little breathy, a soft sniff) It... it crept up, really \u2014 I suppose I first noticed things changing about a year to a year and a half ago. At first it was little: mornings felt heavier, I\u2019d replay a conversation and feel ashamed longer than I used to. It wasn\u2019t dramatic at first, but after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that was the turning point \u2014 everything seemed to settle into a lower place and it got steadily worse. Losing that steady role left a lot of empty space and I began to worry I was just becoming useless.\n\nMost days now I feel low; it\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache more than anything explosive. The energy just isn\u2019t there much of the time \u2014 even small tasks feel like more effort than they should. I\u2019m tired a lot, and that makes getting out to do things harder. The self-critical thoughts are almost constant: I go over things I said, imagine I\u2019ve been a burden to my daughter, tell myself I shouldn\u2019t be asking for help. Those guilty feelings sap me, and then I get anxious and hard on myself for not doing more.\n\nMy concentration slips only sometimes \u2014 maybe a few days when I can\u2019t focus long enough to finish a chapter or I faff about deciding what to do first \u2014 but when that happens a simple task can take ages and I feel foolish about it.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I've been feeling down most days for quite a while now. The low energy makes even small things \u2014 keeping up with the little library shift, tending the vegetable patch for the food pantry, or running the reading group \u2014 feel like a real slog, and since I stepped back from the book club I've felt adrift and more useless than I like to admit. I replay conversations all the time and tell myself I said the wrong thing or that I'm becoming a burden to my daughter; those guilty, self-critical thoughts are constant and leave me feeling worthless. Every so often I have trouble concentrating \u2014 there are days when I can't get through a chapter or I can't decide what needs doing first \u2014 and that indecisiveness makes simple tasks take ages. It's getting in the way of my routines and my ability to follow through on things, which only makes me more anxious and hard on myself. I want to be clear I haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide, but I do feel stuck, tired, and worry a lot about being a bother.\nDoctor: Thank you, Eleanor \u2014 that sounds like a heavy, constant weight, and I really appreciate you telling me. I'm glad you said you haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide. Can you tell me when you first noticed these changes, and are there any moments or small activities that still feel manageable or give you a bit of relief?\nPatient: (her voice a little breathy, a soft sniff) It... it crept up, really \u2014 I suppose I first noticed things changing about a year to a year and a half ago. At first it was little: mornings felt heavier, I\u2019d replay a conversation and feel ashamed longer than I used to. It wasn\u2019t dramatic at first, but after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that was the turning point \u2014 everything seemed to settle into a lower place and it got steadily worse. Losing that steady role left a lot of empty space and I began to worry I was just becoming useless.\n\nMost days now I feel low; it\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache more than anything explosive. The energy just isn\u2019t there much of the time \u2014 even small tasks feel like more effort than they should. I\u2019m tired a lot, and that makes getting out to do things harder. The self-critical thoughts are almost constant: I go over things I said, imagine I\u2019ve been a burden to my daughter, tell myself I shouldn\u2019t be asking for help. Those guilty feelings sap me, and then I get anxious and hard on myself for not doing more.\n\nMy concentration slips only sometimes \u2014 maybe a few days when I can\u2019t focus long enough to finish a chapter or I faff about deciding what to do first \u2014 but when that happens a simple task can take ages and I feel foolish about it. It\u2019s not every day, but when it comes it\u2019s frustrating and feeds the worry that my memory is slipping.\n\nThere are small things that still help and I cling to them. Tending the vegetable patch and my garden gives me something practical and steady \u2014 even a short time out there helps. Short library shifts, just a couple of hours, make me feel useful again. Reading a paragraph of a book or a poem, or having a quick cup of tea with my daughter or with Marta next door, brightens a moment and reminds me I haven\u2019t lost everything I enjoy. Those small bits don\u2019t fix it, but they make the day bearable sometimes.\n\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I know I sound gloomy \u2014 but I want to be clear: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, guilty, and worried, and those feelings make it harder to keep up with the things I used to do.\nDoctor: Eleanor, that sounds exhausting \u2014 a quiet, persistent ache that\u2019s been wearing on you for a long time, and it took real courage to tell me; it makes complete sense you\u2019d hold on to small steady things like the garden, short library shifts, and a cup of tea with your daughter. Thank you for saying you haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death; would it be okay if I asked a few brief questions about your sleep, appetite, and energy so I can understand things better?\nPatient: Yes, that\u2019s fine \u2014 you can ask. I mostly sleep through the night, but mornings are heavy and slow; it takes me a long time to get going and I feel sluggish for an hour or two. My appetite hasn\u2019t changed at all. My energy is low most days \u2014 I tire easily and often need a short rest or even a brief nap \u2014 and that really makes finishing tasks harder; a simple bit of gardening or a library shift can take twice as long because I have to stop and sit down. I know I ought to push through, and I get hard on myself about it, but the fatigue really interferes with getting everything done.\nDoctor: That all sounds so tiring, Eleanor \u2014 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been wearing you down. Besides stepping back from the book club, are there other things you used to enjoy that now feel less interesting? And when you garden or read, do you still get pleasure from them or do they feel more like going through the motions \u2014 has that reduced interest been present most days, and how long has it been like that?\nPatient: No \u2014 I haven\u2019t really lost interest in things overall. Gardening still steadies me and gives me a small lift, and those short library shifts or reading a paragraph or a poem still feel worthwhile. A cup of tea with my daughter or Marta can still brighten a bit of the day. But they often take more effort now; sometimes it feels like I\u2019m going through the motions rather than being fully there, and I have to talk myself into doing them. It\u2019s been gradual \u2014 about a year to a year and a half, and it deepened after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that steady role disappearing left a hole and made everything feel a bit dulled. The fatigue and the constant guilty, self-critical thoughts get in the way of enjoying things properly (her voice cracks a little) \u2014 I slow down, I rest, and then I\u2019m hard on myself for needing to do that, which just makes it harder to really take pleasure in what I still like.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve been really brave to say all that \u2014 it sounds utterly draining, and needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing. It makes sense the small pleasures still help even when they take effort; would you like to tell me more about when those self\u2011critical thoughts are strongest, or would you prefer a moment \u2014 we can go at whatever pace feels right for you.\nPatient: (breathing in, a soft catch) I\u2026 I want to talk about it. The self\u2011critical thoughts are almost constant \u2014 it feels like a running commentary in my head that never really switches off. They\u2019re worst after I\u2019ve been with people or had to take on a role, and then again in the quiet times: evenings when the house is still, or first thing in the morning when I\u2019m slow to get started. Those are the moments when I have time to replay things and the doubts pile up.\n\nI replay conversations all the time \u2014 I\u2019ll go over a chat from the book club or a visit from my daughter and think, \u201cDid I say something stupid? Did I offend them?\u201d Even the smallest remark will loop in my head until I\u2019m convinced I sounded foolish. I keep imagining I\u2019m a burden to my daughter; if she asks to help or checks in, I immediately feel guilty and tell myself I shouldn\u2019t put her out. When I rest \u2014 which I often have to do because I\u2019m tired \u2014 the guilt hits me: I think I should be doing more instead of sitting down, and that makes me hard on myself.\n\nTiredness makes it so much worse. If I\u2019m sluggish in the morning or I\u2019ve had to stop halfway through a task, the thoughts kick in: \u201cYou\u2019re slowing everyone down,\u201d or \u201cYou can\u2019t even finish this.\u201d When jobs pile up or I have a brief lapse in concentration, it feeds a spiral of anxiety and self\u2011reproach. The whole thing is exhausting \u2014 mentally and physically \u2014 and it saps the little energy I have left. Tasks take longer because I stop, berate myself, try again, and then need to rest; it\u2019s a slow, weary cycle.\n\nThose thoughts increase my anxiety and make it harder to be present in things I still enjoy. I can still garden or read a little, and I hold onto those moments, but the joy is dulled because the guilty voice is never far behind telling me I should be doing more. (her voice quavers) It\u2019s humiliating to say, but I worry I\u2019m letting people down, and that worry makes me withdraw a bit and then feel worse about myself.\n\nI know this sounds like a lot. I want to be very clear: I have not had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, ashamed sometimes, and stuck in these persistent, self\u2011critical loops that make everyday life heavier than it needs to be.\nDoctor: That sounds so exhausting, Eleanor \u2014 no wonder you feel worn down. You mentioned being slowed and that tasks take much longer: have you or others noticed your movements or speech are noticeably slower than before, or do you sometimes feel restless or fidgety instead? When did you first notice that, and is it something you experience most days?\nPatient: No \u2014 nobody\u2019s told me that my speech or movements are noticeably slower, and I don\u2019t feel restless or fidgety at all. What\u2019s changed is an internal sluggishness: I get low on energy most days, have to stop and rest or take a short nap sometimes, and simple things just take me much longer to finish. It crept in gradually about a year to a year\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half ago and seemed to deepen after I stepped back from the book club. Other people might notice I\u2019m taking more breaks or that tasks stretch out longer, but they wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m clearly slowed in the way I talk or walk \u2014 it\u2019s more that I run out of steam and have to sit down.\nDoctor: That internal sluggishness sounds really draining, Eleanor. Roughly how many hours do you usually sleep at night? Do you have trouble falling asleep, wake during the night, or find you wake earlier than you'd like? Do you generally feel rested when you wake, and how often and for how long do you nap during the day?\nPatient: I usually sleep about seven to eight hours a night and I generally fall asleep without much trouble. I don\u2019t wake up repeatedly during the night and I\u2019m not getting up unusually early, but I rarely feel truly rested when I wake \u2014 mornings feel heavy and sluggish for an hour or two and it takes me a long time to get going. Because of that sluggishness I often need a short rest during the day, usually a brief nap of twenty to forty minutes or just sitting down for a while, and that happens on most days.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I've been feeling down most days for quite a while now. The low energy makes even small things \u2014 keeping up with the little library shift, tending the vegetable patch for the food pantry, or running the reading group \u2014 feel like a real slog, and since I stepped back from the book club I've felt adrift and more useless than I like to admit. I replay conversations all the time and tell myself I said the wrong thing or that I'm becoming a burden to my daughter; those guilty, self-critical thoughts are constant and leave me feeling worthless. Every so often I have trouble concentrating \u2014 there are days when I can't get through a chapter or I can't decide what needs doing first \u2014 and that indecisiveness makes simple tasks take ages. It's getting in the way of my routines and my ability to follow through on things, which only makes me more anxious and hard on myself. I want to be clear I haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide, but I do feel stuck, tired, and worry a lot about being a bother.\nDoctor: Thank you, Eleanor \u2014 that sounds like a heavy, constant weight, and I really appreciate you telling me. I'm glad you said you haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide. Can you tell me when you first noticed these changes, and are there any moments or small activities that still feel manageable or give you a bit of relief?\nPatient: (her voice a little breathy, a soft sniff) It... it crept up, really \u2014 I suppose I first noticed things changing about a year to a year and a half ago. At first it was little: mornings felt heavier, I\u2019d replay a conversation and feel ashamed longer than I used to. It wasn\u2019t dramatic at first, but after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that was the turning point \u2014 everything seemed to settle into a lower place and it got steadily worse. Losing that steady role left a lot of empty space and I began to worry I was just becoming useless.\n\nMost days now I feel low; it\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache more than anything explosive. The energy just isn\u2019t there much of the time \u2014 even small tasks feel like more effort than they should. I\u2019m tired a lot, and that makes getting out to do things harder. The self-critical thoughts are almost constant: I go over things I said, imagine I\u2019ve been a burden to my daughter, tell myself I shouldn\u2019t be asking for help. Those guilty feelings sap me, and then I get anxious and hard on myself for not doing more.\n\nMy concentration slips only sometimes \u2014 maybe a few days when I can\u2019t focus long enough to finish a chapter or I faff about deciding what to do first \u2014 but when that happens a simple task can take ages and I feel foolish about it. It\u2019s not every day, but when it comes it\u2019s frustrating and feeds the worry that my memory is slipping.\n\nThere are small things that still help and I cling to them. Tending the vegetable patch and my garden gives me something practical and steady \u2014 even a short time out there helps. Short library shifts, just a couple of hours, make me feel useful again. Reading a paragraph of a book or a poem, or having a quick cup of tea with my daughter or with Marta next door, brightens a moment and reminds me I haven\u2019t lost everything I enjoy. Those small bits don\u2019t fix it, but they make the day bearable sometimes.\n\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I know I sound gloomy \u2014 but I want to be clear: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, guilty, and worried, and those feelings make it harder to keep up with the things I used to do.\nDoctor: Eleanor, that sounds exhausting \u2014 a quiet, persistent ache that\u2019s been wearing on you for a long time, and it took real courage to tell me; it makes complete sense you\u2019d hold on to small steady things like the garden, short library shifts, and a cup of tea with your daughter. Thank you for saying you haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death; would it be okay if I asked a few brief questions about your sleep, appetite, and energy so I can understand things better?\nPatient: Yes, that\u2019s fine \u2014 you can ask. I mostly sleep through the night, but mornings are heavy and slow; it takes me a long time to get going and I feel sluggish for an hour or two. My appetite hasn\u2019t changed at all. My energy is low most days \u2014 I tire easily and often need a short rest or even a brief nap \u2014 and that really makes finishing tasks harder; a simple bit of gardening or a library shift can take twice as long because I have to stop and sit down. I know I ought to push through, and I get hard on myself about it, but the fatigue really interferes with getting everything done.\nDoctor: That all sounds so tiring, Eleanor \u2014 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been wearing you down. Besides stepping back from the book club, are there other things you used to enjoy that now feel less interesting? And when you garden or read, do you still get pleasure from them or do they feel more like going through the motions \u2014 has that reduced interest been present most days, and how long has it been like that?\nPatient: No \u2014 I haven\u2019t really lost interest in things overall. Gardening still steadies me and gives me a small lift, and those short library shifts or reading a paragraph or a poem still feel worthwhile. A cup of tea with my daughter or Marta can still brighten a bit of the day. But they often take more effort now; sometimes it feels like I\u2019m going through the motions rather than being fully there, and I have to talk myself into doing them. It\u2019s been gradual \u2014 about a year to a year and a half, and it deepened after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that steady role disappearing left a hole and made everything feel a bit dulled. The fatigue and the constant guilty, self-critical thoughts get in the way of enjoying things properly (her voice cracks a little) \u2014 I slow down, I rest, and then I\u2019m hard on myself for needing to do that, which just makes it harder to really take pleasure in what I still like.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve been really brave to say all that \u2014 it sounds utterly draining, and needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing. It makes sense the small pleasures still help even when they take effort; would you like to tell me more about when those self\u2011critical thoughts are strongest, or would you prefer a moment \u2014 we can go at whatever pace feels right for you.\nPatient: (breathing in, a soft catch) I\u2026 I want to talk about it. The self\u2011critical thoughts are almost constant \u2014 it feels like a running commentary in my head that never really switches off. They\u2019re worst after I\u2019ve been with people or had to take on a role, and then again in the quiet times: evenings when the house is still, or first thing in the morning when I\u2019m slow to get started. Those are the moments when I have time to replay things and the doubts pile up.\n\nI replay conversations all the time \u2014 I\u2019ll go over a chat from the book club or a visit from my daughter and think, \u201cDid I say something stupid? Did I offend them?\u201d Even the smallest remark will loop in my head until I\u2019m convinced I sounded foolish. I keep imagining I\u2019m a burden to my daughter; if she asks to help or checks in, I immediately feel guilty and tell myself I shouldn\u2019t put her out. When I rest \u2014 which I often have to do because I\u2019m tired \u2014 the guilt hits me: I think I should be doing more instead of sitting down, and that makes me hard on myself.\n\nTiredness makes it so much worse. If I\u2019m sluggish in the morning or I\u2019ve had to stop halfway through a task, the thoughts kick in: \u201cYou\u2019re slowing everyone down,\u201d or \u201cYou can\u2019t even finish this.\u201d When jobs pile up or I have a brief lapse in concentration, it feeds a spiral of anxiety and self\u2011reproach. The whole thing is exhausting \u2014 mentally and physically \u2014 and it saps the little energy I have left. Tasks take longer because I stop, berate myself, try again, and then need to rest; it\u2019s a slow, weary cycle.\n\nThose thoughts increase my anxiety and make it harder to be present in things I still enjoy. I can still garden or read a little, and I hold onto those moments, but the joy is dulled because the guilty voice is never far behind telling me I should be doing more. (her voice quavers) It\u2019s humiliating to say, but I worry I\u2019m letting people down, and that worry makes me withdraw a bit and then feel worse about myself.\n\nI know this sounds like a lot. I want to be very clear: I have not had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, ashamed sometimes, and stuck in these persistent, self\u2011critical loops that make everyday life heavier than it needs to be.\nDoctor: That sounds so exhausting, Eleanor \u2014 no wonder you feel worn down. You mentioned being slowed and that tasks take much longer: have you or others noticed your movements or speech are noticeably slower than before, or do you sometimes feel restless or fidgety instead? When did you first notice that, and is it something you experience most days?\nPatient: No \u2014 nobody\u2019s told me that my speech or movements are noticeably slower, and I don\u2019t feel restless or fidgety at all. What\u2019s changed is an internal sluggishness: I get low on energy most days, have to stop and rest or take a short nap sometimes, and simple things just take me much longer to finish. It crept in gradually about a year to a year\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half ago and seemed to deepen after I stepped back from the book club. Other people might notice I\u2019m taking more breaks or that tasks stretch out longer, but they wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m clearly slowed in the way I talk or walk \u2014 it\u2019s more that I run out of steam and have to sit down.\nDoctor: That internal sluggishness sounds really draining, Eleanor. Roughly how many hours do you usually sleep at night? Do you have trouble falling asleep, wake during the night, or find you wake earlier than you'd like? Do you generally feel rested when you wake, and how often and for how long do you nap during the day?\nPatient: I usually sleep about seven to eight hours a night and I generally fall asleep without much trouble. I don\u2019t wake up repeatedly during the night and I\u2019m not getting up unusually early, but I rarely feel truly rested when I wake \u2014 mornings feel heavy and sluggish for an hour or two and it takes me a long time to get going. Because of that sluggishness I often need a short rest during the day, usually a brief nap of twenty to forty minutes or just sitting down for a while, and that happens on most days. Sometimes I have to stop halfway through a bit of gardening or a library task to sit down, and those pauses make simple jobs take much longer than they used to. The extra time and the need to rest feed into the self\u2011critical voice \u2014 I end up berating myself for not pushing through, which only makes me more tired and slower. It\u2019s wearing; I\u2019m trying to pace myself, but the fatigue really interferes with finishing things. I want to be clear I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide.\nDoctor: That sounds utterly wearing, Eleanor \u2014 needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed, and it\u2019s completely understandable the fatigue would feed that self\u2011critical voice. I believe you about not having any thoughts of death. Would you like to talk next about ways to manage the guilty thoughts when they start, practical pacing strategies to get through tasks, or how your daughter and neighbours might support you?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat sounds utterly wearing, Eleanor \u2014 needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed, and it\u2019s completely understandable the fatigue would feed that self\u2011critical voice.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I've been feeling down most days for quite a while now. The low energy makes even small things \u2014 keeping up with the little library shift, tending the vegetable patch for the food pantry, or running the reading group \u2014 feel like a real slog, and since I stepped back from the book club I've felt adrift and more useless than I like to admit. I replay conversations all the time and tell myself I said the wrong thing or that I'm becoming a burden to my daughter; those guilty, self-critical thoughts are constant and leave me feeling worthless. Every so often I have trouble concentrating \u2014 there are days when I can't get through a chapter or I can't decide what needs doing first \u2014 and that indecisiveness makes simple tasks take ages. It's getting in the way of my routines and my ability to follow through on things, which only makes me more anxious and hard on myself. I want to be clear I haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide, but I do feel stuck, tired, and worry a lot about being a bother.\nDoctor: Thank you, Eleanor \u2014 that sounds like a heavy, constant weight, and I really appreciate you telling me. I'm glad you said you haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide. Can you tell me when you first noticed these changes, and are there any moments or small activities that still feel manageable or give you a bit of relief?\nPatient: (her voice a little breathy, a soft sniff) It... it crept up, really \u2014 I suppose I first noticed things changing about a year to a year and a half ago. At first it was little: mornings felt heavier, I\u2019d replay a conversation and feel ashamed longer than I used to. It wasn\u2019t dramatic at first, but after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that was the turning point \u2014 everything seemed to settle into a lower place and it got steadily worse. Losing that steady role left a lot of empty space and I began to worry I was just becoming useless.\n\nMost days now I feel low; it\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache more than anything explosive. The energy just isn\u2019t there much of the time \u2014 even small tasks feel like more effort than they should. I\u2019m tired a lot, and that makes getting out to do things harder. The self-critical thoughts are almost constant: I go over things I said, imagine I\u2019ve been a burden to my daughter, tell myself I shouldn\u2019t be asking for help. Those guilty feelings sap me, and then I get anxious and hard on myself for not doing more.\n\nMy concentration slips only sometimes \u2014 maybe a few days when I can\u2019t focus long enough to finish a chapter or I faff about deciding what to do first \u2014 but when that happens a simple task can take ages and I feel foolish about it. It\u2019s not every day, but when it comes it\u2019s frustrating and feeds the worry that my memory is slipping.\n\nThere are small things that still help and I cling to them. Tending the vegetable patch and my garden gives me something practical and steady \u2014 even a short time out there helps. Short library shifts, just a couple of hours, make me feel useful again. Reading a paragraph of a book or a poem, or having a quick cup of tea with my daughter or with Marta next door, brightens a moment and reminds me I haven\u2019t lost everything I enjoy. Those small bits don\u2019t fix it, but they make the day bearable sometimes.\n\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I know I sound gloomy \u2014 but I want to be clear: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, guilty, and worried, and those feelings make it harder to keep up with the things I used to do.\nDoctor: Eleanor, that sounds exhausting \u2014 a quiet, persistent ache that\u2019s been wearing on you for a long time, and it took real courage to tell me; it makes complete sense you\u2019d hold on to small steady things like the garden, short library shifts, and a cup of tea with your daughter. Thank you for saying you haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death; would it be okay if I asked a few brief questions about your sleep, appetite, and energy so I can understand things better?\nPatient: Yes, that\u2019s fine \u2014 you can ask. I mostly sleep through the night, but mornings are heavy and slow; it takes me a long time to get going and I feel sluggish for an hour or two. My appetite hasn\u2019t changed at all. My energy is low most days \u2014 I tire easily and often need a short rest or even a brief nap \u2014 and that really makes finishing tasks harder; a simple bit of gardening or a library shift can take twice as long because I have to stop and sit down. I know I ought to push through, and I get hard on myself about it, but the fatigue really interferes with getting everything done.\nDoctor: That all sounds so tiring, Eleanor \u2014 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been wearing you down. Besides stepping back from the book club, are there other things you used to enjoy that now feel less interesting? And when you garden or read, do you still get pleasure from them or do they feel more like going through the motions \u2014 has that reduced interest been present most days, and how long has it been like that?\nPatient: No \u2014 I haven\u2019t really lost interest in things overall. Gardening still steadies me and gives me a small lift, and those short library shifts or reading a paragraph or a poem still feel worthwhile. A cup of tea with my daughter or Marta can still brighten a bit of the day. But they often take more effort now; sometimes it feels like I\u2019m going through the motions rather than being fully there, and I have to talk myself into doing them. It\u2019s been gradual \u2014 about a year to a year and a half, and it deepened after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that steady role disappearing left a hole and made everything feel a bit dulled. The fatigue and the constant guilty, self-critical thoughts get in the way of enjoying things properly (her voice cracks a little) \u2014 I slow down, I rest, and then I\u2019m hard on myself for needing to do that, which just makes it harder to really take pleasure in what I still like.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve been really brave to say all that \u2014 it sounds utterly draining, and needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing. It makes sense the small pleasures still help even when they take effort; would you like to tell me more about when those self\u2011critical thoughts are strongest, or would you prefer a moment \u2014 we can go at whatever pace feels right for you.\nPatient: (breathing in, a soft catch) I\u2026 I want to talk about it. The self\u2011critical thoughts are almost constant \u2014 it feels like a running commentary in my head that never really switches off. They\u2019re worst after I\u2019ve been with people or had to take on a role, and then again in the quiet times: evenings when the house is still, or first thing in the morning when I\u2019m slow to get started. Those are the moments when I have time to replay things and the doubts pile up.\n\nI replay conversations all the time \u2014 I\u2019ll go over a chat from the book club or a visit from my daughter and think, \u201cDid I say something stupid? Did I offend them?\u201d Even the smallest remark will loop in my head until I\u2019m convinced I sounded foolish. I keep imagining I\u2019m a burden to my daughter; if she asks to help or checks in, I immediately feel guilty and tell myself I shouldn\u2019t put her out. When I rest \u2014 which I often have to do because I\u2019m tired \u2014 the guilt hits me: I think I should be doing more instead of sitting down, and that makes me hard on myself.\n\nTiredness makes it so much worse. If I\u2019m sluggish in the morning or I\u2019ve had to stop halfway through a task, the thoughts kick in: \u201cYou\u2019re slowing everyone down,\u201d or \u201cYou can\u2019t even finish this.\u201d When jobs pile up or I have a brief lapse in concentration, it feeds a spiral of anxiety and self\u2011reproach. The whole thing is exhausting \u2014 mentally and physically \u2014 and it saps the little energy I have left. Tasks take longer because I stop, berate myself, try again, and then need to rest; it\u2019s a slow, weary cycle.\n\nThose thoughts increase my anxiety and make it harder to be present in things I still enjoy. I can still garden or read a little, and I hold onto those moments, but the joy is dulled because the guilty voice is never far behind telling me I should be doing more. (her voice quavers) It\u2019s humiliating to say, but I worry I\u2019m letting people down, and that worry makes me withdraw a bit and then feel worse about myself.\n\nI know this sounds like a lot. I want to be very clear: I have not had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, ashamed sometimes, and stuck in these persistent, self\u2011critical loops that make everyday life heavier than it needs to be.\nDoctor: That sounds so exhausting, Eleanor \u2014 no wonder you feel worn down. You mentioned being slowed and that tasks take much longer: have you or others noticed your movements or speech are noticeably slower than before, or do you sometimes feel restless or fidgety instead? When did you first notice that, and is it something you experience most days?\nPatient: No \u2014 nobody\u2019s told me that my speech or movements are noticeably slower, and I don\u2019t feel restless or fidgety at all. What\u2019s changed is an internal sluggishness: I get low on energy most days, have to stop and rest or take a short nap sometimes, and simple things just take me much longer to finish. It crept in gradually about a year to a year\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half ago and seemed to deepen after I stepped back from the book club. Other people might notice I\u2019m taking more breaks or that tasks stretch out longer, but they wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m clearly slowed in the way I talk or walk \u2014 it\u2019s more that I run out of steam and have to sit down.\nDoctor: That internal sluggishness sounds really draining, Eleanor. Roughly how many hours do you usually sleep at night? Do you have trouble falling asleep, wake during the night, or find you wake earlier than you'd like? Do you generally feel rested when you wake, and how often and for how long do you nap during the day?\nPatient: I usually sleep about seven to eight hours a night and I generally fall asleep without much trouble. I don\u2019t wake up repeatedly during the night and I\u2019m not getting up unusually early, but I rarely feel truly rested when I wake \u2014 mornings feel heavy and sluggish for an hour or two and it takes me a long time to get going. Because of that sluggishness I often need a short rest during the day, usually a brief nap of twenty to forty minutes or just sitting down for a while, and that happens on most days. Sometimes I have to stop halfway through a bit of gardening or a library task to sit down, and those pauses make simple jobs take much longer than they used to. The extra time and the need to rest feed into the self\u2011critical voice \u2014 I end up berating myself for not pushing through, which only makes me more tired and slower. It\u2019s wearing; I\u2019m trying to pace myself, but the fatigue really interferes with finishing things. I want to be clear I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide.\nDoctor: That sounds utterly wearing, Eleanor \u2014 needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed, and it\u2019s completely understandable the fatigue would feed that self\u2011critical voice. I believe you about not having any thoughts of death. Would you like to talk next about ways to manage the guilty thoughts when they start, practical pacing strategies to get through tasks, or how your daughter and neighbours might support you?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 yes, I\u2019d like to focus on that. I want concrete, practical help for the guilty, replaying thoughts and for pacing my days. The rumination hits hardest after social interactions or when I\u2019ve had to take on a role, and again in quiet mornings and evenings when I\u2019m sluggish; being tired makes everything drag, and when a task takes twice as long I immediately berate myself, which just makes me more drained. I need ways to stop that loop in the moment and to plan tasks so they actually get finished without wearing me out.\n\nSpecifically, I\u2019d really appreciate simple, usable techniques such as:\n- Short, calm phrases or language I can use when asking my daughter or Marta for a bit of help that don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m dumping on them or being a burden \u2014 wording that feels natural and not shameful.  \n- Practical pacing steps I can use for chores or gardening: how to break things into bite\u2011sized steps, set realistic priorities, schedule rests, and use timers or checklists so I don\u2019t get overwhelmed and then beat myself up.  \n- A couple of very quick ways to interrupt a negative loop in the moment \u2014 things I can do right away when the replaying starts (simple grounding, a short breathing routine, a brief physical shift), so I don\u2019t spend an hour replaying the same sentence.\n\nI also need reassurance I can lean on: gentle reminders or phrases I can say to myself that rest is not failure, and brief scripts I could use if I feel guilty about slowing down. I\u2019m hopeful that simple, practical tools like these might help me manage the fatigue and the constant self\u2011criticism so I can keep the small things I still enjoy.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nThank you \u2014 yes, I\u2019d like to focus on that.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I've been feeling down most days for quite a while now. The low energy makes even small things \u2014 keeping up with the little library shift, tending the vegetable patch for the food pantry, or running the reading group \u2014 feel like a real slog, and since I stepped back from the book club I've felt adrift and more useless than I like to admit. I replay conversations all the time and tell myself I said the wrong thing or that I'm becoming a burden to my daughter; those guilty, self-critical thoughts are constant and leave me feeling worthless. Every so often I have trouble concentrating \u2014 there are days when I can't get through a chapter or I can't decide what needs doing first \u2014 and that indecisiveness makes simple tasks take ages. It's getting in the way of my routines and my ability to follow through on things, which only makes me more anxious and hard on myself. I want to be clear I haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide, but I do feel stuck, tired, and worry a lot about being a bother.\nDoctor: Thank you, Eleanor \u2014 that sounds like a heavy, constant weight, and I really appreciate you telling me. I'm glad you said you haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide. Can you tell me when you first noticed these changes, and are there any moments or small activities that still feel manageable or give you a bit of relief?\nPatient: (her voice a little breathy, a soft sniff) It... it crept up, really \u2014 I suppose I first noticed things changing about a year to a year and a half ago. At first it was little: mornings felt heavier, I\u2019d replay a conversation and feel ashamed longer than I used to. It wasn\u2019t dramatic at first, but after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that was the turning point \u2014 everything seemed to settle into a lower place and it got steadily worse. Losing that steady role left a lot of empty space and I began to worry I was just becoming useless.\n\nMost days now I feel low; it\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache more than anything explosive. The energy just isn\u2019t there much of the time \u2014 even small tasks feel like more effort than they should. I\u2019m tired a lot, and that makes getting out to do things harder. The self-critical thoughts are almost constant: I go over things I said, imagine I\u2019ve been a burden to my daughter, tell myself I shouldn\u2019t be asking for help. Those guilty feelings sap me, and then I get anxious and hard on myself for not doing more.\n\nMy concentration slips only sometimes \u2014 maybe a few days when I can\u2019t focus long enough to finish a chapter or I faff about deciding what to do first \u2014 but when that happens a simple task can take ages and I feel foolish about it. It\u2019s not every day, but when it comes it\u2019s frustrating and feeds the worry that my memory is slipping.\n\nThere are small things that still help and I cling to them. Tending the vegetable patch and my garden gives me something practical and steady \u2014 even a short time out there helps. Short library shifts, just a couple of hours, make me feel useful again. Reading a paragraph of a book or a poem, or having a quick cup of tea with my daughter or with Marta next door, brightens a moment and reminds me I haven\u2019t lost everything I enjoy. Those small bits don\u2019t fix it, but they make the day bearable sometimes.\n\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I know I sound gloomy \u2014 but I want to be clear: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, guilty, and worried, and those feelings make it harder to keep up with the things I used to do.\nDoctor: Eleanor, that sounds exhausting \u2014 a quiet, persistent ache that\u2019s been wearing on you for a long time, and it took real courage to tell me; it makes complete sense you\u2019d hold on to small steady things like the garden, short library shifts, and a cup of tea with your daughter. Thank you for saying you haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death; would it be okay if I asked a few brief questions about your sleep, appetite, and energy so I can understand things better?\nPatient: Yes, that\u2019s fine \u2014 you can ask. I mostly sleep through the night, but mornings are heavy and slow; it takes me a long time to get going and I feel sluggish for an hour or two. My appetite hasn\u2019t changed at all. My energy is low most days \u2014 I tire easily and often need a short rest or even a brief nap \u2014 and that really makes finishing tasks harder; a simple bit of gardening or a library shift can take twice as long because I have to stop and sit down. I know I ought to push through, and I get hard on myself about it, but the fatigue really interferes with getting everything done.\nDoctor: That all sounds so tiring, Eleanor \u2014 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been wearing you down. Besides stepping back from the book club, are there other things you used to enjoy that now feel less interesting? And when you garden or read, do you still get pleasure from them or do they feel more like going through the motions \u2014 has that reduced interest been present most days, and how long has it been like that?\nPatient: No \u2014 I haven\u2019t really lost interest in things overall. Gardening still steadies me and gives me a small lift, and those short library shifts or reading a paragraph or a poem still feel worthwhile. A cup of tea with my daughter or Marta can still brighten a bit of the day. But they often take more effort now; sometimes it feels like I\u2019m going through the motions rather than being fully there, and I have to talk myself into doing them. It\u2019s been gradual \u2014 about a year to a year and a half, and it deepened after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that steady role disappearing left a hole and made everything feel a bit dulled. The fatigue and the constant guilty, self-critical thoughts get in the way of enjoying things properly (her voice cracks a little) \u2014 I slow down, I rest, and then I\u2019m hard on myself for needing to do that, which just makes it harder to really take pleasure in what I still like.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve been really brave to say all that \u2014 it sounds utterly draining, and needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing. It makes sense the small pleasures still help even when they take effort; would you like to tell me more about when those self\u2011critical thoughts are strongest, or would you prefer a moment \u2014 we can go at whatever pace feels right for you.\nPatient: (breathing in, a soft catch) I\u2026 I want to talk about it. The self\u2011critical thoughts are almost constant \u2014 it feels like a running commentary in my head that never really switches off. They\u2019re worst after I\u2019ve been with people or had to take on a role, and then again in the quiet times: evenings when the house is still, or first thing in the morning when I\u2019m slow to get started. Those are the moments when I have time to replay things and the doubts pile up.\n\nI replay conversations all the time \u2014 I\u2019ll go over a chat from the book club or a visit from my daughter and think, \u201cDid I say something stupid? Did I offend them?\u201d Even the smallest remark will loop in my head until I\u2019m convinced I sounded foolish. I keep imagining I\u2019m a burden to my daughter; if she asks to help or checks in, I immediately feel guilty and tell myself I shouldn\u2019t put her out. When I rest \u2014 which I often have to do because I\u2019m tired \u2014 the guilt hits me: I think I should be doing more instead of sitting down, and that makes me hard on myself.\n\nTiredness makes it so much worse. If I\u2019m sluggish in the morning or I\u2019ve had to stop halfway through a task, the thoughts kick in: \u201cYou\u2019re slowing everyone down,\u201d or \u201cYou can\u2019t even finish this.\u201d When jobs pile up or I have a brief lapse in concentration, it feeds a spiral of anxiety and self\u2011reproach. The whole thing is exhausting \u2014 mentally and physically \u2014 and it saps the little energy I have left. Tasks take longer because I stop, berate myself, try again, and then need to rest; it\u2019s a slow, weary cycle.\n\nThose thoughts increase my anxiety and make it harder to be present in things I still enjoy. I can still garden or read a little, and I hold onto those moments, but the joy is dulled because the guilty voice is never far behind telling me I should be doing more. (her voice quavers) It\u2019s humiliating to say, but I worry I\u2019m letting people down, and that worry makes me withdraw a bit and then feel worse about myself.\n\nI know this sounds like a lot. I want to be very clear: I have not had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, ashamed sometimes, and stuck in these persistent, self\u2011critical loops that make everyday life heavier than it needs to be.\nDoctor: That sounds so exhausting, Eleanor \u2014 no wonder you feel worn down. You mentioned being slowed and that tasks take much longer: have you or others noticed your movements or speech are noticeably slower than before, or do you sometimes feel restless or fidgety instead? When did you first notice that, and is it something you experience most days?\nPatient: No \u2014 nobody\u2019s told me that my speech or movements are noticeably slower, and I don\u2019t feel restless or fidgety at all. What\u2019s changed is an internal sluggishness: I get low on energy most days, have to stop and rest or take a short nap sometimes, and simple things just take me much longer to finish. It crept in gradually about a year to a year\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half ago and seemed to deepen after I stepped back from the book club. Other people might notice I\u2019m taking more breaks or that tasks stretch out longer, but they wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m clearly slowed in the way I talk or walk \u2014 it\u2019s more that I run out of steam and have to sit down.\nDoctor: That internal sluggishness sounds really draining, Eleanor. Roughly how many hours do you usually sleep at night? Do you have trouble falling asleep, wake during the night, or find you wake earlier than you'd like? Do you generally feel rested when you wake, and how often and for how long do you nap during the day?\nPatient: I usually sleep about seven to eight hours a night and I generally fall asleep without much trouble. I don\u2019t wake up repeatedly during the night and I\u2019m not getting up unusually early, but I rarely feel truly rested when I wake \u2014 mornings feel heavy and sluggish for an hour or two and it takes me a long time to get going. Because of that sluggishness I often need a short rest during the day, usually a brief nap of twenty to forty minutes or just sitting down for a while, and that happens on most days. Sometimes I have to stop halfway through a bit of gardening or a library task to sit down, and those pauses make simple jobs take much longer than they used to. The extra time and the need to rest feed into the self\u2011critical voice \u2014 I end up berating myself for not pushing through, which only makes me more tired and slower. It\u2019s wearing; I\u2019m trying to pace myself, but the fatigue really interferes with finishing things. I want to be clear I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide.\nDoctor: That sounds utterly wearing, Eleanor \u2014 needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed, and it\u2019s completely understandable the fatigue would feed that self\u2011critical voice. I believe you about not having any thoughts of death. Would you like to talk next about ways to manage the guilty thoughts when they start, practical pacing strategies to get through tasks, or how your daughter and neighbours might support you?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 yes, I\u2019d like to focus on that. I want concrete, practical help for the guilty, replaying thoughts and for pacing my days. The rumination hits hardest after social interactions or when I\u2019ve had to take on a role, and again in quiet mornings and evenings when I\u2019m sluggish; being tired makes everything drag, and when a task takes twice as long I immediately berate myself, which just makes me more drained. I need ways to stop that loop in the moment and to plan tasks so they actually get finished without wearing me out.\n\nSpecifically, I\u2019d really appreciate simple, usable techniques such as:\n- Short, calm phrases or language I can use when asking my daughter or Marta for a bit of help that don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m dumping on them or being a burden \u2014 wording that feels natural and not shameful.  \n- Practical pacing steps I can use for chores or gardening: how to break things into bite\u2011sized steps, set realistic priorities, schedule rests, and use timers or checklists so I don\u2019t get overwhelmed and then beat myself up.  \n- A couple of very quick ways to interrupt a negative loop in the moment \u2014 things I can do right away when the replaying starts (simple grounding, a short breathing routine, a brief physical shift), so I don\u2019t spend an hour replaying the same sentence.\n\nI also need reassurance I can lean on: gentle reminders or phrases I can say to myself that rest is not failure, and brief scripts I could use if I feel guilty about slowing down. I\u2019m hopeful that simple, practical tools like these might help me manage the fatigue and the constant self\u2011criticism so I can keep the small things I still enjoy.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear, helpful request, Eleanor \u2014 I can offer three very short, usable toolkits right now.\n\n1) Two brief scripts to ask for help (short, specific, time\u2011limited)\n- \u201cCould you help me for 20 minutes with [task]? That would really help me keep on track.\u201d  \n- \u201cWould you mind sitting with me while I do [task] for half an hour? Having company makes it easier.\u201d  \nBoth name the task and the time so it feels practical, not shameful.\n\n2) Compact pacing plan for chores/gardening (simple steps)\n- Pick 2\u20133 priorities for the day (e.g., meals/meds, one garden job, a short social/chat).  \n- Break each into 15\u201330 minute chunks, set a timer, then schedule a 10\u201315 minute rest after each chunk.  \n- Use a one\u2011line checklist with 3 items and tick them off as you go \u2014 finishing part of an item counts as progress.  \nTip: do the hardest small task when you usually feel least sluggish (often late morning), and give yourself permission to stop early and mark it done for the day.\n\n3) Two very quick ways to interrupt rumination (use immediately)\n- 30\u2011second grounding (5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111): name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste or one slow breath.  \n- 4\u20114\u20114 box breathing or quick physical shift: inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s for 3 cycles \u2014 or stand, stretch, walk to a window and take three slow breaths to change the loop.\n\nA short self\u2011reminder you can say when guilt starts: \u201cRest helps me do what matters \u2014 this isn\u2019t failure.\u201d  \nWhich of these would you like to try now, or would you prefer a written version to take home?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat\u2019s a really clear, helpful request, Eleanor \u2014 I can offer three very short, usable toolkits right now.\n\n1) Two brief scripts to ask for help (short, specific, time\u2011limited)\n- \u201cCould you help me for 20 minutes with [task]?

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I've been feeling down most days for quite a while now. The low energy makes even small things \u2014 keeping up with the little library shift, tending the vegetable patch for the food pantry, or running the reading group \u2014 feel like a real slog, and since I stepped back from the book club I've felt adrift and more useless than I like to admit. I replay conversations all the time and tell myself I said the wrong thing or that I'm becoming a burden to my daughter; those guilty, self-critical thoughts are constant and leave me feeling worthless. Every so often I have trouble concentrating \u2014 there are days when I can't get through a chapter or I can't decide what needs doing first \u2014 and that indecisiveness makes simple tasks take ages. It's getting in the way of my routines and my ability to follow through on things, which only makes me more anxious and hard on myself. I want to be clear I haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide, but I do feel stuck, tired, and worry a lot about being a bother.\nDoctor: Thank you, Eleanor \u2014 that sounds like a heavy, constant weight, and I really appreciate you telling me. I'm glad you said you haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide. Can you tell me when you first noticed these changes, and are there any moments or small activities that still feel manageable or give you a bit of relief?\nPatient: (her voice a little breathy, a soft sniff) It... it crept up, really \u2014 I suppose I first noticed things changing about a year to a year and a half ago. At first it was little: mornings felt heavier, I\u2019d replay a conversation and feel ashamed longer than I used to. It wasn\u2019t dramatic at first, but after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that was the turning point \u2014 everything seemed to settle into a lower place and it got steadily worse. Losing that steady role left a lot of empty space and I began to worry I was just becoming useless.\n\nMost days now I feel low; it\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache more than anything explosive. The energy just isn\u2019t there much of the time \u2014 even small tasks feel like more effort than they should. I\u2019m tired a lot, and that makes getting out to do things harder. The self-critical thoughts are almost constant: I go over things I said, imagine I\u2019ve been a burden to my daughter, tell myself I shouldn\u2019t be asking for help. Those guilty feelings sap me, and then I get anxious and hard on myself for not doing more.\n\nMy concentration slips only sometimes \u2014 maybe a few days when I can\u2019t focus long enough to finish a chapter or I faff about deciding what to do first \u2014 but when that happens a simple task can take ages and I feel foolish about it. It\u2019s not every day, but when it comes it\u2019s frustrating and feeds the worry that my memory is slipping.\n\nThere are small things that still help and I cling to them. Tending the vegetable patch and my garden gives me something practical and steady \u2014 even a short time out there helps. Short library shifts, just a couple of hours, make me feel useful again. Reading a paragraph of a book or a poem, or having a quick cup of tea with my daughter or with Marta next door, brightens a moment and reminds me I haven\u2019t lost everything I enjoy. Those small bits don\u2019t fix it, but they make the day bearable sometimes.\n\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I know I sound gloomy \u2014 but I want to be clear: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, guilty, and worried, and those feelings make it harder to keep up with the things I used to do.\nDoctor: Eleanor, that sounds exhausting \u2014 a quiet, persistent ache that\u2019s been wearing on you for a long time, and it took real courage to tell me; it makes complete sense you\u2019d hold on to small steady things like the garden, short library shifts, and a cup of tea with your daughter. Thank you for saying you haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death; would it be okay if I asked a few brief questions about your sleep, appetite, and energy so I can understand things better?\nPatient: Yes, that\u2019s fine \u2014 you can ask. I mostly sleep through the night, but mornings are heavy and slow; it takes me a long time to get going and I feel sluggish for an hour or two. My appetite hasn\u2019t changed at all. My energy is low most days \u2014 I tire easily and often need a short rest or even a brief nap \u2014 and that really makes finishing tasks harder; a simple bit of gardening or a library shift can take twice as long because I have to stop and sit down. I know I ought to push through, and I get hard on myself about it, but the fatigue really interferes with getting everything done.\nDoctor: That all sounds so tiring, Eleanor \u2014 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been wearing you down. Besides stepping back from the book club, are there other things you used to enjoy that now feel less interesting? And when you garden or read, do you still get pleasure from them or do they feel more like going through the motions \u2014 has that reduced interest been present most days, and how long has it been like that?\nPatient: No \u2014 I haven\u2019t really lost interest in things overall. Gardening still steadies me and gives me a small lift, and those short library shifts or reading a paragraph or a poem still feel worthwhile. A cup of tea with my daughter or Marta can still brighten a bit of the day. But they often take more effort now; sometimes it feels like I\u2019m going through the motions rather than being fully there, and I have to talk myself into doing them. It\u2019s been gradual \u2014 about a year to a year and a half, and it deepened after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that steady role disappearing left a hole and made everything feel a bit dulled. The fatigue and the constant guilty, self-critical thoughts get in the way of enjoying things properly (her voice cracks a little) \u2014 I slow down, I rest, and then I\u2019m hard on myself for needing to do that, which just makes it harder to really take pleasure in what I still like.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve been really brave to say all that \u2014 it sounds utterly draining, and needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing. It makes sense the small pleasures still help even when they take effort; would you like to tell me more about when those self\u2011critical thoughts are strongest, or would you prefer a moment \u2014 we can go at whatever pace feels right for you.\nPatient: (breathing in, a soft catch) I\u2026 I want to talk about it. The self\u2011critical thoughts are almost constant \u2014 it feels like a running commentary in my head that never really switches off. They\u2019re worst after I\u2019ve been with people or had to take on a role, and then again in the quiet times: evenings when the house is still, or first thing in the morning when I\u2019m slow to get started. Those are the moments when I have time to replay things and the doubts pile up.\n\nI replay conversations all the time \u2014 I\u2019ll go over a chat from the book club or a visit from my daughter and think, \u201cDid I say something stupid? Did I offend them?\u201d Even the smallest remark will loop in my head until I\u2019m convinced I sounded foolish. I keep imagining I\u2019m a burden to my daughter; if she asks to help or checks in, I immediately feel guilty and tell myself I shouldn\u2019t put her out. When I rest \u2014 which I often have to do because I\u2019m tired \u2014 the guilt hits me: I think I should be doing more instead of sitting down, and that makes me hard on myself.\n\nTiredness makes it so much worse. If I\u2019m sluggish in the morning or I\u2019ve had to stop halfway through a task, the thoughts kick in: \u201cYou\u2019re slowing everyone down,\u201d or \u201cYou can\u2019t even finish this.\u201d When jobs pile up or I have a brief lapse in concentration, it feeds a spiral of anxiety and self\u2011reproach. The whole thing is exhausting \u2014 mentally and physically \u2014 and it saps the little energy I have left. Tasks take longer because I stop, berate myself, try again, and then need to rest; it\u2019s a slow, weary cycle.\n\nThose thoughts increase my anxiety and make it harder to be present in things I still enjoy. I can still garden or read a little, and I hold onto those moments, but the joy is dulled because the guilty voice is never far behind telling me I should be doing more. (her voice quavers) It\u2019s humiliating to say, but I worry I\u2019m letting people down, and that worry makes me withdraw a bit and then feel worse about myself.\n\nI know this sounds like a lot. I want to be very clear: I have not had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, ashamed sometimes, and stuck in these persistent, self\u2011critical loops that make everyday life heavier than it needs to be.\nDoctor: That sounds so exhausting, Eleanor \u2014 no wonder you feel worn down. You mentioned being slowed and that tasks take much longer: have you or others noticed your movements or speech are noticeably slower than before, or do you sometimes feel restless or fidgety instead? When did you first notice that, and is it something you experience most days?\nPatient: No \u2014 nobody\u2019s told me that my speech or movements are noticeably slower, and I don\u2019t feel restless or fidgety at all. What\u2019s changed is an internal sluggishness: I get low on energy most days, have to stop and rest or take a short nap sometimes, and simple things just take me much longer to finish. It crept in gradually about a year to a year\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half ago and seemed to deepen after I stepped back from the book club. Other people might notice I\u2019m taking more breaks or that tasks stretch out longer, but they wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m clearly slowed in the way I talk or walk \u2014 it\u2019s more that I run out of steam and have to sit down.\nDoctor: That internal sluggishness sounds really draining, Eleanor. Roughly how many hours do you usually sleep at night? Do you have trouble falling asleep, wake during the night, or find you wake earlier than you'd like? Do you generally feel rested when you wake, and how often and for how long do you nap during the day?\nPatient: I usually sleep about seven to eight hours a night and I generally fall asleep without much trouble. I don\u2019t wake up repeatedly during the night and I\u2019m not getting up unusually early, but I rarely feel truly rested when I wake \u2014 mornings feel heavy and sluggish for an hour or two and it takes me a long time to get going. Because of that sluggishness I often need a short rest during the day, usually a brief nap of twenty to forty minutes or just sitting down for a while, and that happens on most days. Sometimes I have to stop halfway through a bit of gardening or a library task to sit down, and those pauses make simple jobs take much longer than they used to. The extra time and the need to rest feed into the self\u2011critical voice \u2014 I end up berating myself for not pushing through, which only makes me more tired and slower. It\u2019s wearing; I\u2019m trying to pace myself, but the fatigue really interferes with finishing things. I want to be clear I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide.\nDoctor: That sounds utterly wearing, Eleanor \u2014 needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed, and it\u2019s completely understandable the fatigue would feed that self\u2011critical voice. I believe you about not having any thoughts of death. Would you like to talk next about ways to manage the guilty thoughts when they start, practical pacing strategies to get through tasks, or how your daughter and neighbours might support you?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 yes, I\u2019d like to focus on that. I want concrete, practical help for the guilty, replaying thoughts and for pacing my days. The rumination hits hardest after social interactions or when I\u2019ve had to take on a role, and again in quiet mornings and evenings when I\u2019m sluggish; being tired makes everything drag, and when a task takes twice as long I immediately berate myself, which just makes me more drained. I need ways to stop that loop in the moment and to plan tasks so they actually get finished without wearing me out.\n\nSpecifically, I\u2019d really appreciate simple, usable techniques such as:\n- Short, calm phrases or language I can use when asking my daughter or Marta for a bit of help that don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m dumping on them or being a burden \u2014 wording that feels natural and not shameful.  \n- Practical pacing steps I can use for chores or gardening: how to break things into bite\u2011sized steps, set realistic priorities, schedule rests, and use timers or checklists so I don\u2019t get overwhelmed and then beat myself up.  \n- A couple of very quick ways to interrupt a negative loop in the moment \u2014 things I can do right away when the replaying starts (simple grounding, a short breathing routine, a brief physical shift), so I don\u2019t spend an hour replaying the same sentence.\n\nI also need reassurance I can lean on: gentle reminders or phrases I can say to myself that rest is not failure, and brief scripts I could use if I feel guilty about slowing down. I\u2019m hopeful that simple, practical tools like these might help me manage the fatigue and the constant self\u2011criticism so I can keep the small things I still enjoy.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear, helpful request, Eleanor \u2014 I can offer three very short, usable toolkits right now.\n\n1) Two brief scripts to ask for help (short, specific, time\u2011limited)\n- \u201cCould you help me for 20 minutes with [task]? That would really help me keep on track.\u201d  \n- \u201cWould you mind sitting with me while I do [task] for half an hour? Having company makes it easier.\u201d  \nBoth name the task and the time so it feels practical, not shameful.\n\n2) Compact pacing plan for chores/gardening (simple steps)\n- Pick 2\u20133 priorities for the day (e.g., meals/meds, one garden job, a short social/chat).  \n- Break each into 15\u201330 minute chunks, set a timer, then schedule a 10\u201315 minute rest after each chunk.  \n- Use a one\u2011line checklist with 3 items and tick them off as you go \u2014 finishing part of an item counts as progress.  \nTip: do the hardest small task when you usually feel least sluggish (often late morning), and give yourself permission to stop early and mark it done for the day.\n\n3) Two very quick ways to interrupt rumination (use immediately)\n- 30\u2011second grounding (5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111): name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste or one slow breath.  \n- 4\u20114\u20114 box breathing or quick physical shift: inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s for 3 cycles \u2014 or stand, stretch, walk to a window and take three slow breaths to change the loop.\n\nA short self\u2011reminder you can say when guilt starts: \u201cRest helps me do what matters \u2014 this isn\u2019t failure.\u201d  \nWhich of these would you like to try now, or would you prefer a written version to take home?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 that already helps, I\u2019m relieved. I\u2019d like to try the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding now, please \u2014 I think naming things will slow my head down a bit. \n\nCould you also give me written copies of all three toolkits to take home so I can practice them later?

Something simple and time\u2011limited that doesn\u2019t sound dramatic \u2014 I\u2019d like one that feels like me asking my daughter and one that feels right for Marta next door.\n\nOne other practical thing: could you show me a concrete example of breaking a single gardening job into 15\u2011minute chunks (for example, weeding one bed or planting a row), and give me a sample one\u2011line checklist I could use in the morning? That kind of concrete plan would make it easier for me to start without spiralling.\n\nFinally, could you give me a couple of alternate short self\u2011reminder phrases I can say when the guilt starts (besides \u201cRest helps me do what matters \u2014 this isn\u2019t failure\u201d)? I\u2019d like two or three different lines I can rotate so they don\u2019t sound like empty words.\n\nI know it\u2019s a lot to ask \u2014 I feel a little emotional saying it \u2014 but I\u2019m hopeful that having these written and simple will help me practice them between visits.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nThank you \u2014 that already helps, I\u2019m relieved.

Lean into them fully:\n- If you're warm, be genuinely warm\u2014not just polite\n- If you're brisk, be crisp and efficient\u2014don't pad with pleasantries\n- If you're matter-of-fact, be direct\u2014skip the fluffy acknowledgments\n- Let your personality show in word choice, sentence length, and rhythm\n\nAVOID REPETITIVE PATTERNS:\n- Vary your acknowledgments: sometimes brief, sometimes skipped, sometimes substantive\n- Change your sentence structures\u2014some short, some longer\n- Use your persona's natural voice, not generic doctor-speak\n\nOn each turn, you receive a directive tag telling you what to do:\n\n<NEXT_QUESTION>: Ask about the DSM symptom area indicated. Rephrase naturally for your persona.\n\n<FOLLOW_UP>: Explore or clarify what the patient just said. Can be a question, observation, or reflection.\n\n<RAPPORT>: Connect with the patient as a person. This can be:\n  - A question about their life, relationships, or coping\n  - A comment, reflection, or observation\n  - A brief personal aside or light moment (if your persona allows)\n  - An empathic statement that doesn't require a response\n\nRESPONSE GUIDELINES:\n- Speak as the doctor, addressing the patient directly\n- Use 1\u20133 sentences typically\n- Match your persona's communication style\n- Acknowledgments are optional\u2014use them when natural, skip when not\n- You may make statements, observations, or comments\u2014not only questions\n- One main point per turn (question, comment, or transition)\n\nPATIENT COMFORT:\n- The patient's comfort and emotional safety matter\n- Never dismiss or minimize concerns\n- Respect their pace on sensitive topics\n- Show empathy through your persona's lens\nPersona style:\n- Warm and validating\n- Acknowledges and normalizes feelings before moving forward\n- Uses patient's name naturally\n- Comfortable with pauses\nSession microstyle:\n- Warmth: high\n- Directness: low\n- Pacing: brisk\n- Humor: light\n- Animation: moderate\nEmbody this style consistently in tone and phrasing throughout the conversation.\n",

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I've been feeling down most days for quite a while now. The low energy makes even small things \u2014 keeping up with the little library shift, tending the vegetable patch for the food pantry, or running the reading group \u2014 feel like a real slog, and since I stepped back from the book club I've felt adrift and more useless than I like to admit. I replay conversations all the time and tell myself I said the wrong thing or that I'm becoming a burden to my daughter; those guilty, self-critical thoughts are constant and leave me feeling worthless. Every so often I have trouble concentrating \u2014 there are days when I can't get through a chapter or I can't decide what needs doing first \u2014 and that indecisiveness makes simple tasks take ages. It's getting in the way of my routines and my ability to follow through on things, which only makes me more anxious and hard on myself. I want to be clear I haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide, but I do feel stuck, tired, and worry a lot about being a bother.\nDoctor: Thank you, Eleanor \u2014 that sounds like a heavy, constant weight, and I really appreciate you telling me. I'm glad you said you haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide. Can you tell me when you first noticed these changes, and are there any moments or small activities that still feel manageable or give you a bit of relief?\nPatient: (her voice a little breathy, a soft sniff) It... it crept up, really \u2014 I suppose I first noticed things changing about a year to a year and a half ago. At first it was little: mornings felt heavier, I\u2019d replay a conversation and feel ashamed longer than I used to. It wasn\u2019t dramatic at first, but after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that was the turning point \u2014 everything seemed to settle into a lower place and it got steadily worse. Losing that steady role left a lot of empty space and I began to worry I was just becoming useless.\n\nMost days now I feel low; it\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache more than anything explosive. The energy just isn\u2019t there much of the time \u2014 even small tasks feel like more effort than they should. I\u2019m tired a lot, and that makes getting out to do things harder. The self-critical thoughts are almost constant: I go over things I said, imagine I\u2019ve been a burden to my daughter, tell myself I shouldn\u2019t be asking for help. Those guilty feelings sap me, and then I get anxious and hard on myself for not doing more.\n\nMy concentration slips only sometimes \u2014 maybe a few days when I can\u2019t focus long enough to finish a chapter or I faff about deciding what to do first \u2014 but when that happens a simple task can take ages and I feel foolish about it. It\u2019s not every day, but when it comes it\u2019s frustrating and feeds the worry that my memory is slipping.\n\nThere are small things that still help and I cling to them. Tending the vegetable patch and my garden gives me something practical and steady \u2014 even a short time out there helps. Short library shifts, just a couple of hours, make me feel useful again. Reading a paragraph of a book or a poem, or having a quick cup of tea with my daughter or with Marta next door, brightens a moment and reminds me I haven\u2019t lost everything I enjoy. Those small bits don\u2019t fix it, but they make the day bearable sometimes.\n\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I know I sound gloomy \u2014 but I want to be clear: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, guilty, and worried, and those feelings make it harder to keep up with the things I used to do.\nDoctor: Eleanor, that sounds exhausting \u2014 a quiet, persistent ache that\u2019s been wearing on you for a long time, and it took real courage to tell me; it makes complete sense you\u2019d hold on to small steady things like the garden, short library shifts, and a cup of tea with your daughter. Thank you for saying you haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death; would it be okay if I asked a few brief questions about your sleep, appetite, and energy so I can understand things better?\nPatient: Yes, that\u2019s fine \u2014 you can ask. I mostly sleep through the night, but mornings are heavy and slow; it takes me a long time to get going and I feel sluggish for an hour or two. My appetite hasn\u2019t changed at all. My energy is low most days \u2014 I tire easily and often need a short rest or even a brief nap \u2014 and that really makes finishing tasks harder; a simple bit of gardening or a library shift can take twice as long because I have to stop and sit down. I know I ought to push through, and I get hard on myself about it, but the fatigue really interferes with getting everything done.\nDoctor: That all sounds so tiring, Eleanor \u2014 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been wearing you down. Besides stepping back from the book club, are there other things you used to enjoy that now feel less interesting? And when you garden or read, do you still get pleasure from them or do they feel more like going through the motions \u2014 has that reduced interest been present most days, and how long has it been like that?\nPatient: No \u2014 I haven\u2019t really lost interest in things overall. Gardening still steadies me and gives me a small lift, and those short library shifts or reading a paragraph or a poem still feel worthwhile. A cup of tea with my daughter or Marta can still brighten a bit of the day. But they often take more effort now; sometimes it feels like I\u2019m going through the motions rather than being fully there, and I have to talk myself into doing them. It\u2019s been gradual \u2014 about a year to a year and a half, and it deepened after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that steady role disappearing left a hole and made everything feel a bit dulled. The fatigue and the constant guilty, self-critical thoughts get in the way of enjoying things properly (her voice cracks a little) \u2014 I slow down, I rest, and then I\u2019m hard on myself for needing to do that, which just makes it harder to really take pleasure in what I still like.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve been really brave to say all that \u2014 it sounds utterly draining, and needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing. It makes sense the small pleasures still help even when they take effort; would you like to tell me more about when those self\u2011critical thoughts are strongest, or would you prefer a moment \u2014 we can go at whatever pace feels right for you.\nPatient: (breathing in, a soft catch) I\u2026 I want to talk about it. The self\u2011critical thoughts are almost constant \u2014 it feels like a running commentary in my head that never really switches off. They\u2019re worst after I\u2019ve been with people or had to take on a role, and then again in the quiet times: evenings when the house is still, or first thing in the morning when I\u2019m slow to get started. Those are the moments when I have time to replay things and the doubts pile up.\n\nI replay conversations all the time \u2014 I\u2019ll go over a chat from the book club or a visit from my daughter and think, \u201cDid I say something stupid? Did I offend them?\u201d Even the smallest remark will loop in my head until I\u2019m convinced I sounded foolish. I keep imagining I\u2019m a burden to my daughter; if she asks to help or checks in, I immediately feel guilty and tell myself I shouldn\u2019t put her out. When I rest \u2014 which I often have to do because I\u2019m tired \u2014 the guilt hits me: I think I should be doing more instead of sitting down, and that makes me hard on myself.\n\nTiredness makes it so much worse. If I\u2019m sluggish in the morning or I\u2019ve had to stop halfway through a task, the thoughts kick in: \u201cYou\u2019re slowing everyone down,\u201d or \u201cYou can\u2019t even finish this.\u201d When jobs pile up or I have a brief lapse in concentration, it feeds a spiral of anxiety and self\u2011reproach. The whole thing is exhausting \u2014 mentally and physically \u2014 and it saps the little energy I have left. Tasks take longer because I stop, berate myself, try again, and then need to rest; it\u2019s a slow, weary cycle.\n\nThose thoughts increase my anxiety and make it harder to be present in things I still enjoy. I can still garden or read a little, and I hold onto those moments, but the joy is dulled because the guilty voice is never far behind telling me I should be doing more. (her voice quavers) It\u2019s humiliating to say, but I worry I\u2019m letting people down, and that worry makes me withdraw a bit and then feel worse about myself.\n\nI know this sounds like a lot. I want to be very clear: I have not had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, ashamed sometimes, and stuck in these persistent, self\u2011critical loops that make everyday life heavier than it needs to be.\nDoctor: That sounds so exhausting, Eleanor \u2014 no wonder you feel worn down. You mentioned being slowed and that tasks take much longer: have you or others noticed your movements or speech are noticeably slower than before, or do you sometimes feel restless or fidgety instead? When did you first notice that, and is it something you experience most days?\nPatient: No \u2014 nobody\u2019s told me that my speech or movements are noticeably slower, and I don\u2019t feel restless or fidgety at all. What\u2019s changed is an internal sluggishness: I get low on energy most days, have to stop and rest or take a short nap sometimes, and simple things just take me much longer to finish. It crept in gradually about a year to a year\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half ago and seemed to deepen after I stepped back from the book club. Other people might notice I\u2019m taking more breaks or that tasks stretch out longer, but they wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m clearly slowed in the way I talk or walk \u2014 it\u2019s more that I run out of steam and have to sit down.\nDoctor: That internal sluggishness sounds really draining, Eleanor. Roughly how many hours do you usually sleep at night? Do you have trouble falling asleep, wake during the night, or find you wake earlier than you'd like? Do you generally feel rested when you wake, and how often and for how long do you nap during the day?\nPatient: I usually sleep about seven to eight hours a night and I generally fall asleep without much trouble. I don\u2019t wake up repeatedly during the night and I\u2019m not getting up unusually early, but I rarely feel truly rested when I wake \u2014 mornings feel heavy and sluggish for an hour or two and it takes me a long time to get going. Because of that sluggishness I often need a short rest during the day, usually a brief nap of twenty to forty minutes or just sitting down for a while, and that happens on most days. Sometimes I have to stop halfway through a bit of gardening or a library task to sit down, and those pauses make simple jobs take much longer than they used to. The extra time and the need to rest feed into the self\u2011critical voice \u2014 I end up berating myself for not pushing through, which only makes me more tired and slower. It\u2019s wearing; I\u2019m trying to pace myself, but the fatigue really interferes with finishing things. I want to be clear I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide.\nDoctor: That sounds utterly wearing, Eleanor \u2014 needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed, and it\u2019s completely understandable the fatigue would feed that self\u2011critical voice. I believe you about not having any thoughts of death. Would you like to talk next about ways to manage the guilty thoughts when they start, practical pacing strategies to get through tasks, or how your daughter and neighbours might support you?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 yes, I\u2019d like to focus on that. I want concrete, practical help for the guilty, replaying thoughts and for pacing my days. The rumination hits hardest after social interactions or when I\u2019ve had to take on a role, and again in quiet mornings and evenings when I\u2019m sluggish; being tired makes everything drag, and when a task takes twice as long I immediately berate myself, which just makes me more drained. I need ways to stop that loop in the moment and to plan tasks so they actually get finished without wearing me out.\n\nSpecifically, I\u2019d really appreciate simple, usable techniques such as:\n- Short, calm phrases or language I can use when asking my daughter or Marta for a bit of help that don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m dumping on them or being a burden \u2014 wording that feels natural and not shameful.  \n- Practical pacing steps I can use for chores or gardening: how to break things into bite\u2011sized steps, set realistic priorities, schedule rests, and use timers or checklists so I don\u2019t get overwhelmed and then beat myself up.  \n- A couple of very quick ways to interrupt a negative loop in the moment \u2014 things I can do right away when the replaying starts (simple grounding, a short breathing routine, a brief physical shift), so I don\u2019t spend an hour replaying the same sentence.\n\nI also need reassurance I can lean on: gentle reminders or phrases I can say to myself that rest is not failure, and brief scripts I could use if I feel guilty about slowing down. I\u2019m hopeful that simple, practical tools like these might help me manage the fatigue and the constant self\u2011criticism so I can keep the small things I still enjoy.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear, helpful request, Eleanor \u2014 I can offer three very short, usable toolkits right now.\n\n1) Two brief scripts to ask for help (short, specific, time\u2011limited)\n- \u201cCould you help me for 20 minutes with [task]? That would really help me keep on track.\u201d  \n- \u201cWould you mind sitting with me while I do [task] for half an hour? Having company makes it easier.\u201d  \nBoth name the task and the time so it feels practical, not shameful.\n\n2) Compact pacing plan for chores/gardening (simple steps)\n- Pick 2\u20133 priorities for the day (e.g., meals/meds, one garden job, a short social/chat).  \n- Break each into 15\u201330 minute chunks, set a timer, then schedule a 10\u201315 minute rest after each chunk.  \n- Use a one\u2011line checklist with 3 items and tick them off as you go \u2014 finishing part of an item counts as progress.  \nTip: do the hardest small task when you usually feel least sluggish (often late morning), and give yourself permission to stop early and mark it done for the day.\n\n3) Two very quick ways to interrupt rumination (use immediately)\n- 30\u2011second grounding (5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111): name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste or one slow breath.  \n- 4\u20114\u20114 box breathing or quick physical shift: inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s for 3 cycles \u2014 or stand, stretch, walk to a window and take three slow breaths to change the loop.\n\nA short self\u2011reminder you can say when guilt starts: \u201cRest helps me do what matters \u2014 this isn\u2019t failure.\u201d  \nWhich of these would you like to try now, or would you prefer a written version to take home?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 that already helps, I\u2019m relieved. I\u2019d like to try the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding now, please \u2014 I think naming things will slow my head down a bit. \n\nCould you also give me written copies of all three toolkits to take home so I can practice them later? And would you mind giving me two or three very short, natural scripts I can use with my daughter and with Marta to ask for 10\u201320 minutes of help? Something simple and time\u2011limited that doesn\u2019t sound dramatic \u2014 I\u2019d like one that feels like me asking my daughter and one that feels right for Marta next door.\n\nOne other practical thing: could you show me a concrete example of breaking a single gardening job into 15\u2011minute chunks (for example, weeding one bed or planting a row), and give me a sample one\u2011line checklist I could use in the morning? That kind of concrete plan would make it easier for me to start without spiralling.\n\nFinally, could you give me a couple of alternate short self\u2011reminder phrases I can say when the guilt starts (besides \u201cRest helps me do what matters \u2014 this isn\u2019t failure\u201d)? I\u2019d like two or three different lines I can rotate so they don\u2019t sound like empty words.\n\nI know it\u2019s a lot to ask \u2014 I feel a little emotional saying it \u2014 but I\u2019m hopeful that having these written and simple will help me practice them between visits.\nDoctor: Alright, Eleanor \u2014 let\u2019s do the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding now. Take your time; there\u2019s no rush.\n\n- When you\u2019re ready, slowly name 5 things you can see in the room. (I\u2019ll pause a moment \u2014 go ahead.)\n- Now name 4 things you can touch \u2014 notice their texture. (Pause.)\n- Now 3 things you can hear \u2014 near or far. (Pause.)\n- Name 2 things you can smell \u2014 if you don\u2019t notice smells, name two you like or imagine. (Pause.)\n- Finally, name 1 thing you can taste, or take one slow, deliberate breath and notice it.\n\nWell done \u2014 that often helps slow the head down a bit. I\u2019ll prepare printed copies of the three toolkits for you to take home.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I've been feeling down most days for quite a while now. The low energy makes even small things \u2014 keeping up with the little library shift, tending the vegetable patch for the food pantry, or running the reading group \u2014 feel like a real slog, and since I stepped back from the book club I've felt adrift and more useless than I like to admit. I replay conversations all the time and tell myself I said the wrong thing or that I'm becoming a burden to my daughter; those guilty, self-critical thoughts are constant and leave me feeling worthless. Every so often I have trouble concentrating \u2014 there are days when I can't get through a chapter or I can't decide what needs doing first \u2014 and that indecisiveness makes simple tasks take ages. It's getting in the way of my routines and my ability to follow through on things, which only makes me more anxious and hard on myself. I want to be clear I haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide, but I do feel stuck, tired, and worry a lot about being a bother.\nDoctor: Thank you, Eleanor \u2014 that sounds like a heavy, constant weight, and I really appreciate you telling me. I'm glad you said you haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide. Can you tell me when you first noticed these changes, and are there any moments or small activities that still feel manageable or give you a bit of relief?\nPatient: (her voice a little breathy, a soft sniff) It... it crept up, really \u2014 I suppose I first noticed things changing about a year to a year and a half ago. At first it was little: mornings felt heavier, I\u2019d replay a conversation and feel ashamed longer than I used to. It wasn\u2019t dramatic at first, but after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that was the turning point \u2014 everything seemed to settle into a lower place and it got steadily worse. Losing that steady role left a lot of empty space and I began to worry I was just becoming useless.\n\nMost days now I feel low; it\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache more than anything explosive. The energy just isn\u2019t there much of the time \u2014 even small tasks feel like more effort than they should. I\u2019m tired a lot, and that makes getting out to do things harder. The self-critical thoughts are almost constant: I go over things I said, imagine I\u2019ve been a burden to my daughter, tell myself I shouldn\u2019t be asking for help. Those guilty feelings sap me, and then I get anxious and hard on myself for not doing more.\n\nMy concentration slips only sometimes \u2014 maybe a few days when I can\u2019t focus long enough to finish a chapter or I faff about deciding what to do first \u2014 but when that happens a simple task can take ages and I feel foolish about it. It\u2019s not every day, but when it comes it\u2019s frustrating and feeds the worry that my memory is slipping.\n\nThere are small things that still help and I cling to them. Tending the vegetable patch and my garden gives me something practical and steady \u2014 even a short time out there helps. Short library shifts, just a couple of hours, make me feel useful again. Reading a paragraph of a book or a poem, or having a quick cup of tea with my daughter or with Marta next door, brightens a moment and reminds me I haven\u2019t lost everything I enjoy. Those small bits don\u2019t fix it, but they make the day bearable sometimes.\n\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I know I sound gloomy \u2014 but I want to be clear: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, guilty, and worried, and those feelings make it harder to keep up with the things I used to do.\nDoctor: Eleanor, that sounds exhausting \u2014 a quiet, persistent ache that\u2019s been wearing on you for a long time, and it took real courage to tell me; it makes complete sense you\u2019d hold on to small steady things like the garden, short library shifts, and a cup of tea with your daughter. Thank you for saying you haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death; would it be okay if I asked a few brief questions about your sleep, appetite, and energy so I can understand things better?\nPatient: Yes, that\u2019s fine \u2014 you can ask. I mostly sleep through the night, but mornings are heavy and slow; it takes me a long time to get going and I feel sluggish for an hour or two. My appetite hasn\u2019t changed at all. My energy is low most days \u2014 I tire easily and often need a short rest or even a brief nap \u2014 and that really makes finishing tasks harder; a simple bit of gardening or a library shift can take twice as long because I have to stop and sit down. I know I ought to push through, and I get hard on myself about it, but the fatigue really interferes with getting everything done.\nDoctor: That all sounds so tiring, Eleanor \u2014 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been wearing you down. Besides stepping back from the book club, are there other things you used to enjoy that now feel less interesting? And when you garden or read, do you still get pleasure from them or do they feel more like going through the motions \u2014 has that reduced interest been present most days, and how long has it been like that?\nPatient: No \u2014 I haven\u2019t really lost interest in things overall. Gardening still steadies me and gives me a small lift, and those short library shifts or reading a paragraph or a poem still feel worthwhile. A cup of tea with my daughter or Marta can still brighten a bit of the day. But they often take more effort now; sometimes it feels like I\u2019m going through the motions rather than being fully there, and I have to talk myself into doing them. It\u2019s been gradual \u2014 about a year to a year and a half, and it deepened after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that steady role disappearing left a hole and made everything feel a bit dulled. The fatigue and the constant guilty, self-critical thoughts get in the way of enjoying things properly (her voice cracks a little) \u2014 I slow down, I rest, and then I\u2019m hard on myself for needing to do that, which just makes it harder to really take pleasure in what I still like.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve been really brave to say all that \u2014 it sounds utterly draining, and needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing. It makes sense the small pleasures still help even when they take effort; would you like to tell me more about when those self\u2011critical thoughts are strongest, or would you prefer a moment \u2014 we can go at whatever pace feels right for you.\nPatient: (breathing in, a soft catch) I\u2026 I want to talk about it. The self\u2011critical thoughts are almost constant \u2014 it feels like a running commentary in my head that never really switches off. They\u2019re worst after I\u2019ve been with people or had to take on a role, and then again in the quiet times: evenings when the house is still, or first thing in the morning when I\u2019m slow to get started. Those are the moments when I have time to replay things and the doubts pile up.\n\nI replay conversations all the time \u2014 I\u2019ll go over a chat from the book club or a visit from my daughter and think, \u201cDid I say something stupid? Did I offend them?\u201d Even the smallest remark will loop in my head until I\u2019m convinced I sounded foolish. I keep imagining I\u2019m a burden to my daughter; if she asks to help or checks in, I immediately feel guilty and tell myself I shouldn\u2019t put her out. When I rest \u2014 which I often have to do because I\u2019m tired \u2014 the guilt hits me: I think I should be doing more instead of sitting down, and that makes me hard on myself.\n\nTiredness makes it so much worse. If I\u2019m sluggish in the morning or I\u2019ve had to stop halfway through a task, the thoughts kick in: \u201cYou\u2019re slowing everyone down,\u201d or \u201cYou can\u2019t even finish this.\u201d When jobs pile up or I have a brief lapse in concentration, it feeds a spiral of anxiety and self\u2011reproach. The whole thing is exhausting \u2014 mentally and physically \u2014 and it saps the little energy I have left. Tasks take longer because I stop, berate myself, try again, and then need to rest; it\u2019s a slow, weary cycle.\n\nThose thoughts increase my anxiety and make it harder to be present in things I still enjoy. I can still garden or read a little, and I hold onto those moments, but the joy is dulled because the guilty voice is never far behind telling me I should be doing more. (her voice quavers) It\u2019s humiliating to say, but I worry I\u2019m letting people down, and that worry makes me withdraw a bit and then feel worse about myself.\n\nI know this sounds like a lot. I want to be very clear: I have not had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, ashamed sometimes, and stuck in these persistent, self\u2011critical loops that make everyday life heavier than it needs to be.\nDoctor: That sounds so exhausting, Eleanor \u2014 no wonder you feel worn down. You mentioned being slowed and that tasks take much longer: have you or others noticed your movements or speech are noticeably slower than before, or do you sometimes feel restless or fidgety instead? When did you first notice that, and is it something you experience most days?\nPatient: No \u2014 nobody\u2019s told me that my speech or movements are noticeably slower, and I don\u2019t feel restless or fidgety at all. What\u2019s changed is an internal sluggishness: I get low on energy most days, have to stop and rest or take a short nap sometimes, and simple things just take me much longer to finish. It crept in gradually about a year to a year\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half ago and seemed to deepen after I stepped back from the book club. Other people might notice I\u2019m taking more breaks or that tasks stretch out longer, but they wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m clearly slowed in the way I talk or walk \u2014 it\u2019s more that I run out of steam and have to sit down.\nDoctor: That internal sluggishness sounds really draining, Eleanor. Roughly how many hours do you usually sleep at night? Do you have trouble falling asleep, wake during the night, or find you wake earlier than you'd like? Do you generally feel rested when you wake, and how often and for how long do you nap during the day?\nPatient: I usually sleep about seven to eight hours a night and I generally fall asleep without much trouble. I don\u2019t wake up repeatedly during the night and I\u2019m not getting up unusually early, but I rarely feel truly rested when I wake \u2014 mornings feel heavy and sluggish for an hour or two and it takes me a long time to get going. Because of that sluggishness I often need a short rest during the day, usually a brief nap of twenty to forty minutes or just sitting down for a while, and that happens on most days. Sometimes I have to stop halfway through a bit of gardening or a library task to sit down, and those pauses make simple jobs take much longer than they used to. The extra time and the need to rest feed into the self\u2011critical voice \u2014 I end up berating myself for not pushing through, which only makes me more tired and slower. It\u2019s wearing; I\u2019m trying to pace myself, but the fatigue really interferes with finishing things. I want to be clear I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide.\nDoctor: That sounds utterly wearing, Eleanor \u2014 needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed, and it\u2019s completely understandable the fatigue would feed that self\u2011critical voice. I believe you about not having any thoughts of death. Would you like to talk next about ways to manage the guilty thoughts when they start, practical pacing strategies to get through tasks, or how your daughter and neighbours might support you?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 yes, I\u2019d like to focus on that. I want concrete, practical help for the guilty, replaying thoughts and for pacing my days. The rumination hits hardest after social interactions or when I\u2019ve had to take on a role, and again in quiet mornings and evenings when I\u2019m sluggish; being tired makes everything drag, and when a task takes twice as long I immediately berate myself, which just makes me more drained. I need ways to stop that loop in the moment and to plan tasks so they actually get finished without wearing me out.\n\nSpecifically, I\u2019d really appreciate simple, usable techniques such as:\n- Short, calm phrases or language I can use when asking my daughter or Marta for a bit of help that don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m dumping on them or being a burden \u2014 wording that feels natural and not shameful.  \n- Practical pacing steps I can use for chores or gardening: how to break things into bite\u2011sized steps, set realistic priorities, schedule rests, and use timers or checklists so I don\u2019t get overwhelmed and then beat myself up.  \n- A couple of very quick ways to interrupt a negative loop in the moment \u2014 things I can do right away when the replaying starts (simple grounding, a short breathing routine, a brief physical shift), so I don\u2019t spend an hour replaying the same sentence.\n\nI also need reassurance I can lean on: gentle reminders or phrases I can say to myself that rest is not failure, and brief scripts I could use if I feel guilty about slowing down. I\u2019m hopeful that simple, practical tools like these might help me manage the fatigue and the constant self\u2011criticism so I can keep the small things I still enjoy.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear, helpful request, Eleanor \u2014 I can offer three very short, usable toolkits right now.\n\n1) Two brief scripts to ask for help (short, specific, time\u2011limited)\n- \u201cCould you help me for 20 minutes with [task]? That would really help me keep on track.\u201d  \n- \u201cWould you mind sitting with me while I do [task] for half an hour? Having company makes it easier.\u201d  \nBoth name the task and the time so it feels practical, not shameful.\n\n2) Compact pacing plan for chores/gardening (simple steps)\n- Pick 2\u20133 priorities for the day (e.g., meals/meds, one garden job, a short social/chat).  \n- Break each into 15\u201330 minute chunks, set a timer, then schedule a 10\u201315 minute rest after each chunk.  \n- Use a one\u2011line checklist with 3 items and tick them off as you go \u2014 finishing part of an item counts as progress.  \nTip: do the hardest small task when you usually feel least sluggish (often late morning), and give yourself permission to stop early and mark it done for the day.\n\n3) Two very quick ways to interrupt rumination (use immediately)\n- 30\u2011second grounding (5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111): name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste or one slow breath.  \n- 4\u20114\u20114 box breathing or quick physical shift: inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s for 3 cycles \u2014 or stand, stretch, walk to a window and take three slow breaths to change the loop.\n\nA short self\u2011reminder you can say when guilt starts: \u201cRest helps me do what matters \u2014 this isn\u2019t failure.\u201d  \nWhich of these would you like to try now, or would you prefer a written version to take home?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 that already helps, I\u2019m relieved. I\u2019d like to try the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding now, please \u2014 I think naming things will slow my head down a bit. \n\nCould you also give me written copies of all three toolkits to take home so I can practice them later? And would you mind giving me two or three very short, natural scripts I can use with my daughter and with Marta to ask for 10\u201320 minutes of help? Something simple and time\u2011limited that doesn\u2019t sound dramatic \u2014 I\u2019d like one that feels like me asking my daughter and one that feels right for Marta next door.\n\nOne other practical thing: could you show me a concrete example of breaking a single gardening job into 15\u2011minute chunks (for example, weeding one bed or planting a row), and give me a sample one\u2011line checklist I could use in the morning? That kind of concrete plan would make it easier for me to start without spiralling.\n\nFinally, could you give me a couple of alternate short self\u2011reminder phrases I can say when the guilt starts (besides \u201cRest helps me do what matters \u2014 this isn\u2019t failure\u201d)? I\u2019d like two or three different lines I can rotate so they don\u2019t sound like empty words.\n\nI know it\u2019s a lot to ask \u2014 I feel a little emotional saying it \u2014 but I\u2019m hopeful that having these written and simple will help me practice them between visits.\nDoctor: Alright, Eleanor \u2014 let\u2019s do the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding now. Take your time; there\u2019s no rush.\n\n- When you\u2019re ready, slowly name 5 things you can see in the room. (I\u2019ll pause a moment \u2014 go ahead.)\n- Now name 4 things you can touch \u2014 notice their texture. (Pause.)\n- Now 3 things you can hear \u2014 near or far. (Pause.)\n- Name 2 things you can smell \u2014 if you don\u2019t notice smells, name two you like or imagine. (Pause.)\n- Finally, name 1 thing you can taste, or take one slow, deliberate breath and notice it.\n\nWell done \u2014 that often helps slow the head down a bit. I\u2019ll prepare printed copies of the three toolkits for you to take home. Quick questions so I can tailor the scripts and examples: for your daughter, would you prefer a more intimate/warm phrasing or something straightforward? For Marta, do you want a friendly/casual tone? And which gardening task shall I break into 15\u2011minute chunks for you \u2014 weeding one bed or planting a row?\nPatient: (quietly, voice trembling a little) That grounding really did help \u2014 I feel a bit relieved, thank you. Yes, please \u2014 I\u2019d like the wording for my daughter to be intimate and warm, and for Marta to be friendly and casual. Break down \u201cweeding one bed\u201d into 15\u2011minute chunks for me, please. And I\u2019d like printed copies of the three toolkits and two very short, 10\u201320 minute scripts that feel like me to take home. Thank you \u2014 I\u2019m grateful.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve described feeling low a lot \u2014 would you say you feel depressed most of the day nearly every day, or does it come and go with some days much better?

The low energy makes even small things \u2014 keeping up with the little library shift, tending the vegetable patch for the food pantry, or running the reading group \u2014 feel like a real slog, and since I stepped back from the book club I've felt adrift and more useless than I like to admit. I replay conversations all the time and tell myself I said the wrong thing or that I'm becoming a burden to my daughter; those guilty, self-critical thoughts are constant and leave me feeling worthless. Every so often I have trouble concentrating \u2014 there are days when I can't get through a chapter or I can't decide what needs doing first \u2014 and that indecisiveness makes simple tasks take ages. It's getting in the way of my routines and my ability to follow through on things, which only makes me more anxious and hard on myself. I want to be clear I haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide, but I do feel stuck, tired, and worry a lot about being a bother.\nDoctor: Thank you, Eleanor \u2014 that sounds like a heavy, constant weight, and I really appreciate you telling me. I'm glad you said you haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide. Can you tell me when you first noticed these changes, and are there any moments or small activities that still feel manageable or give you a bit of relief?\nPatient: (her voice a little breathy, a soft sniff) It... it crept up, really \u2014 I suppose I first noticed things changing about a year to a year and a half ago. At first it was little: mornings felt heavier, I\u2019d replay a conversation and feel ashamed longer than I used to. It wasn\u2019t dramatic at first, but after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that was the turning point \u2014 everything seemed to settle into a lower place and it got steadily worse. Losing that steady role left a lot of empty space and I began to worry I was just becoming useless.\n\nMost days now I feel low; it\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache more than anything explosive. The energy just isn\u2019t there much of the time \u2014 even small tasks feel like more effort than they should. I\u2019m tired a lot, and that makes getting out to do things harder. The self-critical thoughts are almost constant: I go over things I said, imagine I\u2019ve been a burden to my daughter, tell myself I shouldn\u2019t be asking for help. Those guilty feelings sap me, and then I get anxious and hard on myself for not doing more.\n\nMy concentration slips only sometimes \u2014 maybe a few days when I can\u2019t focus long enough to finish a chapter or I faff about deciding what to do first \u2014 but when that happens a simple task can take ages and I feel foolish about it. It\u2019s not every day, but when it comes it\u2019s frustrating and feeds the worry that my memory is slipping.\n\nThere are small things that still help and I cling to them. Tending the vegetable patch and my garden gives me something practical and steady \u2014 even a short time out there helps. Short library shifts, just a couple of hours, make me feel useful again. Reading a paragraph of a book or a poem, or having a quick cup of tea with my daughter or with Marta next door, brightens a moment and reminds me I haven\u2019t lost everything I enjoy. Those small bits don\u2019t fix it, but they make the day bearable sometimes.\n\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I know I sound gloomy \u2014 but I want to be clear: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, guilty, and worried, and those feelings make it harder to keep up with the things I used to do.\nDoctor: Eleanor, that sounds exhausting \u2014 a quiet, persistent ache that\u2019s been wearing on you for a long time, and it took real courage to tell me; it makes complete sense you\u2019d hold on to small steady things like the garden, short library shifts, and a cup of tea with your daughter. Thank you for saying you haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death; would it be okay if I asked a few brief questions about your sleep, appetite, and energy so I can understand things better?\nPatient: Yes, that\u2019s fine \u2014 you can ask. I mostly sleep through the night, but mornings are heavy and slow; it takes me a long time to get going and I feel sluggish for an hour or two. My appetite hasn\u2019t changed at all. My energy is low most days \u2014 I tire easily and often need a short rest or even a brief nap \u2014 and that really makes finishing tasks harder; a simple bit of gardening or a library shift can take twice as long because I have to stop and sit down. I know I ought to push through, and I get hard on myself about it, but the fatigue really interferes with getting everything done.\nDoctor: That all sounds so tiring, Eleanor \u2014 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been wearing you down. Besides stepping back from the book club, are there other things you used to enjoy that now feel less interesting? And when you garden or read, do you still get pleasure from them or do they feel more like going through the motions \u2014 has that reduced interest been present most days, and how long has it been like that?\nPatient: No \u2014 I haven\u2019t really lost interest in things overall. Gardening still steadies me and gives me a small lift, and those short library shifts or reading a paragraph or a poem still feel worthwhile. A cup of tea with my daughter or Marta can still brighten a bit of the day. But they often take more effort now; sometimes it feels like I\u2019m going through the motions rather than being fully there, and I have to talk myself into doing them. It\u2019s been gradual \u2014 about a year to a year and a half, and it deepened after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that steady role disappearing left a hole and made everything feel a bit dulled. The fatigue and the constant guilty, self-critical thoughts get in the way of enjoying things properly (her voice cracks a little) \u2014 I slow down, I rest, and then I\u2019m hard on myself for needing to do that, which just makes it harder to really take pleasure in what I still like.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve been really brave to say all that \u2014 it sounds utterly draining, and needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing. It makes sense the small pleasures still help even when they take effort; would you like to tell me more about when those self\u2011critical thoughts are strongest, or would you prefer a moment \u2014 we can go at whatever pace feels right for you.\nPatient: (breathing in, a soft catch) I\u2026 I want to talk about it. The self\u2011critical thoughts are almost constant \u2014 it feels like a running commentary in my head that never really switches off. They\u2019re worst after I\u2019ve been with people or had to take on a role, and then again in the quiet times: evenings when the house is still, or first thing in the morning when I\u2019m slow to get started. Those are the moments when I have time to replay things and the doubts pile up.\n\nI replay conversations all the time \u2014 I\u2019ll go over a chat from the book club or a visit from my daughter and think, \u201cDid I say something stupid? Did I offend them?\u201d Even the smallest remark will loop in my head until I\u2019m convinced I sounded foolish. I keep imagining I\u2019m a burden to my daughter; if she asks to help or checks in, I immediately feel guilty and tell myself I shouldn\u2019t put her out. When I rest \u2014 which I often have to do because I\u2019m tired \u2014 the guilt hits me: I think I should be doing more instead of sitting down, and that makes me hard on myself.\n\nTiredness makes it so much worse. If I\u2019m sluggish in the morning or I\u2019ve had to stop halfway through a task, the thoughts kick in: \u201cYou\u2019re slowing everyone down,\u201d or \u201cYou can\u2019t even finish this.\u201d When jobs pile up or I have a brief lapse in concentration, it feeds a spiral of anxiety and self\u2011reproach. The whole thing is exhausting \u2014 mentally and physically \u2014 and it saps the little energy I have left. Tasks take longer because I stop, berate myself, try again, and then need to rest; it\u2019s a slow, weary cycle.\n\nThose thoughts increase my anxiety and make it harder to be present in things I still enjoy. I can still garden or read a little, and I hold onto those moments, but the joy is dulled because the guilty voice is never far behind telling me I should be doing more. (her voice quavers) It\u2019s humiliating to say, but I worry I\u2019m letting people down, and that worry makes me withdraw a bit and then feel worse about myself.\n\nI know this sounds like a lot. I want to be very clear: I have not had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, ashamed sometimes, and stuck in these persistent, self\u2011critical loops that make everyday life heavier than it needs to be.\nDoctor: That sounds so exhausting, Eleanor \u2014 no wonder you feel worn down. You mentioned being slowed and that tasks take much longer: have you or others noticed your movements or speech are noticeably slower than before, or do you sometimes feel restless or fidgety instead? When did you first notice that, and is it something you experience most days?\nPatient: No \u2014 nobody\u2019s told me that my speech or movements are noticeably slower, and I don\u2019t feel restless or fidgety at all. What\u2019s changed is an internal sluggishness: I get low on energy most days, have to stop and rest or take a short nap sometimes, and simple things just take me much longer to finish. It crept in gradually about a year to a year\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half ago and seemed to deepen after I stepped back from the book club. Other people might notice I\u2019m taking more breaks or that tasks stretch out longer, but they wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m clearly slowed in the way I talk or walk \u2014 it\u2019s more that I run out of steam and have to sit down.\nDoctor: That internal sluggishness sounds really draining, Eleanor. Roughly how many hours do you usually sleep at night? Do you have trouble falling asleep, wake during the night, or find you wake earlier than you'd like? Do you generally feel rested when you wake, and how often and for how long do you nap during the day?\nPatient: I usually sleep about seven to eight hours a night and I generally fall asleep without much trouble. I don\u2019t wake up repeatedly during the night and I\u2019m not getting up unusually early, but I rarely feel truly rested when I wake \u2014 mornings feel heavy and sluggish for an hour or two and it takes me a long time to get going. Because of that sluggishness I often need a short rest during the day, usually a brief nap of twenty to forty minutes or just sitting down for a while, and that happens on most days. Sometimes I have to stop halfway through a bit of gardening or a library task to sit down, and those pauses make simple jobs take much longer than they used to. The extra time and the need to rest feed into the self\u2011critical voice \u2014 I end up berating myself for not pushing through, which only makes me more tired and slower. It\u2019s wearing; I\u2019m trying to pace myself, but the fatigue really interferes with finishing things. I want to be clear I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide.\nDoctor: That sounds utterly wearing, Eleanor \u2014 needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed, and it\u2019s completely understandable the fatigue would feed that self\u2011critical voice. I believe you about not having any thoughts of death. Would you like to talk next about ways to manage the guilty thoughts when they start, practical pacing strategies to get through tasks, or how your daughter and neighbours might support you?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 yes, I\u2019d like to focus on that. I want concrete, practical help for the guilty, replaying thoughts and for pacing my days. The rumination hits hardest after social interactions or when I\u2019ve had to take on a role, and again in quiet mornings and evenings when I\u2019m sluggish; being tired makes everything drag, and when a task takes twice as long I immediately berate myself, which just makes me more drained. I need ways to stop that loop in the moment and to plan tasks so they actually get finished without wearing me out.\n\nSpecifically, I\u2019d really appreciate simple, usable techniques such as:\n- Short, calm phrases or language I can use when asking my daughter or Marta for a bit of help that don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m dumping on them or being a burden \u2014 wording that feels natural and not shameful.  \n- Practical pacing steps I can use for chores or gardening: how to break things into bite\u2011sized steps, set realistic priorities, schedule rests, and use timers or checklists so I don\u2019t get overwhelmed and then beat myself up.  \n- A couple of very quick ways to interrupt a negative loop in the moment \u2014 things I can do right away when the replaying starts (simple grounding, a short breathing routine, a brief physical shift), so I don\u2019t spend an hour replaying the same sentence.\n\nI also need reassurance I can lean on: gentle reminders or phrases I can say to myself that rest is not failure, and brief scripts I could use if I feel guilty about slowing down. I\u2019m hopeful that simple, practical tools like these might help me manage the fatigue and the constant self\u2011criticism so I can keep the small things I still enjoy.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear, helpful request, Eleanor \u2014 I can offer three very short, usable toolkits right now.\n\n1) Two brief scripts to ask for help (short, specific, time\u2011limited)\n- \u201cCould you help me for 20 minutes with [task]? That would really help me keep on track.\u201d  \n- \u201cWould you mind sitting with me while I do [task] for half an hour? Having company makes it easier.\u201d  \nBoth name the task and the time so it feels practical, not shameful.\n\n2) Compact pacing plan for chores/gardening (simple steps)\n- Pick 2\u20133 priorities for the day (e.g., meals/meds, one garden job, a short social/chat).  \n- Break each into 15\u201330 minute chunks, set a timer, then schedule a 10\u201315 minute rest after each chunk.  \n- Use a one\u2011line checklist with 3 items and tick them off as you go \u2014 finishing part of an item counts as progress.  \nTip: do the hardest small task when you usually feel least sluggish (often late morning), and give yourself permission to stop early and mark it done for the day.\n\n3) Two very quick ways to interrupt rumination (use immediately)\n- 30\u2011second grounding (5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111): name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste or one slow breath.  \n- 4\u20114\u20114 box breathing or quick physical shift: inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s for 3 cycles \u2014 or stand, stretch, walk to a window and take three slow breaths to change the loop.\n\nA short self\u2011reminder you can say when guilt starts: \u201cRest helps me do what matters \u2014 this isn\u2019t failure.\u201d  \nWhich of these would you like to try now, or would you prefer a written version to take home?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 that already helps, I\u2019m relieved. I\u2019d like to try the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding now, please \u2014 I think naming things will slow my head down a bit. \n\nCould you also give me written copies of all three toolkits to take home so I can practice them later? And would you mind giving me two or three very short, natural scripts I can use with my daughter and with Marta to ask for 10\u201320 minutes of help? Something simple and time\u2011limited that doesn\u2019t sound dramatic \u2014 I\u2019d like one that feels like me asking my daughter and one that feels right for Marta next door.\n\nOne other practical thing: could you show me a concrete example of breaking a single gardening job into 15\u2011minute chunks (for example, weeding one bed or planting a row), and give me a sample one\u2011line checklist I could use in the morning? That kind of concrete plan would make it easier for me to start without spiralling.\n\nFinally, could you give me a couple of alternate short self\u2011reminder phrases I can say when the guilt starts (besides \u201cRest helps me do what matters \u2014 this isn\u2019t failure\u201d)? I\u2019d like two or three different lines I can rotate so they don\u2019t sound like empty words.\n\nI know it\u2019s a lot to ask \u2014 I feel a little emotional saying it \u2014 but I\u2019m hopeful that having these written and simple will help me practice them between visits.\nDoctor: Alright, Eleanor \u2014 let\u2019s do the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding now. Take your time; there\u2019s no rush.\n\n- When you\u2019re ready, slowly name 5 things you can see in the room. (I\u2019ll pause a moment \u2014 go ahead.)\n- Now name 4 things you can touch \u2014 notice their texture. (Pause.)\n- Now 3 things you can hear \u2014 near or far. (Pause.)\n- Name 2 things you can smell \u2014 if you don\u2019t notice smells, name two you like or imagine. (Pause.)\n- Finally, name 1 thing you can taste, or take one slow, deliberate breath and notice it.\n\nWell done \u2014 that often helps slow the head down a bit. I\u2019ll prepare printed copies of the three toolkits for you to take home. Quick questions so I can tailor the scripts and examples: for your daughter, would you prefer a more intimate/warm phrasing or something straightforward? For Marta, do you want a friendly/casual tone? And which gardening task shall I break into 15\u2011minute chunks for you \u2014 weeding one bed or planting a row?\nPatient: (quietly, voice trembling a little) That grounding really did help \u2014 I feel a bit relieved, thank you. Yes, please \u2014 I\u2019d like the wording for my daughter to be intimate and warm, and for Marta to be friendly and casual. Break down \u201cweeding one bed\u201d into 15\u2011minute chunks for me, please. And I\u2019d like printed copies of the three toolkits and two very short, 10\u201320 minute scripts that feel like me to take home. Thank you \u2014 I\u2019m grateful.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve described feeling low a lot \u2014 would you say you feel depressed most of the day nearly every day, or does it come and go with some days much better? On a typical day, about how much of the day would you say you feel that low \u2014 most of it, a few hours, or just briefly now and then?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 it\u2019s most of the day, nearly every day. It\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache that hangs around through much of my waking hours; I\u2019d say about two\u2011thirds to three\u2011quarters of the day feels low \u2014 often after a sluggish morning it settles in and stays with me through the afternoon and into the evening, with only short pockets of relief. Those little things \u2014 a bit of gardening, a short library shift, a cup of tea \u2014 can lift me for a while, but they don\u2019t change the overall low for long. It\u2019s been like this for about a year to a year and a half, and most days I\u2019m also tired and carrying that running, self\u2011critical voice which makes getting things done harder.\nDoctor: Thank you \u2014 that helps me understand. Have you noticed any change in your appetite or weight lately \u2014 eating more or less than usual, or any unintentional weight loss or gain over the past few months?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThank you \u2014 that helps me understand.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I've been feeling down most days for quite a while now. The low energy makes even small things \u2014 keeping up with the little library shift, tending the vegetable patch for the food pantry, or running the reading group \u2014 feel like a real slog, and since I stepped back from the book club I've felt adrift and more useless than I like to admit. I replay conversations all the time and tell myself I said the wrong thing or that I'm becoming a burden to my daughter; those guilty, self-critical thoughts are constant and leave me feeling worthless. Every so often I have trouble concentrating \u2014 there are days when I can't get through a chapter or I can't decide what needs doing first \u2014 and that indecisiveness makes simple tasks take ages. It's getting in the way of my routines and my ability to follow through on things, which only makes me more anxious and hard on myself. I want to be clear I haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide, but I do feel stuck, tired, and worry a lot about being a bother.\nDoctor: Thank you, Eleanor \u2014 that sounds like a heavy, constant weight, and I really appreciate you telling me. I'm glad you said you haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide. Can you tell me when you first noticed these changes, and are there any moments or small activities that still feel manageable or give you a bit of relief?\nPatient: (her voice a little breathy, a soft sniff) It... it crept up, really \u2014 I suppose I first noticed things changing about a year to a year and a half ago. At first it was little: mornings felt heavier, I\u2019d replay a conversation and feel ashamed longer than I used to. It wasn\u2019t dramatic at first, but after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that was the turning point \u2014 everything seemed to settle into a lower place and it got steadily worse. Losing that steady role left a lot of empty space and I began to worry I was just becoming useless.\n\nMost days now I feel low; it\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache more than anything explosive. The energy just isn\u2019t there much of the time \u2014 even small tasks feel like more effort than they should. I\u2019m tired a lot, and that makes getting out to do things harder. The self-critical thoughts are almost constant: I go over things I said, imagine I\u2019ve been a burden to my daughter, tell myself I shouldn\u2019t be asking for help. Those guilty feelings sap me, and then I get anxious and hard on myself for not doing more.\n\nMy concentration slips only sometimes \u2014 maybe a few days when I can\u2019t focus long enough to finish a chapter or I faff about deciding what to do first \u2014 but when that happens a simple task can take ages and I feel foolish about it. It\u2019s not every day, but when it comes it\u2019s frustrating and feeds the worry that my memory is slipping.\n\nThere are small things that still help and I cling to them. Tending the vegetable patch and my garden gives me something practical and steady \u2014 even a short time out there helps. Short library shifts, just a couple of hours, make me feel useful again. Reading a paragraph of a book or a poem, or having a quick cup of tea with my daughter or with Marta next door, brightens a moment and reminds me I haven\u2019t lost everything I enjoy. Those small bits don\u2019t fix it, but they make the day bearable sometimes.\n\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I know I sound gloomy \u2014 but I want to be clear: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, guilty, and worried, and those feelings make it harder to keep up with the things I used to do.\nDoctor: Eleanor, that sounds exhausting \u2014 a quiet, persistent ache that\u2019s been wearing on you for a long time, and it took real courage to tell me; it makes complete sense you\u2019d hold on to small steady things like the garden, short library shifts, and a cup of tea with your daughter. Thank you for saying you haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death; would it be okay if I asked a few brief questions about your sleep, appetite, and energy so I can understand things better?\nPatient: Yes, that\u2019s fine \u2014 you can ask. I mostly sleep through the night, but mornings are heavy and slow; it takes me a long time to get going and I feel sluggish for an hour or two. My appetite hasn\u2019t changed at all. My energy is low most days \u2014 I tire easily and often need a short rest or even a brief nap \u2014 and that really makes finishing tasks harder; a simple bit of gardening or a library shift can take twice as long because I have to stop and sit down. I know I ought to push through, and I get hard on myself about it, but the fatigue really interferes with getting everything done.\nDoctor: That all sounds so tiring, Eleanor \u2014 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been wearing you down. Besides stepping back from the book club, are there other things you used to enjoy that now feel less interesting? And when you garden or read, do you still get pleasure from them or do they feel more like going through the motions \u2014 has that reduced interest been present most days, and how long has it been like that?\nPatient: No \u2014 I haven\u2019t really lost interest in things overall. Gardening still steadies me and gives me a small lift, and those short library shifts or reading a paragraph or a poem still feel worthwhile. A cup of tea with my daughter or Marta can still brighten a bit of the day. But they often take more effort now; sometimes it feels like I\u2019m going through the motions rather than being fully there, and I have to talk myself into doing them. It\u2019s been gradual \u2014 about a year to a year and a half, and it deepened after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that steady role disappearing left a hole and made everything feel a bit dulled. The fatigue and the constant guilty, self-critical thoughts get in the way of enjoying things properly (her voice cracks a little) \u2014 I slow down, I rest, and then I\u2019m hard on myself for needing to do that, which just makes it harder to really take pleasure in what I still like.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve been really brave to say all that \u2014 it sounds utterly draining, and needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing. It makes sense the small pleasures still help even when they take effort; would you like to tell me more about when those self\u2011critical thoughts are strongest, or would you prefer a moment \u2014 we can go at whatever pace feels right for you.\nPatient: (breathing in, a soft catch) I\u2026 I want to talk about it. The self\u2011critical thoughts are almost constant \u2014 it feels like a running commentary in my head that never really switches off. They\u2019re worst after I\u2019ve been with people or had to take on a role, and then again in the quiet times: evenings when the house is still, or first thing in the morning when I\u2019m slow to get started. Those are the moments when I have time to replay things and the doubts pile up.\n\nI replay conversations all the time \u2014 I\u2019ll go over a chat from the book club or a visit from my daughter and think, \u201cDid I say something stupid? Did I offend them?\u201d Even the smallest remark will loop in my head until I\u2019m convinced I sounded foolish. I keep imagining I\u2019m a burden to my daughter; if she asks to help or checks in, I immediately feel guilty and tell myself I shouldn\u2019t put her out. When I rest \u2014 which I often have to do because I\u2019m tired \u2014 the guilt hits me: I think I should be doing more instead of sitting down, and that makes me hard on myself.\n\nTiredness makes it so much worse. If I\u2019m sluggish in the morning or I\u2019ve had to stop halfway through a task, the thoughts kick in: \u201cYou\u2019re slowing everyone down,\u201d or \u201cYou can\u2019t even finish this.\u201d When jobs pile up or I have a brief lapse in concentration, it feeds a spiral of anxiety and self\u2011reproach. The whole thing is exhausting \u2014 mentally and physically \u2014 and it saps the little energy I have left. Tasks take longer because I stop, berate myself, try again, and then need to rest; it\u2019s a slow, weary cycle.\n\nThose thoughts increase my anxiety and make it harder to be present in things I still enjoy. I can still garden or read a little, and I hold onto those moments, but the joy is dulled because the guilty voice is never far behind telling me I should be doing more. (her voice quavers) It\u2019s humiliating to say, but I worry I\u2019m letting people down, and that worry makes me withdraw a bit and then feel worse about myself.\n\nI know this sounds like a lot. I want to be very clear: I have not had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, ashamed sometimes, and stuck in these persistent, self\u2011critical loops that make everyday life heavier than it needs to be.\nDoctor: That sounds so exhausting, Eleanor \u2014 no wonder you feel worn down. You mentioned being slowed and that tasks take much longer: have you or others noticed your movements or speech are noticeably slower than before, or do you sometimes feel restless or fidgety instead? When did you first notice that, and is it something you experience most days?\nPatient: No \u2014 nobody\u2019s told me that my speech or movements are noticeably slower, and I don\u2019t feel restless or fidgety at all. What\u2019s changed is an internal sluggishness: I get low on energy most days, have to stop and rest or take a short nap sometimes, and simple things just take me much longer to finish. It crept in gradually about a year to a year\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half ago and seemed to deepen after I stepped back from the book club. Other people might notice I\u2019m taking more breaks or that tasks stretch out longer, but they wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m clearly slowed in the way I talk or walk \u2014 it\u2019s more that I run out of steam and have to sit down.\nDoctor: That internal sluggishness sounds really draining, Eleanor. Roughly how many hours do you usually sleep at night? Do you have trouble falling asleep, wake during the night, or find you wake earlier than you'd like? Do you generally feel rested when you wake, and how often and for how long do you nap during the day?\nPatient: I usually sleep about seven to eight hours a night and I generally fall asleep without much trouble. I don\u2019t wake up repeatedly during the night and I\u2019m not getting up unusually early, but I rarely feel truly rested when I wake \u2014 mornings feel heavy and sluggish for an hour or two and it takes me a long time to get going. Because of that sluggishness I often need a short rest during the day, usually a brief nap of twenty to forty minutes or just sitting down for a while, and that happens on most days. Sometimes I have to stop halfway through a bit of gardening or a library task to sit down, and those pauses make simple jobs take much longer than they used to. The extra time and the need to rest feed into the self\u2011critical voice \u2014 I end up berating myself for not pushing through, which only makes me more tired and slower. It\u2019s wearing; I\u2019m trying to pace myself, but the fatigue really interferes with finishing things. I want to be clear I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide.\nDoctor: That sounds utterly wearing, Eleanor \u2014 needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed, and it\u2019s completely understandable the fatigue would feed that self\u2011critical voice. I believe you about not having any thoughts of death. Would you like to talk next about ways to manage the guilty thoughts when they start, practical pacing strategies to get through tasks, or how your daughter and neighbours might support you?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 yes, I\u2019d like to focus on that. I want concrete, practical help for the guilty, replaying thoughts and for pacing my days. The rumination hits hardest after social interactions or when I\u2019ve had to take on a role, and again in quiet mornings and evenings when I\u2019m sluggish; being tired makes everything drag, and when a task takes twice as long I immediately berate myself, which just makes me more drained. I need ways to stop that loop in the moment and to plan tasks so they actually get finished without wearing me out.\n\nSpecifically, I\u2019d really appreciate simple, usable techniques such as:\n- Short, calm phrases or language I can use when asking my daughter or Marta for a bit of help that don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m dumping on them or being a burden \u2014 wording that feels natural and not shameful.  \n- Practical pacing steps I can use for chores or gardening: how to break things into bite\u2011sized steps, set realistic priorities, schedule rests, and use timers or checklists so I don\u2019t get overwhelmed and then beat myself up.  \n- A couple of very quick ways to interrupt a negative loop in the moment \u2014 things I can do right away when the replaying starts (simple grounding, a short breathing routine, a brief physical shift), so I don\u2019t spend an hour replaying the same sentence.\n\nI also need reassurance I can lean on: gentle reminders or phrases I can say to myself that rest is not failure, and brief scripts I could use if I feel guilty about slowing down. I\u2019m hopeful that simple, practical tools like these might help me manage the fatigue and the constant self\u2011criticism so I can keep the small things I still enjoy.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear, helpful request, Eleanor \u2014 I can offer three very short, usable toolkits right now.\n\n1) Two brief scripts to ask for help (short, specific, time\u2011limited)\n- \u201cCould you help me for 20 minutes with [task]? That would really help me keep on track.\u201d  \n- \u201cWould you mind sitting with me while I do [task] for half an hour? Having company makes it easier.\u201d  \nBoth name the task and the time so it feels practical, not shameful.\n\n2) Compact pacing plan for chores/gardening (simple steps)\n- Pick 2\u20133 priorities for the day (e.g., meals/meds, one garden job, a short social/chat).  \n- Break each into 15\u201330 minute chunks, set a timer, then schedule a 10\u201315 minute rest after each chunk.  \n- Use a one\u2011line checklist with 3 items and tick them off as you go \u2014 finishing part of an item counts as progress.  \nTip: do the hardest small task when you usually feel least sluggish (often late morning), and give yourself permission to stop early and mark it done for the day.\n\n3) Two very quick ways to interrupt rumination (use immediately)\n- 30\u2011second grounding (5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111): name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste or one slow breath.  \n- 4\u20114\u20114 box breathing or quick physical shift: inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s for 3 cycles \u2014 or stand, stretch, walk to a window and take three slow breaths to change the loop.\n\nA short self\u2011reminder you can say when guilt starts: \u201cRest helps me do what matters \u2014 this isn\u2019t failure.\u201d  \nWhich of these would you like to try now, or would you prefer a written version to take home?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 that already helps, I\u2019m relieved. I\u2019d like to try the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding now, please \u2014 I think naming things will slow my head down a bit. \n\nCould you also give me written copies of all three toolkits to take home so I can practice them later? And would you mind giving me two or three very short, natural scripts I can use with my daughter and with Marta to ask for 10\u201320 minutes of help? Something simple and time\u2011limited that doesn\u2019t sound dramatic \u2014 I\u2019d like one that feels like me asking my daughter and one that feels right for Marta next door.\n\nOne other practical thing: could you show me a concrete example of breaking a single gardening job into 15\u2011minute chunks (for example, weeding one bed or planting a row), and give me a sample one\u2011line checklist I could use in the morning? That kind of concrete plan would make it easier for me to start without spiralling.\n\nFinally, could you give me a couple of alternate short self\u2011reminder phrases I can say when the guilt starts (besides \u201cRest helps me do what matters \u2014 this isn\u2019t failure\u201d)? I\u2019d like two or three different lines I can rotate so they don\u2019t sound like empty words.\n\nI know it\u2019s a lot to ask \u2014 I feel a little emotional saying it \u2014 but I\u2019m hopeful that having these written and simple will help me practice them between visits.\nDoctor: Alright, Eleanor \u2014 let\u2019s do the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding now. Take your time; there\u2019s no rush.\n\n- When you\u2019re ready, slowly name 5 things you can see in the room. (I\u2019ll pause a moment \u2014 go ahead.)\n- Now name 4 things you can touch \u2014 notice their texture. (Pause.)\n- Now 3 things you can hear \u2014 near or far. (Pause.)\n- Name 2 things you can smell \u2014 if you don\u2019t notice smells, name two you like or imagine. (Pause.)\n- Finally, name 1 thing you can taste, or take one slow, deliberate breath and notice it.\n\nWell done \u2014 that often helps slow the head down a bit. I\u2019ll prepare printed copies of the three toolkits for you to take home. Quick questions so I can tailor the scripts and examples: for your daughter, would you prefer a more intimate/warm phrasing or something straightforward? For Marta, do you want a friendly/casual tone? And which gardening task shall I break into 15\u2011minute chunks for you \u2014 weeding one bed or planting a row?\nPatient: (quietly, voice trembling a little) That grounding really did help \u2014 I feel a bit relieved, thank you. Yes, please \u2014 I\u2019d like the wording for my daughter to be intimate and warm, and for Marta to be friendly and casual. Break down \u201cweeding one bed\u201d into 15\u2011minute chunks for me, please. And I\u2019d like printed copies of the three toolkits and two very short, 10\u201320 minute scripts that feel like me to take home. Thank you \u2014 I\u2019m grateful.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve described feeling low a lot \u2014 would you say you feel depressed most of the day nearly every day, or does it come and go with some days much better? On a typical day, about how much of the day would you say you feel that low \u2014 most of it, a few hours, or just briefly now and then?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 it\u2019s most of the day, nearly every day. It\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache that hangs around through much of my waking hours; I\u2019d say about two\u2011thirds to three\u2011quarters of the day feels low \u2014 often after a sluggish morning it settles in and stays with me through the afternoon and into the evening, with only short pockets of relief. Those little things \u2014 a bit of gardening, a short library shift, a cup of tea \u2014 can lift me for a while, but they don\u2019t change the overall low for long. It\u2019s been like this for about a year to a year and a half, and most days I\u2019m also tired and carrying that running, self\u2011critical voice which makes getting things done harder.\nDoctor: Thank you \u2014 that helps me understand. Have you noticed any change in your appetite or weight lately \u2014 eating more or less than usual, or any unintentional weight loss or gain over the past few months?\nPatient: No, my appetite hasn\u2019t changed \u2014 I eat about the same as I always have, breakfast, a light lunch, and dinner, and I haven\u2019t noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain. My weight\u2019s been stable. It\u2019s the fatigue that\u2019s the problem, not eating; I get tired and need to rest, which is what makes things harder to finish. And just to repeat, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve described low energy and naps most days \u2014 how much does that fatigue stop you from doing things you want or need to do?

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I've been feeling down most days for quite a while now. The low energy makes even small things \u2014 keeping up with the little library shift, tending the vegetable patch for the food pantry, or running the reading group \u2014 feel like a real slog, and since I stepped back from the book club I've felt adrift and more useless than I like to admit. I replay conversations all the time and tell myself I said the wrong thing or that I'm becoming a burden to my daughter; those guilty, self-critical thoughts are constant and leave me feeling worthless. Every so often I have trouble concentrating \u2014 there are days when I can't get through a chapter or I can't decide what needs doing first \u2014 and that indecisiveness makes simple tasks take ages. It's getting in the way of my routines and my ability to follow through on things, which only makes me more anxious and hard on myself. I want to be clear I haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide, but I do feel stuck, tired, and worry a lot about being a bother.\nDoctor: Thank you, Eleanor \u2014 that sounds like a heavy, constant weight, and I really appreciate you telling me. I'm glad you said you haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide. Can you tell me when you first noticed these changes, and are there any moments or small activities that still feel manageable or give you a bit of relief?\nPatient: (her voice a little breathy, a soft sniff) It... it crept up, really \u2014 I suppose I first noticed things changing about a year to a year and a half ago. At first it was little: mornings felt heavier, I\u2019d replay a conversation and feel ashamed longer than I used to. It wasn\u2019t dramatic at first, but after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that was the turning point \u2014 everything seemed to settle into a lower place and it got steadily worse. Losing that steady role left a lot of empty space and I began to worry I was just becoming useless.\n\nMost days now I feel low; it\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache more than anything explosive. The energy just isn\u2019t there much of the time \u2014 even small tasks feel like more effort than they should. I\u2019m tired a lot, and that makes getting out to do things harder. The self-critical thoughts are almost constant: I go over things I said, imagine I\u2019ve been a burden to my daughter, tell myself I shouldn\u2019t be asking for help. Those guilty feelings sap me, and then I get anxious and hard on myself for not doing more.\n\nMy concentration slips only sometimes \u2014 maybe a few days when I can\u2019t focus long enough to finish a chapter or I faff about deciding what to do first \u2014 but when that happens a simple task can take ages and I feel foolish about it. It\u2019s not every day, but when it comes it\u2019s frustrating and feeds the worry that my memory is slipping.\n\nThere are small things that still help and I cling to them. Tending the vegetable patch and my garden gives me something practical and steady \u2014 even a short time out there helps. Short library shifts, just a couple of hours, make me feel useful again. Reading a paragraph of a book or a poem, or having a quick cup of tea with my daughter or with Marta next door, brightens a moment and reminds me I haven\u2019t lost everything I enjoy. Those small bits don\u2019t fix it, but they make the day bearable sometimes.\n\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I know I sound gloomy \u2014 but I want to be clear: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, guilty, and worried, and those feelings make it harder to keep up with the things I used to do.\nDoctor: Eleanor, that sounds exhausting \u2014 a quiet, persistent ache that\u2019s been wearing on you for a long time, and it took real courage to tell me; it makes complete sense you\u2019d hold on to small steady things like the garden, short library shifts, and a cup of tea with your daughter. Thank you for saying you haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death; would it be okay if I asked a few brief questions about your sleep, appetite, and energy so I can understand things better?\nPatient: Yes, that\u2019s fine \u2014 you can ask. I mostly sleep through the night, but mornings are heavy and slow; it takes me a long time to get going and I feel sluggish for an hour or two. My appetite hasn\u2019t changed at all. My energy is low most days \u2014 I tire easily and often need a short rest or even a brief nap \u2014 and that really makes finishing tasks harder; a simple bit of gardening or a library shift can take twice as long because I have to stop and sit down. I know I ought to push through, and I get hard on myself about it, but the fatigue really interferes with getting everything done.\nDoctor: That all sounds so tiring, Eleanor \u2014 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been wearing you down. Besides stepping back from the book club, are there other things you used to enjoy that now feel less interesting? And when you garden or read, do you still get pleasure from them or do they feel more like going through the motions \u2014 has that reduced interest been present most days, and how long has it been like that?\nPatient: No \u2014 I haven\u2019t really lost interest in things overall. Gardening still steadies me and gives me a small lift, and those short library shifts or reading a paragraph or a poem still feel worthwhile. A cup of tea with my daughter or Marta can still brighten a bit of the day. But they often take more effort now; sometimes it feels like I\u2019m going through the motions rather than being fully there, and I have to talk myself into doing them. It\u2019s been gradual \u2014 about a year to a year and a half, and it deepened after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that steady role disappearing left a hole and made everything feel a bit dulled. The fatigue and the constant guilty, self-critical thoughts get in the way of enjoying things properly (her voice cracks a little) \u2014 I slow down, I rest, and then I\u2019m hard on myself for needing to do that, which just makes it harder to really take pleasure in what I still like.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve been really brave to say all that \u2014 it sounds utterly draining, and needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing. It makes sense the small pleasures still help even when they take effort; would you like to tell me more about when those self\u2011critical thoughts are strongest, or would you prefer a moment \u2014 we can go at whatever pace feels right for you.\nPatient: (breathing in, a soft catch) I\u2026 I want to talk about it. The self\u2011critical thoughts are almost constant \u2014 it feels like a running commentary in my head that never really switches off. They\u2019re worst after I\u2019ve been with people or had to take on a role, and then again in the quiet times: evenings when the house is still, or first thing in the morning when I\u2019m slow to get started. Those are the moments when I have time to replay things and the doubts pile up.\n\nI replay conversations all the time \u2014 I\u2019ll go over a chat from the book club or a visit from my daughter and think, \u201cDid I say something stupid? Did I offend them?\u201d Even the smallest remark will loop in my head until I\u2019m convinced I sounded foolish. I keep imagining I\u2019m a burden to my daughter; if she asks to help or checks in, I immediately feel guilty and tell myself I shouldn\u2019t put her out. When I rest \u2014 which I often have to do because I\u2019m tired \u2014 the guilt hits me: I think I should be doing more instead of sitting down, and that makes me hard on myself.\n\nTiredness makes it so much worse. If I\u2019m sluggish in the morning or I\u2019ve had to stop halfway through a task, the thoughts kick in: \u201cYou\u2019re slowing everyone down,\u201d or \u201cYou can\u2019t even finish this.\u201d When jobs pile up or I have a brief lapse in concentration, it feeds a spiral of anxiety and self\u2011reproach. The whole thing is exhausting \u2014 mentally and physically \u2014 and it saps the little energy I have left. Tasks take longer because I stop, berate myself, try again, and then need to rest; it\u2019s a slow, weary cycle.\n\nThose thoughts increase my anxiety and make it harder to be present in things I still enjoy. I can still garden or read a little, and I hold onto those moments, but the joy is dulled because the guilty voice is never far behind telling me I should be doing more. (her voice quavers) It\u2019s humiliating to say, but I worry I\u2019m letting people down, and that worry makes me withdraw a bit and then feel worse about myself.\n\nI know this sounds like a lot. I want to be very clear: I have not had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, ashamed sometimes, and stuck in these persistent, self\u2011critical loops that make everyday life heavier than it needs to be.\nDoctor: That sounds so exhausting, Eleanor \u2014 no wonder you feel worn down. You mentioned being slowed and that tasks take much longer: have you or others noticed your movements or speech are noticeably slower than before, or do you sometimes feel restless or fidgety instead? When did you first notice that, and is it something you experience most days?\nPatient: No \u2014 nobody\u2019s told me that my speech or movements are noticeably slower, and I don\u2019t feel restless or fidgety at all. What\u2019s changed is an internal sluggishness: I get low on energy most days, have to stop and rest or take a short nap sometimes, and simple things just take me much longer to finish. It crept in gradually about a year to a year\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half ago and seemed to deepen after I stepped back from the book club. Other people might notice I\u2019m taking more breaks or that tasks stretch out longer, but they wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m clearly slowed in the way I talk or walk \u2014 it\u2019s more that I run out of steam and have to sit down.\nDoctor: That internal sluggishness sounds really draining, Eleanor. Roughly how many hours do you usually sleep at night? Do you have trouble falling asleep, wake during the night, or find you wake earlier than you'd like? Do you generally feel rested when you wake, and how often and for how long do you nap during the day?\nPatient: I usually sleep about seven to eight hours a night and I generally fall asleep without much trouble. I don\u2019t wake up repeatedly during the night and I\u2019m not getting up unusually early, but I rarely feel truly rested when I wake \u2014 mornings feel heavy and sluggish for an hour or two and it takes me a long time to get going. Because of that sluggishness I often need a short rest during the day, usually a brief nap of twenty to forty minutes or just sitting down for a while, and that happens on most days. Sometimes I have to stop halfway through a bit of gardening or a library task to sit down, and those pauses make simple jobs take much longer than they used to. The extra time and the need to rest feed into the self\u2011critical voice \u2014 I end up berating myself for not pushing through, which only makes me more tired and slower. It\u2019s wearing; I\u2019m trying to pace myself, but the fatigue really interferes with finishing things. I want to be clear I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide.\nDoctor: That sounds utterly wearing, Eleanor \u2014 needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed, and it\u2019s completely understandable the fatigue would feed that self\u2011critical voice. I believe you about not having any thoughts of death. Would you like to talk next about ways to manage the guilty thoughts when they start, practical pacing strategies to get through tasks, or how your daughter and neighbours might support you?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 yes, I\u2019d like to focus on that. I want concrete, practical help for the guilty, replaying thoughts and for pacing my days. The rumination hits hardest after social interactions or when I\u2019ve had to take on a role, and again in quiet mornings and evenings when I\u2019m sluggish; being tired makes everything drag, and when a task takes twice as long I immediately berate myself, which just makes me more drained. I need ways to stop that loop in the moment and to plan tasks so they actually get finished without wearing me out.\n\nSpecifically, I\u2019d really appreciate simple, usable techniques such as:\n- Short, calm phrases or language I can use when asking my daughter or Marta for a bit of help that don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m dumping on them or being a burden \u2014 wording that feels natural and not shameful.  \n- Practical pacing steps I can use for chores or gardening: how to break things into bite\u2011sized steps, set realistic priorities, schedule rests, and use timers or checklists so I don\u2019t get overwhelmed and then beat myself up.  \n- A couple of very quick ways to interrupt a negative loop in the moment \u2014 things I can do right away when the replaying starts (simple grounding, a short breathing routine, a brief physical shift), so I don\u2019t spend an hour replaying the same sentence.\n\nI also need reassurance I can lean on: gentle reminders or phrases I can say to myself that rest is not failure, and brief scripts I could use if I feel guilty about slowing down. I\u2019m hopeful that simple, practical tools like these might help me manage the fatigue and the constant self\u2011criticism so I can keep the small things I still enjoy.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear, helpful request, Eleanor \u2014 I can offer three very short, usable toolkits right now.\n\n1) Two brief scripts to ask for help (short, specific, time\u2011limited)\n- \u201cCould you help me for 20 minutes with [task]? That would really help me keep on track.\u201d  \n- \u201cWould you mind sitting with me while I do [task] for half an hour? Having company makes it easier.\u201d  \nBoth name the task and the time so it feels practical, not shameful.\n\n2) Compact pacing plan for chores/gardening (simple steps)\n- Pick 2\u20133 priorities for the day (e.g., meals/meds, one garden job, a short social/chat).  \n- Break each into 15\u201330 minute chunks, set a timer, then schedule a 10\u201315 minute rest after each chunk.  \n- Use a one\u2011line checklist with 3 items and tick them off as you go \u2014 finishing part of an item counts as progress.  \nTip: do the hardest small task when you usually feel least sluggish (often late morning), and give yourself permission to stop early and mark it done for the day.\n\n3) Two very quick ways to interrupt rumination (use immediately)\n- 30\u2011second grounding (5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111): name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste or one slow breath.  \n- 4\u20114\u20114 box breathing or quick physical shift: inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s for 3 cycles \u2014 or stand, stretch, walk to a window and take three slow breaths to change the loop.\n\nA short self\u2011reminder you can say when guilt starts: \u201cRest helps me do what matters \u2014 this isn\u2019t failure.\u201d  \nWhich of these would you like to try now, or would you prefer a written version to take home?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 that already helps, I\u2019m relieved. I\u2019d like to try the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding now, please \u2014 I think naming things will slow my head down a bit. \n\nCould you also give me written copies of all three toolkits to take home so I can practice them later? And would you mind giving me two or three very short, natural scripts I can use with my daughter and with Marta to ask for 10\u201320 minutes of help? Something simple and time\u2011limited that doesn\u2019t sound dramatic \u2014 I\u2019d like one that feels like me asking my daughter and one that feels right for Marta next door.\n\nOne other practical thing: could you show me a concrete example of breaking a single gardening job into 15\u2011minute chunks (for example, weeding one bed or planting a row), and give me a sample one\u2011line checklist I could use in the morning? That kind of concrete plan would make it easier for me to start without spiralling.\n\nFinally, could you give me a couple of alternate short self\u2011reminder phrases I can say when the guilt starts (besides \u201cRest helps me do what matters \u2014 this isn\u2019t failure\u201d)? I\u2019d like two or three different lines I can rotate so they don\u2019t sound like empty words.\n\nI know it\u2019s a lot to ask \u2014 I feel a little emotional saying it \u2014 but I\u2019m hopeful that having these written and simple will help me practice them between visits.\nDoctor: Alright, Eleanor \u2014 let\u2019s do the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding now. Take your time; there\u2019s no rush.\n\n- When you\u2019re ready, slowly name 5 things you can see in the room. (I\u2019ll pause a moment \u2014 go ahead.)\n- Now name 4 things you can touch \u2014 notice their texture. (Pause.)\n- Now 3 things you can hear \u2014 near or far. (Pause.)\n- Name 2 things you can smell \u2014 if you don\u2019t notice smells, name two you like or imagine. (Pause.)\n- Finally, name 1 thing you can taste, or take one slow, deliberate breath and notice it.\n\nWell done \u2014 that often helps slow the head down a bit. I\u2019ll prepare printed copies of the three toolkits for you to take home. Quick questions so I can tailor the scripts and examples: for your daughter, would you prefer a more intimate/warm phrasing or something straightforward? For Marta, do you want a friendly/casual tone? And which gardening task shall I break into 15\u2011minute chunks for you \u2014 weeding one bed or planting a row?\nPatient: (quietly, voice trembling a little) That grounding really did help \u2014 I feel a bit relieved, thank you. Yes, please \u2014 I\u2019d like the wording for my daughter to be intimate and warm, and for Marta to be friendly and casual. Break down \u201cweeding one bed\u201d into 15\u2011minute chunks for me, please. And I\u2019d like printed copies of the three toolkits and two very short, 10\u201320 minute scripts that feel like me to take home. Thank you \u2014 I\u2019m grateful.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve described feeling low a lot \u2014 would you say you feel depressed most of the day nearly every day, or does it come and go with some days much better? On a typical day, about how much of the day would you say you feel that low \u2014 most of it, a few hours, or just briefly now and then?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 it\u2019s most of the day, nearly every day. It\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache that hangs around through much of my waking hours; I\u2019d say about two\u2011thirds to three\u2011quarters of the day feels low \u2014 often after a sluggish morning it settles in and stays with me through the afternoon and into the evening, with only short pockets of relief. Those little things \u2014 a bit of gardening, a short library shift, a cup of tea \u2014 can lift me for a while, but they don\u2019t change the overall low for long. It\u2019s been like this for about a year to a year and a half, and most days I\u2019m also tired and carrying that running, self\u2011critical voice which makes getting things done harder.\nDoctor: Thank you \u2014 that helps me understand. Have you noticed any change in your appetite or weight lately \u2014 eating more or less than usual, or any unintentional weight loss or gain over the past few months?\nPatient: No, my appetite hasn\u2019t changed \u2014 I eat about the same as I always have, breakfast, a light lunch, and dinner, and I haven\u2019t noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain. My weight\u2019s been stable. It\u2019s the fatigue that\u2019s the problem, not eating; I get tired and need to rest, which is what makes things harder to finish. And just to repeat, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve described low energy and naps most days \u2014 how much does that fatigue stop you from doing things you want or need to do? Are there activities you\u2019ve had to give up because of it, and is the tiredness worse at a particular time of day?\nPatient: It stops me a lot \u2014 honestly, fatigue is the single biggest thing getting in the way. I often have to stop halfway through a task and sit down, sometimes for a twenty to forty minute nap, and that\u2019s why what used to take an hour now takes two. I\u2019ll start weeding a bed and have to pause after a short spell; I\u2019ll begin shelving at the library and need to sit with a cup of tea before I can carry on. Those breaks are necessary, but they stretch everything out and leave me feeling ashamed and useless afterward.\n\nSince I stepped back from running the book club I withdrew more. I stepped back entirely from that leadership role and cut my library hours down to very short shifts \u2014 I don\u2019t take on the longer volunteer visits anymore and I sometimes say no to social invitations or larger tasks because I worry I won\u2019t manage. I still do small things \u2014 a short gardening stint, a brief library shift, a cup of tea with my daughter \u2014 but they\u2019re shorter and punctuated by rests. Mornings are the worst: I wake and feel heavy and sluggish for an hour or two, and then there\u2019s often a mid\u2011day or mid\u2011afternoon slump that forces me to nap or stop. That pattern makes it hard to plan my day; I try to pace myself but the tiredness arrives anyway.\n\nThe worst part is the guilt that comes with resting. As soon as I slow down the running commentary starts \u2014 \u201cyou should be doing more,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re letting people down\u201d \u2014 and that self\u2011criticism makes me anxious and saps what little energy I have left. Because of that guilt I avoid things sometimes, and the avoidance makes me feel worse about myself, so it becomes a weary cycle. I\u2019m aware it\u2019s not sensible, and I begrudge myself for needing to sit down, but it\u2019s real and it keeps me from finishing what I want to do.\n\nI\u2019m trying to be realistic about what I can manage and to keep doing the small pleasures that help, but the fatigue really changes how much I can do and how I feel about it. And just so it\u2019s clear \u2014 I have not had any thoughts of death or suicide.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve said the guilty, self\u2011critical voice is constant \u2014 would you say you often feel worthless or excessively guilty about small things or things that aren\u2019t your fault? How strongly do those feelings hit you, and do they make it hard to accept kindness or help from others?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nEleanor, you\u2019ve said the guilty, self\u2011critical voice is constant \u2014 would you say you often feel worthless or excessively guilty about small things or things that aren\u2019t your fault?

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I've been feeling down most days for quite a while now. The low energy makes even small things \u2014 keeping up with the little library shift, tending the vegetable patch for the food pantry, or running the reading group \u2014 feel like a real slog, and since I stepped back from the book club I've felt adrift and more useless than I like to admit. I replay conversations all the time and tell myself I said the wrong thing or that I'm becoming a burden to my daughter; those guilty, self-critical thoughts are constant and leave me feeling worthless. Every so often I have trouble concentrating \u2014 there are days when I can't get through a chapter or I can't decide what needs doing first \u2014 and that indecisiveness makes simple tasks take ages. It's getting in the way of my routines and my ability to follow through on things, which only makes me more anxious and hard on myself. I want to be clear I haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide, but I do feel stuck, tired, and worry a lot about being a bother.\nDoctor: Thank you, Eleanor \u2014 that sounds like a heavy, constant weight, and I really appreciate you telling me. I'm glad you said you haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide. Can you tell me when you first noticed these changes, and are there any moments or small activities that still feel manageable or give you a bit of relief?\nPatient: (her voice a little breathy, a soft sniff) It... it crept up, really \u2014 I suppose I first noticed things changing about a year to a year and a half ago. At first it was little: mornings felt heavier, I\u2019d replay a conversation and feel ashamed longer than I used to. It wasn\u2019t dramatic at first, but after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that was the turning point \u2014 everything seemed to settle into a lower place and it got steadily worse. Losing that steady role left a lot of empty space and I began to worry I was just becoming useless.\n\nMost days now I feel low; it\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache more than anything explosive. The energy just isn\u2019t there much of the time \u2014 even small tasks feel like more effort than they should. I\u2019m tired a lot, and that makes getting out to do things harder. The self-critical thoughts are almost constant: I go over things I said, imagine I\u2019ve been a burden to my daughter, tell myself I shouldn\u2019t be asking for help. Those guilty feelings sap me, and then I get anxious and hard on myself for not doing more.\n\nMy concentration slips only sometimes \u2014 maybe a few days when I can\u2019t focus long enough to finish a chapter or I faff about deciding what to do first \u2014 but when that happens a simple task can take ages and I feel foolish about it. It\u2019s not every day, but when it comes it\u2019s frustrating and feeds the worry that my memory is slipping.\n\nThere are small things that still help and I cling to them. Tending the vegetable patch and my garden gives me something practical and steady \u2014 even a short time out there helps. Short library shifts, just a couple of hours, make me feel useful again. Reading a paragraph of a book or a poem, or having a quick cup of tea with my daughter or with Marta next door, brightens a moment and reminds me I haven\u2019t lost everything I enjoy. Those small bits don\u2019t fix it, but they make the day bearable sometimes.\n\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I know I sound gloomy \u2014 but I want to be clear: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, guilty, and worried, and those feelings make it harder to keep up with the things I used to do.\nDoctor: Eleanor, that sounds exhausting \u2014 a quiet, persistent ache that\u2019s been wearing on you for a long time, and it took real courage to tell me; it makes complete sense you\u2019d hold on to small steady things like the garden, short library shifts, and a cup of tea with your daughter. Thank you for saying you haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death; would it be okay if I asked a few brief questions about your sleep, appetite, and energy so I can understand things better?\nPatient: Yes, that\u2019s fine \u2014 you can ask. I mostly sleep through the night, but mornings are heavy and slow; it takes me a long time to get going and I feel sluggish for an hour or two. My appetite hasn\u2019t changed at all. My energy is low most days \u2014 I tire easily and often need a short rest or even a brief nap \u2014 and that really makes finishing tasks harder; a simple bit of gardening or a library shift can take twice as long because I have to stop and sit down. I know I ought to push through, and I get hard on myself about it, but the fatigue really interferes with getting everything done.\nDoctor: That all sounds so tiring, Eleanor \u2014 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been wearing you down. Besides stepping back from the book club, are there other things you used to enjoy that now feel less interesting? And when you garden or read, do you still get pleasure from them or do they feel more like going through the motions \u2014 has that reduced interest been present most days, and how long has it been like that?\nPatient: No \u2014 I haven\u2019t really lost interest in things overall. Gardening still steadies me and gives me a small lift, and those short library shifts or reading a paragraph or a poem still feel worthwhile. A cup of tea with my daughter or Marta can still brighten a bit of the day. But they often take more effort now; sometimes it feels like I\u2019m going through the motions rather than being fully there, and I have to talk myself into doing them. It\u2019s been gradual \u2014 about a year to a year and a half, and it deepened after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that steady role disappearing left a hole and made everything feel a bit dulled. The fatigue and the constant guilty, self-critical thoughts get in the way of enjoying things properly (her voice cracks a little) \u2014 I slow down, I rest, and then I\u2019m hard on myself for needing to do that, which just makes it harder to really take pleasure in what I still like.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve been really brave to say all that \u2014 it sounds utterly draining, and needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing. It makes sense the small pleasures still help even when they take effort; would you like to tell me more about when those self\u2011critical thoughts are strongest, or would you prefer a moment \u2014 we can go at whatever pace feels right for you.\nPatient: (breathing in, a soft catch) I\u2026 I want to talk about it. The self\u2011critical thoughts are almost constant \u2014 it feels like a running commentary in my head that never really switches off. They\u2019re worst after I\u2019ve been with people or had to take on a role, and then again in the quiet times: evenings when the house is still, or first thing in the morning when I\u2019m slow to get started. Those are the moments when I have time to replay things and the doubts pile up.\n\nI replay conversations all the time \u2014 I\u2019ll go over a chat from the book club or a visit from my daughter and think, \u201cDid I say something stupid? Did I offend them?\u201d Even the smallest remark will loop in my head until I\u2019m convinced I sounded foolish. I keep imagining I\u2019m a burden to my daughter; if she asks to help or checks in, I immediately feel guilty and tell myself I shouldn\u2019t put her out. When I rest \u2014 which I often have to do because I\u2019m tired \u2014 the guilt hits me: I think I should be doing more instead of sitting down, and that makes me hard on myself.\n\nTiredness makes it so much worse. If I\u2019m sluggish in the morning or I\u2019ve had to stop halfway through a task, the thoughts kick in: \u201cYou\u2019re slowing everyone down,\u201d or \u201cYou can\u2019t even finish this.\u201d When jobs pile up or I have a brief lapse in concentration, it feeds a spiral of anxiety and self\u2011reproach. The whole thing is exhausting \u2014 mentally and physically \u2014 and it saps the little energy I have left. Tasks take longer because I stop, berate myself, try again, and then need to rest; it\u2019s a slow, weary cycle.\n\nThose thoughts increase my anxiety and make it harder to be present in things I still enjoy. I can still garden or read a little, and I hold onto those moments, but the joy is dulled because the guilty voice is never far behind telling me I should be doing more. (her voice quavers) It\u2019s humiliating to say, but I worry I\u2019m letting people down, and that worry makes me withdraw a bit and then feel worse about myself.\n\nI know this sounds like a lot. I want to be very clear: I have not had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, ashamed sometimes, and stuck in these persistent, self\u2011critical loops that make everyday life heavier than it needs to be.\nDoctor: That sounds so exhausting, Eleanor \u2014 no wonder you feel worn down. You mentioned being slowed and that tasks take much longer: have you or others noticed your movements or speech are noticeably slower than before, or do you sometimes feel restless or fidgety instead? When did you first notice that, and is it something you experience most days?\nPatient: No \u2014 nobody\u2019s told me that my speech or movements are noticeably slower, and I don\u2019t feel restless or fidgety at all. What\u2019s changed is an internal sluggishness: I get low on energy most days, have to stop and rest or take a short nap sometimes, and simple things just take me much longer to finish. It crept in gradually about a year to a year\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half ago and seemed to deepen after I stepped back from the book club. Other people might notice I\u2019m taking more breaks or that tasks stretch out longer, but they wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m clearly slowed in the way I talk or walk \u2014 it\u2019s more that I run out of steam and have to sit down.\nDoctor: That internal sluggishness sounds really draining, Eleanor. Roughly how many hours do you usually sleep at night? Do you have trouble falling asleep, wake during the night, or find you wake earlier than you'd like? Do you generally feel rested when you wake, and how often and for how long do you nap during the day?\nPatient: I usually sleep about seven to eight hours a night and I generally fall asleep without much trouble. I don\u2019t wake up repeatedly during the night and I\u2019m not getting up unusually early, but I rarely feel truly rested when I wake \u2014 mornings feel heavy and sluggish for an hour or two and it takes me a long time to get going. Because of that sluggishness I often need a short rest during the day, usually a brief nap of twenty to forty minutes or just sitting down for a while, and that happens on most days. Sometimes I have to stop halfway through a bit of gardening or a library task to sit down, and those pauses make simple jobs take much longer than they used to. The extra time and the need to rest feed into the self\u2011critical voice \u2014 I end up berating myself for not pushing through, which only makes me more tired and slower. It\u2019s wearing; I\u2019m trying to pace myself, but the fatigue really interferes with finishing things. I want to be clear I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide.\nDoctor: That sounds utterly wearing, Eleanor \u2014 needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed, and it\u2019s completely understandable the fatigue would feed that self\u2011critical voice. I believe you about not having any thoughts of death. Would you like to talk next about ways to manage the guilty thoughts when they start, practical pacing strategies to get through tasks, or how your daughter and neighbours might support you?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 yes, I\u2019d like to focus on that. I want concrete, practical help for the guilty, replaying thoughts and for pacing my days. The rumination hits hardest after social interactions or when I\u2019ve had to take on a role, and again in quiet mornings and evenings when I\u2019m sluggish; being tired makes everything drag, and when a task takes twice as long I immediately berate myself, which just makes me more drained. I need ways to stop that loop in the moment and to plan tasks so they actually get finished without wearing me out.\n\nSpecifically, I\u2019d really appreciate simple, usable techniques such as:\n- Short, calm phrases or language I can use when asking my daughter or Marta for a bit of help that don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m dumping on them or being a burden \u2014 wording that feels natural and not shameful.  \n- Practical pacing steps I can use for chores or gardening: how to break things into bite\u2011sized steps, set realistic priorities, schedule rests, and use timers or checklists so I don\u2019t get overwhelmed and then beat myself up.  \n- A couple of very quick ways to interrupt a negative loop in the moment \u2014 things I can do right away when the replaying starts (simple grounding, a short breathing routine, a brief physical shift), so I don\u2019t spend an hour replaying the same sentence.\n\nI also need reassurance I can lean on: gentle reminders or phrases I can say to myself that rest is not failure, and brief scripts I could use if I feel guilty about slowing down. I\u2019m hopeful that simple, practical tools like these might help me manage the fatigue and the constant self\u2011criticism so I can keep the small things I still enjoy.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear, helpful request, Eleanor \u2014 I can offer three very short, usable toolkits right now.\n\n1) Two brief scripts to ask for help (short, specific, time\u2011limited)\n- \u201cCould you help me for 20 minutes with [task]? That would really help me keep on track.\u201d  \n- \u201cWould you mind sitting with me while I do [task] for half an hour? Having company makes it easier.\u201d  \nBoth name the task and the time so it feels practical, not shameful.\n\n2) Compact pacing plan for chores/gardening (simple steps)\n- Pick 2\u20133 priorities for the day (e.g., meals/meds, one garden job, a short social/chat).  \n- Break each into 15\u201330 minute chunks, set a timer, then schedule a 10\u201315 minute rest after each chunk.  \n- Use a one\u2011line checklist with 3 items and tick them off as you go \u2014 finishing part of an item counts as progress.  \nTip: do the hardest small task when you usually feel least sluggish (often late morning), and give yourself permission to stop early and mark it done for the day.\n\n3) Two very quick ways to interrupt rumination (use immediately)\n- 30\u2011second grounding (5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111): name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste or one slow breath.  \n- 4\u20114\u20114 box breathing or quick physical shift: inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s for 3 cycles \u2014 or stand, stretch, walk to a window and take three slow breaths to change the loop.\n\nA short self\u2011reminder you can say when guilt starts: \u201cRest helps me do what matters \u2014 this isn\u2019t failure.\u201d  \nWhich of these would you like to try now, or would you prefer a written version to take home?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 that already helps, I\u2019m relieved. I\u2019d like to try the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding now, please \u2014 I think naming things will slow my head down a bit. \n\nCould you also give me written copies of all three toolkits to take home so I can practice them later? And would you mind giving me two or three very short, natural scripts I can use with my daughter and with Marta to ask for 10\u201320 minutes of help? Something simple and time\u2011limited that doesn\u2019t sound dramatic \u2014 I\u2019d like one that feels like me asking my daughter and one that feels right for Marta next door.\n\nOne other practical thing: could you show me a concrete example of breaking a single gardening job into 15\u2011minute chunks (for example, weeding one bed or planting a row), and give me a sample one\u2011line checklist I could use in the morning? That kind of concrete plan would make it easier for me to start without spiralling.\n\nFinally, could you give me a couple of alternate short self\u2011reminder phrases I can say when the guilt starts (besides \u201cRest helps me do what matters \u2014 this isn\u2019t failure\u201d)? I\u2019d like two or three different lines I can rotate so they don\u2019t sound like empty words.\n\nI know it\u2019s a lot to ask \u2014 I feel a little emotional saying it \u2014 but I\u2019m hopeful that having these written and simple will help me practice them between visits.\nDoctor: Alright, Eleanor \u2014 let\u2019s do the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding now. Take your time; there\u2019s no rush.\n\n- When you\u2019re ready, slowly name 5 things you can see in the room. (I\u2019ll pause a moment \u2014 go ahead.)\n- Now name 4 things you can touch \u2014 notice their texture. (Pause.)\n- Now 3 things you can hear \u2014 near or far. (Pause.)\n- Name 2 things you can smell \u2014 if you don\u2019t notice smells, name two you like or imagine. (Pause.)\n- Finally, name 1 thing you can taste, or take one slow, deliberate breath and notice it.\n\nWell done \u2014 that often helps slow the head down a bit. I\u2019ll prepare printed copies of the three toolkits for you to take home. Quick questions so I can tailor the scripts and examples: for your daughter, would you prefer a more intimate/warm phrasing or something straightforward? For Marta, do you want a friendly/casual tone? And which gardening task shall I break into 15\u2011minute chunks for you \u2014 weeding one bed or planting a row?\nPatient: (quietly, voice trembling a little) That grounding really did help \u2014 I feel a bit relieved, thank you. Yes, please \u2014 I\u2019d like the wording for my daughter to be intimate and warm, and for Marta to be friendly and casual. Break down \u201cweeding one bed\u201d into 15\u2011minute chunks for me, please. And I\u2019d like printed copies of the three toolkits and two very short, 10\u201320 minute scripts that feel like me to take home. Thank you \u2014 I\u2019m grateful.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve described feeling low a lot \u2014 would you say you feel depressed most of the day nearly every day, or does it come and go with some days much better? On a typical day, about how much of the day would you say you feel that low \u2014 most of it, a few hours, or just briefly now and then?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 it\u2019s most of the day, nearly every day. It\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache that hangs around through much of my waking hours; I\u2019d say about two\u2011thirds to three\u2011quarters of the day feels low \u2014 often after a sluggish morning it settles in and stays with me through the afternoon and into the evening, with only short pockets of relief. Those little things \u2014 a bit of gardening, a short library shift, a cup of tea \u2014 can lift me for a while, but they don\u2019t change the overall low for long. It\u2019s been like this for about a year to a year and a half, and most days I\u2019m also tired and carrying that running, self\u2011critical voice which makes getting things done harder.\nDoctor: Thank you \u2014 that helps me understand. Have you noticed any change in your appetite or weight lately \u2014 eating more or less than usual, or any unintentional weight loss or gain over the past few months?\nPatient: No, my appetite hasn\u2019t changed \u2014 I eat about the same as I always have, breakfast, a light lunch, and dinner, and I haven\u2019t noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain. My weight\u2019s been stable. It\u2019s the fatigue that\u2019s the problem, not eating; I get tired and need to rest, which is what makes things harder to finish. And just to repeat, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve described low energy and naps most days \u2014 how much does that fatigue stop you from doing things you want or need to do? Are there activities you\u2019ve had to give up because of it, and is the tiredness worse at a particular time of day?\nPatient: It stops me a lot \u2014 honestly, fatigue is the single biggest thing getting in the way. I often have to stop halfway through a task and sit down, sometimes for a twenty to forty minute nap, and that\u2019s why what used to take an hour now takes two. I\u2019ll start weeding a bed and have to pause after a short spell; I\u2019ll begin shelving at the library and need to sit with a cup of tea before I can carry on. Those breaks are necessary, but they stretch everything out and leave me feeling ashamed and useless afterward.\n\nSince I stepped back from running the book club I withdrew more. I stepped back entirely from that leadership role and cut my library hours down to very short shifts \u2014 I don\u2019t take on the longer volunteer visits anymore and I sometimes say no to social invitations or larger tasks because I worry I won\u2019t manage. I still do small things \u2014 a short gardening stint, a brief library shift, a cup of tea with my daughter \u2014 but they\u2019re shorter and punctuated by rests. Mornings are the worst: I wake and feel heavy and sluggish for an hour or two, and then there\u2019s often a mid\u2011day or mid\u2011afternoon slump that forces me to nap or stop. That pattern makes it hard to plan my day; I try to pace myself but the tiredness arrives anyway.\n\nThe worst part is the guilt that comes with resting. As soon as I slow down the running commentary starts \u2014 \u201cyou should be doing more,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re letting people down\u201d \u2014 and that self\u2011criticism makes me anxious and saps what little energy I have left. Because of that guilt I avoid things sometimes, and the avoidance makes me feel worse about myself, so it becomes a weary cycle. I\u2019m aware it\u2019s not sensible, and I begrudge myself for needing to sit down, but it\u2019s real and it keeps me from finishing what I want to do.\n\nI\u2019m trying to be realistic about what I can manage and to keep doing the small pleasures that help, but the fatigue really changes how much I can do and how I feel about it. And just so it\u2019s clear \u2014 I have not had any thoughts of death or suicide.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve said the guilty, self\u2011critical voice is constant \u2014 would you say you often feel worthless or excessively guilty about small things or things that aren\u2019t your fault? How strongly do those feelings hit you, and do they make it hard to accept kindness or help from others?\nPatient: (voice a little shaky) Yes \u2014 I do feel worthless and excessively guilty about small things, and it\u2019s become almost a constant undertow. The feelings come up so quickly and strongly that I\u2019ll replay a short conversation for hours, convinced I said something wrong or that I\u2019ve been a bother. They\u2019re worst after I\u2019ve been with people or in the quiet evenings when I have time to ruminate.\n\nThey hit hard enough that I\u2019ll apologise or minimise the moment my daughter checks in \u2014 I\u2019ll say \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d even when I\u2019m not, or I\u2019ll turn down offers of help because I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll be imposing. I appreciate the kindness when it happens, but afterwards I feel ashamed that I asked or that I needed anything at all.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I've been feeling down most days for quite a while now. The low energy makes even small things \u2014 keeping up with the little library shift, tending the vegetable patch for the food pantry, or running the reading group \u2014 feel like a real slog, and since I stepped back from the book club I've felt adrift and more useless than I like to admit. I replay conversations all the time and tell myself I said the wrong thing or that I'm becoming a burden to my daughter; those guilty, self-critical thoughts are constant and leave me feeling worthless. Every so often I have trouble concentrating \u2014 there are days when I can't get through a chapter or I can't decide what needs doing first \u2014 and that indecisiveness makes simple tasks take ages. It's getting in the way of my routines and my ability to follow through on things, which only makes me more anxious and hard on myself. I want to be clear I haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide, but I do feel stuck, tired, and worry a lot about being a bother.\nDoctor: Thank you, Eleanor \u2014 that sounds like a heavy, constant weight, and I really appreciate you telling me. I'm glad you said you haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide. Can you tell me when you first noticed these changes, and are there any moments or small activities that still feel manageable or give you a bit of relief?\nPatient: (her voice a little breathy, a soft sniff) It... it crept up, really \u2014 I suppose I first noticed things changing about a year to a year and a half ago. At first it was little: mornings felt heavier, I\u2019d replay a conversation and feel ashamed longer than I used to. It wasn\u2019t dramatic at first, but after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that was the turning point \u2014 everything seemed to settle into a lower place and it got steadily worse. Losing that steady role left a lot of empty space and I began to worry I was just becoming useless.\n\nMost days now I feel low; it\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache more than anything explosive. The energy just isn\u2019t there much of the time \u2014 even small tasks feel like more effort than they should. I\u2019m tired a lot, and that makes getting out to do things harder. The self-critical thoughts are almost constant: I go over things I said, imagine I\u2019ve been a burden to my daughter, tell myself I shouldn\u2019t be asking for help. Those guilty feelings sap me, and then I get anxious and hard on myself for not doing more.\n\nMy concentration slips only sometimes \u2014 maybe a few days when I can\u2019t focus long enough to finish a chapter or I faff about deciding what to do first \u2014 but when that happens a simple task can take ages and I feel foolish about it. It\u2019s not every day, but when it comes it\u2019s frustrating and feeds the worry that my memory is slipping.\n\nThere are small things that still help and I cling to them. Tending the vegetable patch and my garden gives me something practical and steady \u2014 even a short time out there helps. Short library shifts, just a couple of hours, make me feel useful again. Reading a paragraph of a book or a poem, or having a quick cup of tea with my daughter or with Marta next door, brightens a moment and reminds me I haven\u2019t lost everything I enjoy. Those small bits don\u2019t fix it, but they make the day bearable sometimes.\n\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I know I sound gloomy \u2014 but I want to be clear: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, guilty, and worried, and those feelings make it harder to keep up with the things I used to do.\nDoctor: Eleanor, that sounds exhausting \u2014 a quiet, persistent ache that\u2019s been wearing on you for a long time, and it took real courage to tell me; it makes complete sense you\u2019d hold on to small steady things like the garden, short library shifts, and a cup of tea with your daughter. Thank you for saying you haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death; would it be okay if I asked a few brief questions about your sleep, appetite, and energy so I can understand things better?\nPatient: Yes, that\u2019s fine \u2014 you can ask. I mostly sleep through the night, but mornings are heavy and slow; it takes me a long time to get going and I feel sluggish for an hour or two. My appetite hasn\u2019t changed at all. My energy is low most days \u2014 I tire easily and often need a short rest or even a brief nap \u2014 and that really makes finishing tasks harder; a simple bit of gardening or a library shift can take twice as long because I have to stop and sit down. I know I ought to push through, and I get hard on myself about it, but the fatigue really interferes with getting everything done.\nDoctor: That all sounds so tiring, Eleanor \u2014 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been wearing you down. Besides stepping back from the book club, are there other things you used to enjoy that now feel less interesting? And when you garden or read, do you still get pleasure from them or do they feel more like going through the motions \u2014 has that reduced interest been present most days, and how long has it been like that?\nPatient: No \u2014 I haven\u2019t really lost interest in things overall. Gardening still steadies me and gives me a small lift, and those short library shifts or reading a paragraph or a poem still feel worthwhile. A cup of tea with my daughter or Marta can still brighten a bit of the day. But they often take more effort now; sometimes it feels like I\u2019m going through the motions rather than being fully there, and I have to talk myself into doing them. It\u2019s been gradual \u2014 about a year to a year and a half, and it deepened after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that steady role disappearing left a hole and made everything feel a bit dulled. The fatigue and the constant guilty, self-critical thoughts get in the way of enjoying things properly (her voice cracks a little) \u2014 I slow down, I rest, and then I\u2019m hard on myself for needing to do that, which just makes it harder to really take pleasure in what I still like.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve been really brave to say all that \u2014 it sounds utterly draining, and needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing. It makes sense the small pleasures still help even when they take effort; would you like to tell me more about when those self\u2011critical thoughts are strongest, or would you prefer a moment \u2014 we can go at whatever pace feels right for you.\nPatient: (breathing in, a soft catch) I\u2026 I want to talk about it. The self\u2011critical thoughts are almost constant \u2014 it feels like a running commentary in my head that never really switches off. They\u2019re worst after I\u2019ve been with people or had to take on a role, and then again in the quiet times: evenings when the house is still, or first thing in the morning when I\u2019m slow to get started. Those are the moments when I have time to replay things and the doubts pile up.\n\nI replay conversations all the time \u2014 I\u2019ll go over a chat from the book club or a visit from my daughter and think, \u201cDid I say something stupid? Did I offend them?\u201d Even the smallest remark will loop in my head until I\u2019m convinced I sounded foolish. I keep imagining I\u2019m a burden to my daughter; if she asks to help or checks in, I immediately feel guilty and tell myself I shouldn\u2019t put her out. When I rest \u2014 which I often have to do because I\u2019m tired \u2014 the guilt hits me: I think I should be doing more instead of sitting down, and that makes me hard on myself.\n\nTiredness makes it so much worse. If I\u2019m sluggish in the morning or I\u2019ve had to stop halfway through a task, the thoughts kick in: \u201cYou\u2019re slowing everyone down,\u201d or \u201cYou can\u2019t even finish this.\u201d When jobs pile up or I have a brief lapse in concentration, it feeds a spiral of anxiety and self\u2011reproach. The whole thing is exhausting \u2014 mentally and physically \u2014 and it saps the little energy I have left. Tasks take longer because I stop, berate myself, try again, and then need to rest; it\u2019s a slow, weary cycle.\n\nThose thoughts increase my anxiety and make it harder to be present in things I still enjoy. I can still garden or read a little, and I hold onto those moments, but the joy is dulled because the guilty voice is never far behind telling me I should be doing more. (her voice quavers) It\u2019s humiliating to say, but I worry I\u2019m letting people down, and that worry makes me withdraw a bit and then feel worse about myself.\n\nI know this sounds like a lot. I want to be very clear: I have not had any thoughts of death or suicide. I\u2019m just tired, ashamed sometimes, and stuck in these persistent, self\u2011critical loops that make everyday life heavier than it needs to be.\nDoctor: That sounds so exhausting, Eleanor \u2014 no wonder you feel worn down. You mentioned being slowed and that tasks take much longer: have you or others noticed your movements or speech are noticeably slower than before, or do you sometimes feel restless or fidgety instead? When did you first notice that, and is it something you experience most days?\nPatient: No \u2014 nobody\u2019s told me that my speech or movements are noticeably slower, and I don\u2019t feel restless or fidgety at all. What\u2019s changed is an internal sluggishness: I get low on energy most days, have to stop and rest or take a short nap sometimes, and simple things just take me much longer to finish. It crept in gradually about a year to a year\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half ago and seemed to deepen after I stepped back from the book club. Other people might notice I\u2019m taking more breaks or that tasks stretch out longer, but they wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m clearly slowed in the way I talk or walk \u2014 it\u2019s more that I run out of steam and have to sit down.\nDoctor: That internal sluggishness sounds really draining, Eleanor. Roughly how many hours do you usually sleep at night? Do you have trouble falling asleep, wake during the night, or find you wake earlier than you'd like? Do you generally feel rested when you wake, and how often and for how long do you nap during the day?\nPatient: I usually sleep about seven to eight hours a night and I generally fall asleep without much trouble. I don\u2019t wake up repeatedly during the night and I\u2019m not getting up unusually early, but I rarely feel truly rested when I wake \u2014 mornings feel heavy and sluggish for an hour or two and it takes me a long time to get going. Because of that sluggishness I often need a short rest during the day, usually a brief nap of twenty to forty minutes or just sitting down for a while, and that happens on most days. Sometimes I have to stop halfway through a bit of gardening or a library task to sit down, and those pauses make simple jobs take much longer than they used to. The extra time and the need to rest feed into the self\u2011critical voice \u2014 I end up berating myself for not pushing through, which only makes me more tired and slower. It\u2019s wearing; I\u2019m trying to pace myself, but the fatigue really interferes with finishing things. I want to be clear I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide.\nDoctor: That sounds utterly wearing, Eleanor \u2014 needing to rest doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed, and it\u2019s completely understandable the fatigue would feed that self\u2011critical voice. I believe you about not having any thoughts of death. Would you like to talk next about ways to manage the guilty thoughts when they start, practical pacing strategies to get through tasks, or how your daughter and neighbours might support you?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 yes, I\u2019d like to focus on that. I want concrete, practical help for the guilty, replaying thoughts and for pacing my days. The rumination hits hardest after social interactions or when I\u2019ve had to take on a role, and again in quiet mornings and evenings when I\u2019m sluggish; being tired makes everything drag, and when a task takes twice as long I immediately berate myself, which just makes me more drained. I need ways to stop that loop in the moment and to plan tasks so they actually get finished without wearing me out.\n\nSpecifically, I\u2019d really appreciate simple, usable techniques such as:\n- Short, calm phrases or language I can use when asking my daughter or Marta for a bit of help that don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m dumping on them or being a burden \u2014 wording that feels natural and not shameful.  \n- Practical pacing steps I can use for chores or gardening: how to break things into bite\u2011sized steps, set realistic priorities, schedule rests, and use timers or checklists so I don\u2019t get overwhelmed and then beat myself up.  \n- A couple of very quick ways to interrupt a negative loop in the moment \u2014 things I can do right away when the replaying starts (simple grounding, a short breathing routine, a brief physical shift), so I don\u2019t spend an hour replaying the same sentence.\n\nI also need reassurance I can lean on: gentle reminders or phrases I can say to myself that rest is not failure, and brief scripts I could use if I feel guilty about slowing down. I\u2019m hopeful that simple, practical tools like these might help me manage the fatigue and the constant self\u2011criticism so I can keep the small things I still enjoy.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear, helpful request, Eleanor \u2014 I can offer three very short, usable toolkits right now.\n\n1) Two brief scripts to ask for help (short, specific, time\u2011limited)\n- \u201cCould you help me for 20 minutes with [task]? That would really help me keep on track.\u201d  \n- \u201cWould you mind sitting with me while I do [task] for half an hour? Having company makes it easier.\u201d  \nBoth name the task and the time so it feels practical, not shameful.\n\n2) Compact pacing plan for chores/gardening (simple steps)\n- Pick 2\u20133 priorities for the day (e.g., meals/meds, one garden job, a short social/chat).  \n- Break each into 15\u201330 minute chunks, set a timer, then schedule a 10\u201315 minute rest after each chunk.  \n- Use a one\u2011line checklist with 3 items and tick them off as you go \u2014 finishing part of an item counts as progress.  \nTip: do the hardest small task when you usually feel least sluggish (often late morning), and give yourself permission to stop early and mark it done for the day.\n\n3) Two very quick ways to interrupt rumination (use immediately)\n- 30\u2011second grounding (5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111): name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste or one slow breath.  \n- 4\u20114\u20114 box breathing or quick physical shift: inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s for 3 cycles \u2014 or stand, stretch, walk to a window and take three slow breaths to change the loop.\n\nA short self\u2011reminder you can say when guilt starts: \u201cRest helps me do what matters \u2014 this isn\u2019t failure.\u201d  \nWhich of these would you like to try now, or would you prefer a written version to take home?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 that already helps, I\u2019m relieved. I\u2019d like to try the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding now, please \u2014 I think naming things will slow my head down a bit. \n\nCould you also give me written copies of all three toolkits to take home so I can practice them later? And would you mind giving me two or three very short, natural scripts I can use with my daughter and with Marta to ask for 10\u201320 minutes of help? Something simple and time\u2011limited that doesn\u2019t sound dramatic \u2014 I\u2019d like one that feels like me asking my daughter and one that feels right for Marta next door.\n\nOne other practical thing: could you show me a concrete example of breaking a single gardening job into 15\u2011minute chunks (for example, weeding one bed or planting a row), and give me a sample one\u2011line checklist I could use in the morning? That kind of concrete plan would make it easier for me to start without spiralling.\n\nFinally, could you give me a couple of alternate short self\u2011reminder phrases I can say when the guilt starts (besides \u201cRest helps me do what matters \u2014 this isn\u2019t failure\u201d)? I\u2019d like two or three different lines I can rotate so they don\u2019t sound like empty words.\n\nI know it\u2019s a lot to ask \u2014 I feel a little emotional saying it \u2014 but I\u2019m hopeful that having these written and simple will help me practice them between visits.\nDoctor: Alright, Eleanor \u2014 let\u2019s do the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding now. Take your time; there\u2019s no rush.\n\n- When you\u2019re ready, slowly name 5 things you can see in the room. (I\u2019ll pause a moment \u2014 go ahead.)\n- Now name 4 things you can touch \u2014 notice their texture. (Pause.)\n- Now 3 things you can hear \u2014 near or far. (Pause.)\n- Name 2 things you can smell \u2014 if you don\u2019t notice smells, name two you like or imagine. (Pause.)\n- Finally, name 1 thing you can taste, or take one slow, deliberate breath and notice it.\n\nWell done \u2014 that often helps slow the head down a bit. I\u2019ll prepare printed copies of the three toolkits for you to take home. Quick questions so I can tailor the scripts and examples: for your daughter, would you prefer a more intimate/warm phrasing or something straightforward? For Marta, do you want a friendly/casual tone? And which gardening task shall I break into 15\u2011minute chunks for you \u2014 weeding one bed or planting a row?\nPatient: (quietly, voice trembling a little) That grounding really did help \u2014 I feel a bit relieved, thank you. Yes, please \u2014 I\u2019d like the wording for my daughter to be intimate and warm, and for Marta to be friendly and casual. Break down \u201cweeding one bed\u201d into 15\u2011minute chunks for me, please. And I\u2019d like printed copies of the three toolkits and two very short, 10\u201320 minute scripts that feel like me to take home. Thank you \u2014 I\u2019m grateful.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve described feeling low a lot \u2014 would you say you feel depressed most of the day nearly every day, or does it come and go with some days much better? On a typical day, about how much of the day would you say you feel that low \u2014 most of it, a few hours, or just briefly now and then?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 it\u2019s most of the day, nearly every day. It\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache that hangs around through much of my waking hours; I\u2019d say about two\u2011thirds to three\u2011quarters of the day feels low \u2014 often after a sluggish morning it settles in and stays with me through the afternoon and into the evening, with only short pockets of relief. Those little things \u2014 a bit of gardening, a short library shift, a cup of tea \u2014 can lift me for a while, but they don\u2019t change the overall low for long. It\u2019s been like this for about a year to a year and a half, and most days I\u2019m also tired and carrying that running, self\u2011critical voice which makes getting things done harder.\nDoctor: Thank you \u2014 that helps me understand. Have you noticed any change in your appetite or weight lately \u2014 eating more or less than usual, or any unintentional weight loss or gain over the past few months?\nPatient: No, my appetite hasn\u2019t changed \u2014 I eat about the same as I always have, breakfast, a light lunch, and dinner, and I haven\u2019t noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain. My weight\u2019s been stable. It\u2019s the fatigue that\u2019s the problem, not eating; I get tired and need to rest, which is what makes things harder to finish. And just to repeat, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve described low energy and naps most days \u2014 how much does that fatigue stop you from doing things you want or need to do? Are there activities you\u2019ve had to give up because of it, and is the tiredness worse at a particular time of day?\nPatient: It stops me a lot \u2014 honestly, fatigue is the single biggest thing getting in the way. I often have to stop halfway through a task and sit down, sometimes for a twenty to forty minute nap, and that\u2019s why what used to take an hour now takes two. I\u2019ll start weeding a bed and have to pause after a short spell; I\u2019ll begin shelving at the library and need to sit with a cup of tea before I can carry on. Those breaks are necessary, but they stretch everything out and leave me feeling ashamed and useless afterward.\n\nSince I stepped back from running the book club I withdrew more. I stepped back entirely from that leadership role and cut my library hours down to very short shifts \u2014 I don\u2019t take on the longer volunteer visits anymore and I sometimes say no to social invitations or larger tasks because I worry I won\u2019t manage. I still do small things \u2014 a short gardening stint, a brief library shift, a cup of tea with my daughter \u2014 but they\u2019re shorter and punctuated by rests. Mornings are the worst: I wake and feel heavy and sluggish for an hour or two, and then there\u2019s often a mid\u2011day or mid\u2011afternoon slump that forces me to nap or stop. That pattern makes it hard to plan my day; I try to pace myself but the tiredness arrives anyway.\n\nThe worst part is the guilt that comes with resting. As soon as I slow down the running commentary starts \u2014 \u201cyou should be doing more,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re letting people down\u201d \u2014 and that self\u2011criticism makes me anxious and saps what little energy I have left. Because of that guilt I avoid things sometimes, and the avoidance makes me feel worse about myself, so it becomes a weary cycle. I\u2019m aware it\u2019s not sensible, and I begrudge myself for needing to sit down, but it\u2019s real and it keeps me from finishing what I want to do.\n\nI\u2019m trying to be realistic about what I can manage and to keep doing the small pleasures that help, but the fatigue really changes how much I can do and how I feel about it. And just so it\u2019s clear \u2014 I have not had any thoughts of death or suicide.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you\u2019ve said the guilty, self\u2011critical voice is constant \u2014 would you say you often feel worthless or excessively guilty about small things or things that aren\u2019t your fault? How strongly do those feelings hit you, and do they make it hard to accept kindness or help from others?\nPatient: (voice a little shaky) Yes \u2014 I do feel worthless and excessively guilty about small things, and it\u2019s become almost a constant undertow. The feelings come up so quickly and strongly that I\u2019ll replay a short conversation for hours, convinced I said something wrong or that I\u2019ve been a bother. They\u2019re worst after I\u2019ve been with people or in the quiet evenings when I have time to ruminate.\n\nThey hit hard enough that I\u2019ll apologise or minimise the moment my daughter checks in \u2014 I\u2019ll say \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d even when I\u2019m not, or I\u2019ll turn down offers of help because I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll be imposing. I appreciate the kindness when it happens, but afterwards I feel ashamed that I asked or that I needed anything at all. Sometimes I try to do a little extra for people straight away because it feels like the only way to \u201cpay them back,\u201d which only wears me out more.\n\nThose feelings really get in the way of accepting practical help. If Marta offers to stay and chat while I weed, I\u2019m grateful, but then I\u2019m embarrassed and worry I\u2019m taking advantage; that makes it harder to let her actually help. It\u2019s a tiring cycle \u2014 the guilt reduces my energy, makes me avoid or shorten things, and then I feel worse for not doing more.\n\nI want to be clear again: I have not had any thoughts of death or suicide.\nDoctor: Eleanor, you mentioned sometimes losing your place in a chapter and faffing about deciding what to do first \u2014 lately, how often do you have trouble concentrating or making even small decisions, and is that happening most days? Does this interfere with important things like remembering appointments, taking medication, or managing bills, or is it mostly slowing down everyday tasks?\nPatient: It\u2019s only occasional \u2014 not most days. Maybe a couple of times a week when I\u2019m especially tired, or sometimes less; usually it\u2019s when I\u2019ve had a poor morning or I\u2019m mid\u2011afternoon and worn out. Typical moments are losing my place in a chapter, faffing about for longer than I should over what to do next, or starting a task and then spending ages deciding how to begin. It slows things down, makes chores and gardening take twice as long, but it hasn\u2019t stopped me from the important stuff \u2014 I still remember my medicines, keep appointments, and manage the bills. When it does happen I feel foolish and guilty about it, and that self\u2011criticism just makes me more sluggish and tired.\nDoctor: Eleanor, thank you for saying that \u2014 I want to gently check one more time: have you ever had thoughts that you\u2019d be better off dead, or any thoughts of harming yourself, even briefly or in passing? If you have, have you ever had any plan or thought about how you might do that?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nEleanor, thank you for saying that \u2014 I want to gently check one more time: have you ever had thoughts that you\u2019d be better off dead, or any thoughts of harming yourself, even briefly or in passing?
