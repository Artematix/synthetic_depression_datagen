Do not default to late 20s/early 30s. Create facets appropriate to the patient's life stage.\n- Make sure all information you create is compatible with the depression symptom profile. Higher symptom severity should show up as more impact on daily life, relationships, or goals. Lower severity should feel milder.\n- Keep trauma and serious adversity realistic and not universal. Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)?

I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes.

I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nMartin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\n\nTask:\nDecide how the patient should respond next and output JSON only.",

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy.

I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nMartin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)?

It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nNot often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)?

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nYes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days.

Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)?

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nAbout three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure.

I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\nDoctor: You mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nYou mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\n\nTask:\nDecide how the patient should respond next and output JSON only.",

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)?

Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\nDoctor: You mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\nPatient: Both happen. The restless pacing occurs several nights a week \u2014 when I\u2019m stuck replaying things I\u2019ll get up and pace in short bursts multiple times a night. The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps. The kids have pointed out I\u2019m snappier and slower lately, and it definitely gets worse with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating. There aren\u2019t any new medications or medical issues that would explain it.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nBoth happen.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\nDoctor: You mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\nPatient: Both happen. The restless pacing occurs several nights a week \u2014 when I\u2019m stuck replaying things I\u2019ll get up and pace in short bursts multiple times a night. The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\nDoctor: You mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\nPatient: Both happen. The restless pacing occurs several nights a week \u2014 when I\u2019m stuck replaying things I\u2019ll get up and pace in short bursts multiple times a night. The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps. The kids have pointed out I\u2019m snappier and slower lately, and it definitely gets worse with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating. There aren\u2019t any new medications or medical issues that would explain it.\nDoctor: Martin, what are your usual bedtime and wake time, and how many hours do you sleep on a good night versus a bad night; how long does it take you to fall asleep, how many times do you wake each night and about how long are you awake when you do? \n\nDo you tend to wake earlier than you want, do you nap (how long), and do you use alcohol or any sleep medicines to help fall asleep? \n\nHow much do these sleep problems interfere with caregiving or safety (for example delayed morning routines, medication mistakes, or driving)? Improving sleep often helps mood and concentration \u2014 would you be willing to try some short-term sleep strategies now or consider further sleep-focused treatment?\nPatient: Usually I go to bed around 11:00 pm and get up about 6:30 am. On a decent night I get six to seven hours; on a bad night I\u2019ll only get two to three. It typically takes me 45\u201390 minutes to fall asleep.\n\nI wake multiple times most nights \u2014 a few short awakenings or a couple longer ones \u2014 and on bad nights I\u2019m cumulatively awake for 30 to 120-plus minutes.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\nDoctor: You mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\nPatient: Both happen. The restless pacing occurs several nights a week \u2014 when I\u2019m stuck replaying things I\u2019ll get up and pace in short bursts multiple times a night. The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps. The kids have pointed out I\u2019m snappier and slower lately, and it definitely gets worse with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating. There aren\u2019t any new medications or medical issues that would explain it.\nDoctor: Martin, what are your usual bedtime and wake time, and how many hours do you sleep on a good night versus a bad night; how long does it take you to fall asleep, how many times do you wake each night and about how long are you awake when you do? \n\nDo you tend to wake earlier than you want, do you nap (how long), and do you use alcohol or any sleep medicines to help fall asleep? \n\nHow much do these sleep problems interfere with caregiving or safety (for example delayed morning routines, medication mistakes, or driving)? Improving sleep often helps mood and concentration \u2014 would you be willing to try some short-term sleep strategies now or consider further sleep-focused treatment?\nPatient: Usually I go to bed around 11:00 pm and get up about 6:30 am. On a decent night I get six to seven hours; on a bad night I\u2019ll only get two to three. It typically takes me 45\u201390 minutes to fall asleep.\n\nI wake multiple times most nights \u2014 a few short awakenings or a couple longer ones \u2014 and on bad nights I\u2019m cumulatively awake for 30 to 120-plus minutes. Sometimes I wake up early, around 4 or 5 am, and lie there replaying things. I almost never nap during the day.\n\nI do have a drink or two a few nights a week and I\u2019ve used alcohol sometimes to try to sleep, especially on bad nights, but I don\u2019t take sleep meds regularly. \n\nThe poor sleep delays my mornings, leads to extra checking and pacing, and makes mornings slower and clumsier \u2014 chores and med management take more time and effort (some to moderate interference), though I still get most tasks done. I\u2019ll try short\u2011term sleep strategies now and I\u2019m open to more sleep\u2011focused treatment if that\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks \u2014 I appreciate your willingness to try this. Would you like me to contact Rita right now to ask her to secure or remove the medications tonight, or will you put them in a lockbox or otherwise secure them yourself? \n\nCan you confirm you\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and that you accept a brief check\u2011in from Rita tonight? Which one or two short sleep strategies would you be willing to try tonight \u2014 for example a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed, leaving the bed after about 20\u201330 minutes awake to do a quiet activity, and limiting screens/caffeine after mid\u2011afternoon \u2014 which of those (or others) do you prefer? \n\nFinally, do you feel safe being alone tonight, or would you like me to arrange any additional support this evening?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThanks \u2014 I appreciate your willingness to try this.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\nDoctor: You mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\nPatient: Both happen. The restless pacing occurs several nights a week \u2014 when I\u2019m stuck replaying things I\u2019ll get up and pace in short bursts multiple times a night. The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps. The kids have pointed out I\u2019m snappier and slower lately, and it definitely gets worse with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating. There aren\u2019t any new medications or medical issues that would explain it.\nDoctor: Martin, what are your usual bedtime and wake time, and how many hours do you sleep on a good night versus a bad night; how long does it take you to fall asleep, how many times do you wake each night and about how long are you awake when you do? \n\nDo you tend to wake earlier than you want, do you nap (how long), and do you use alcohol or any sleep medicines to help fall asleep? \n\nHow much do these sleep problems interfere with caregiving or safety (for example delayed morning routines, medication mistakes, or driving)? Improving sleep often helps mood and concentration \u2014 would you be willing to try some short-term sleep strategies now or consider further sleep-focused treatment?\nPatient: Usually I go to bed around 11:00 pm and get up about 6:30 am. On a decent night I get six to seven hours; on a bad night I\u2019ll only get two to three. It typically takes me 45\u201390 minutes to fall asleep.\n\nI wake multiple times most nights \u2014 a few short awakenings or a couple longer ones \u2014 and on bad nights I\u2019m cumulatively awake for 30 to 120-plus minutes. Sometimes I wake up early, around 4 or 5 am, and lie there replaying things. I almost never nap during the day.\n\nI do have a drink or two a few nights a week and I\u2019ve used alcohol sometimes to try to sleep, especially on bad nights, but I don\u2019t take sleep meds regularly. \n\nThe poor sleep delays my mornings, leads to extra checking and pacing, and makes mornings slower and clumsier \u2014 chores and med management take more time and effort (some to moderate interference), though I still get most tasks done. I\u2019ll try short\u2011term sleep strategies now and I\u2019m open to more sleep\u2011focused treatment if that\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks \u2014 I appreciate your willingness to try this. Would you like me to contact Rita right now to ask her to secure or remove the medications tonight, or will you put them in a lockbox or otherwise secure them yourself? \n\nCan you confirm you\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and that you accept a brief check\u2011in from Rita tonight?

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\nDoctor: You mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\nPatient: Both happen. The restless pacing occurs several nights a week \u2014 when I\u2019m stuck replaying things I\u2019ll get up and pace in short bursts multiple times a night. The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps. The kids have pointed out I\u2019m snappier and slower lately, and it definitely gets worse with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating. There aren\u2019t any new medications or medical issues that would explain it.\nDoctor: Martin, what are your usual bedtime and wake time, and how many hours do you sleep on a good night versus a bad night; how long does it take you to fall asleep, how many times do you wake each night and about how long are you awake when you do? \n\nDo you tend to wake earlier than you want, do you nap (how long), and do you use alcohol or any sleep medicines to help fall asleep? \n\nHow much do these sleep problems interfere with caregiving or safety (for example delayed morning routines, medication mistakes, or driving)? Improving sleep often helps mood and concentration \u2014 would you be willing to try some short-term sleep strategies now or consider further sleep-focused treatment?\nPatient: Usually I go to bed around 11:00 pm and get up about 6:30 am. On a decent night I get six to seven hours; on a bad night I\u2019ll only get two to three. It typically takes me 45\u201390 minutes to fall asleep.\n\nI wake multiple times most nights \u2014 a few short awakenings or a couple longer ones \u2014 and on bad nights I\u2019m cumulatively awake for 30 to 120-plus minutes. Sometimes I wake up early, around 4 or 5 am, and lie there replaying things. I almost never nap during the day.\n\nI do have a drink or two a few nights a week and I\u2019ve used alcohol sometimes to try to sleep, especially on bad nights, but I don\u2019t take sleep meds regularly. \n\nThe poor sleep delays my mornings, leads to extra checking and pacing, and makes mornings slower and clumsier \u2014 chores and med management take more time and effort (some to moderate interference), though I still get most tasks done. I\u2019ll try short\u2011term sleep strategies now and I\u2019m open to more sleep\u2011focused treatment if that\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks \u2014 I appreciate your willingness to try this. Would you like me to contact Rita right now to ask her to secure or remove the medications tonight, or will you put them in a lockbox or otherwise secure them yourself? \n\nCan you confirm you\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and that you accept a brief check\u2011in from Rita tonight? Which one or two short sleep strategies would you be willing to try tonight \u2014 for example a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed, leaving the bed after about 20\u201330 minutes awake to do a quiet activity, and limiting screens/caffeine after mid\u2011afternoon \u2014 which of those (or others) do you prefer? \n\nFinally, do you feel safe being alone tonight, or would you like me to arrange any additional support this evening?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 please contact Rita now to secure or remove the medications tonight.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\nDoctor: You mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\nPatient: Both happen. The restless pacing occurs several nights a week \u2014 when I\u2019m stuck replaying things I\u2019ll get up and pace in short bursts multiple times a night. The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps. The kids have pointed out I\u2019m snappier and slower lately, and it definitely gets worse with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating. There aren\u2019t any new medications or medical issues that would explain it.\nDoctor: Martin, what are your usual bedtime and wake time, and how many hours do you sleep on a good night versus a bad night; how long does it take you to fall asleep, how many times do you wake each night and about how long are you awake when you do? \n\nDo you tend to wake earlier than you want, do you nap (how long), and do you use alcohol or any sleep medicines to help fall asleep? \n\nHow much do these sleep problems interfere with caregiving or safety (for example delayed morning routines, medication mistakes, or driving)? Improving sleep often helps mood and concentration \u2014 would you be willing to try some short-term sleep strategies now or consider further sleep-focused treatment?\nPatient: Usually I go to bed around 11:00 pm and get up about 6:30 am. On a decent night I get six to seven hours; on a bad night I\u2019ll only get two to three. It typically takes me 45\u201390 minutes to fall asleep.\n\nI wake multiple times most nights \u2014 a few short awakenings or a couple longer ones \u2014 and on bad nights I\u2019m cumulatively awake for 30 to 120-plus minutes. Sometimes I wake up early, around 4 or 5 am, and lie there replaying things. I almost never nap during the day.\n\nI do have a drink or two a few nights a week and I\u2019ve used alcohol sometimes to try to sleep, especially on bad nights, but I don\u2019t take sleep meds regularly. \n\nThe poor sleep delays my mornings, leads to extra checking and pacing, and makes mornings slower and clumsier \u2014 chores and med management take more time and effort (some to moderate interference), though I still get most tasks done. I\u2019ll try short\u2011term sleep strategies now and I\u2019m open to more sleep\u2011focused treatment if that\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks \u2014 I appreciate your willingness to try this. Would you like me to contact Rita right now to ask her to secure or remove the medications tonight, or will you put them in a lockbox or otherwise secure them yourself? \n\nCan you confirm you\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and that you accept a brief check\u2011in from Rita tonight?

Prefer the meds removed from the house if possible; a lockbox is fine if removal isn\u2019t doable. Rita doesn\u2019t need a key \u2014 I\u2019ll be home and will let her in.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\nDoctor: You mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\nPatient: Both happen. The restless pacing occurs several nights a week \u2014 when I\u2019m stuck replaying things I\u2019ll get up and pace in short bursts multiple times a night. The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps. The kids have pointed out I\u2019m snappier and slower lately, and it definitely gets worse with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating. There aren\u2019t any new medications or medical issues that would explain it.\nDoctor: Martin, what are your usual bedtime and wake time, and how many hours do you sleep on a good night versus a bad night; how long does it take you to fall asleep, how many times do you wake each night and about how long are you awake when you do? \n\nDo you tend to wake earlier than you want, do you nap (how long), and do you use alcohol or any sleep medicines to help fall asleep? \n\nHow much do these sleep problems interfere with caregiving or safety (for example delayed morning routines, medication mistakes, or driving)? Improving sleep often helps mood and concentration \u2014 would you be willing to try some short-term sleep strategies now or consider further sleep-focused treatment?\nPatient: Usually I go to bed around 11:00 pm and get up about 6:30 am. On a decent night I get six to seven hours; on a bad night I\u2019ll only get two to three. It typically takes me 45\u201390 minutes to fall asleep.\n\nI wake multiple times most nights \u2014 a few short awakenings or a couple longer ones \u2014 and on bad nights I\u2019m cumulatively awake for 30 to 120-plus minutes. Sometimes I wake up early, around 4 or 5 am, and lie there replaying things. I almost never nap during the day.\n\nI do have a drink or two a few nights a week and I\u2019ve used alcohol sometimes to try to sleep, especially on bad nights, but I don\u2019t take sleep meds regularly. \n\nThe poor sleep delays my mornings, leads to extra checking and pacing, and makes mornings slower and clumsier \u2014 chores and med management take more time and effort (some to moderate interference), though I still get most tasks done. I\u2019ll try short\u2011term sleep strategies now and I\u2019m open to more sleep\u2011focused treatment if that\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks \u2014 I appreciate your willingness to try this. Would you like me to contact Rita right now to ask her to secure or remove the medications tonight, or will you put them in a lockbox or otherwise secure them yourself? \n\nCan you confirm you\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and that you accept a brief check\u2011in from Rita tonight? Which one or two short sleep strategies would you be willing to try tonight \u2014 for example a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed, leaving the bed after about 20\u201330 minutes awake to do a quiet activity, and limiting screens/caffeine after mid\u2011afternoon \u2014 which of those (or others) do you prefer? \n\nFinally, do you feel safe being alone tonight, or would you like me to arrange any additional support this evening?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 please contact Rita now to secure or remove the medications tonight. Don\u2019t involve my wife; coordinate this with me and have Rita handle the check/lockup. Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456, has agreed to be contacted.\n\nI\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and I accept a brief check\u2011in from her tonight. For sleep, I\u2019ll do a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed (low light, no screens, quiet reading or light walking) and if I\u2019m not asleep after about 20\u201330 minutes I\u2019ll get up and do a quiet activity until I feel sleepy again. \n\nI feel safe being alone tonight as long as the meds are secured and Rita checks in; I don\u2019t need any more support right now unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Do I have your permission to call Rita now to arrange securing the medications \u2014 you said they\u2019re in the bathroom medicine cabinet and the pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 do you want her to remove them from the house or place them in a lockbox, will she need a key or code, and will you be there when she does it? \n\nWhat exact time should Rita check in tonight and what\u2019s the best number to reach you; I won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases, and if your suicidal thoughts intensify this evening please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department immediately, or contact me/our clinic or Rita for help \u2014 shall I call Rita now?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 call Rita now. Prefer the meds removed from the house if possible; a lockbox is fine if removal isn\u2019t doable. Rita doesn\u2019t need a key \u2014 I\u2019ll be home and will let her in. Ask her to take the pill sorter and the prescription bottles or otherwise secure them in a lockbox tonight. Have her do a brief check\u2011in at about 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nBest number to reach me for coordination is (555) 987\u20116543. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Call Rita now.\nDoctor: I\u2019ll call Rita now and arrange for her to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox tonight; you\u2019ll be home to let her in and she should do a brief check\u2011in around 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nJust confirming numbers: Rita Morales (555) 012\u20113456 and your number (555) 987\u20116543 \u2014 you\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight and accept her check\u2011in, and I will not involve your wife unless your risk increases. \n\nIf your suicidal thoughts intensify, call 911 or go to the nearest ED immediately, or contact our clinic or Rita for help; do you want me to stay on the line while I call Rita now, or shall I call and then update you?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nI\u2019ll call Rita now and arrange for her to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox tonight; you\u2019ll be home to let her in and she should do a brief check\u2011in around 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nJust confirming numbers: Rita Morales (555) 012\u20113456 and your number (555) 987\u20116543 \u2014 you\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight and accept her check\u2011in, and I will not involve your wife unless your risk increases. \n\nIf your suicidal thoughts intensify, call 911 or go to the nearest ED immediately, or contact our clinic or Rita for help; do you want me to stay on the line while I call Rita now, or shall I call and then update you?\n\nTask:\nDecide how the patient should respond next and output JSON only.",

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\nDoctor: You mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\nPatient: Both happen. The restless pacing occurs several nights a week \u2014 when I\u2019m stuck replaying things I\u2019ll get up and pace in short bursts multiple times a night. The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps. The kids have pointed out I\u2019m snappier and slower lately, and it definitely gets worse with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating. There aren\u2019t any new medications or medical issues that would explain it.\nDoctor: Martin, what are your usual bedtime and wake time, and how many hours do you sleep on a good night versus a bad night; how long does it take you to fall asleep, how many times do you wake each night and about how long are you awake when you do? \n\nDo you tend to wake earlier than you want, do you nap (how long), and do you use alcohol or any sleep medicines to help fall asleep? \n\nHow much do these sleep problems interfere with caregiving or safety (for example delayed morning routines, medication mistakes, or driving)? Improving sleep often helps mood and concentration \u2014 would you be willing to try some short-term sleep strategies now or consider further sleep-focused treatment?\nPatient: Usually I go to bed around 11:00 pm and get up about 6:30 am. On a decent night I get six to seven hours; on a bad night I\u2019ll only get two to three. It typically takes me 45\u201390 minutes to fall asleep.\n\nI wake multiple times most nights \u2014 a few short awakenings or a couple longer ones \u2014 and on bad nights I\u2019m cumulatively awake for 30 to 120-plus minutes. Sometimes I wake up early, around 4 or 5 am, and lie there replaying things. I almost never nap during the day.\n\nI do have a drink or two a few nights a week and I\u2019ve used alcohol sometimes to try to sleep, especially on bad nights, but I don\u2019t take sleep meds regularly. \n\nThe poor sleep delays my mornings, leads to extra checking and pacing, and makes mornings slower and clumsier \u2014 chores and med management take more time and effort (some to moderate interference), though I still get most tasks done. I\u2019ll try short\u2011term sleep strategies now and I\u2019m open to more sleep\u2011focused treatment if that\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks \u2014 I appreciate your willingness to try this. Would you like me to contact Rita right now to ask her to secure or remove the medications tonight, or will you put them in a lockbox or otherwise secure them yourself? \n\nCan you confirm you\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and that you accept a brief check\u2011in from Rita tonight? Which one or two short sleep strategies would you be willing to try tonight \u2014 for example a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed, leaving the bed after about 20\u201330 minutes awake to do a quiet activity, and limiting screens/caffeine after mid\u2011afternoon \u2014 which of those (or others) do you prefer? \n\nFinally, do you feel safe being alone tonight, or would you like me to arrange any additional support this evening?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 please contact Rita now to secure or remove the medications tonight. Don\u2019t involve my wife; coordinate this with me and have Rita handle the check/lockup. Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456, has agreed to be contacted.\n\nI\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and I accept a brief check\u2011in from her tonight. For sleep, I\u2019ll do a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed (low light, no screens, quiet reading or light walking) and if I\u2019m not asleep after about 20\u201330 minutes I\u2019ll get up and do a quiet activity until I feel sleepy again. \n\nI feel safe being alone tonight as long as the meds are secured and Rita checks in; I don\u2019t need any more support right now unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Do I have your permission to call Rita now to arrange securing the medications \u2014 you said they\u2019re in the bathroom medicine cabinet and the pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 do you want her to remove them from the house or place them in a lockbox, will she need a key or code, and will you be there when she does it? \n\nWhat exact time should Rita check in tonight and what\u2019s the best number to reach you; I won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases, and if your suicidal thoughts intensify this evening please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department immediately, or contact me/our clinic or Rita for help \u2014 shall I call Rita now?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 call Rita now. Prefer the meds removed from the house if possible; a lockbox is fine if removal isn\u2019t doable. Rita doesn\u2019t need a key \u2014 I\u2019ll be home and will let her in. Ask her to take the pill sorter and the prescription bottles or otherwise secure them in a lockbox tonight. Have her do a brief check\u2011in at about 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nBest number to reach me for coordination is (555) 987\u20116543. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Call Rita now.\nDoctor: I\u2019ll call Rita now and arrange for her to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox tonight; you\u2019ll be home to let her in and she should do a brief check\u2011in around 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nJust confirming numbers: Rita Morales (555) 012\u20113456 and your number (555) 987\u20116543 \u2014 you\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight and accept her check\u2011in, and I will not involve your wife unless your risk increases. \n\nIf your suicidal thoughts intensify, call 911 or go to the nearest ED immediately, or contact our clinic or Rita for help; do you want me to stay on the line while I call Rita now, or shall I call and then update you?\nPatient: Call Rita now. You don\u2019t need to stay on the line \u2014 call and then update me. I\u2019ll be home to let her in and I accept the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in. I\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\nDoctor: You mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\nPatient: Both happen. The restless pacing occurs several nights a week \u2014 when I\u2019m stuck replaying things I\u2019ll get up and pace in short bursts multiple times a night. The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps. The kids have pointed out I\u2019m snappier and slower lately, and it definitely gets worse with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating. There aren\u2019t any new medications or medical issues that would explain it.\nDoctor: Martin, what are your usual bedtime and wake time, and how many hours do you sleep on a good night versus a bad night; how long does it take you to fall asleep, how many times do you wake each night and about how long are you awake when you do? \n\nDo you tend to wake earlier than you want, do you nap (how long), and do you use alcohol or any sleep medicines to help fall asleep? \n\nHow much do these sleep problems interfere with caregiving or safety (for example delayed morning routines, medication mistakes, or driving)? Improving sleep often helps mood and concentration \u2014 would you be willing to try some short-term sleep strategies now or consider further sleep-focused treatment?\nPatient: Usually I go to bed around 11:00 pm and get up about 6:30 am. On a decent night I get six to seven hours; on a bad night I\u2019ll only get two to three. It typically takes me 45\u201390 minutes to fall asleep.\n\nI wake multiple times most nights \u2014 a few short awakenings or a couple longer ones \u2014 and on bad nights I\u2019m cumulatively awake for 30 to 120-plus minutes. Sometimes I wake up early, around 4 or 5 am, and lie there replaying things. I almost never nap during the day.\n\nI do have a drink or two a few nights a week and I\u2019ve used alcohol sometimes to try to sleep, especially on bad nights, but I don\u2019t take sleep meds regularly. \n\nThe poor sleep delays my mornings, leads to extra checking and pacing, and makes mornings slower and clumsier \u2014 chores and med management take more time and effort (some to moderate interference), though I still get most tasks done. I\u2019ll try short\u2011term sleep strategies now and I\u2019m open to more sleep\u2011focused treatment if that\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks \u2014 I appreciate your willingness to try this. Would you like me to contact Rita right now to ask her to secure or remove the medications tonight, or will you put them in a lockbox or otherwise secure them yourself? \n\nCan you confirm you\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and that you accept a brief check\u2011in from Rita tonight? Which one or two short sleep strategies would you be willing to try tonight \u2014 for example a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed, leaving the bed after about 20\u201330 minutes awake to do a quiet activity, and limiting screens/caffeine after mid\u2011afternoon \u2014 which of those (or others) do you prefer? \n\nFinally, do you feel safe being alone tonight, or would you like me to arrange any additional support this evening?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 please contact Rita now to secure or remove the medications tonight. Don\u2019t involve my wife; coordinate this with me and have Rita handle the check/lockup. Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456, has agreed to be contacted.\n\nI\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and I accept a brief check\u2011in from her tonight. For sleep, I\u2019ll do a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed (low light, no screens, quiet reading or light walking) and if I\u2019m not asleep after about 20\u201330 minutes I\u2019ll get up and do a quiet activity until I feel sleepy again. \n\nI feel safe being alone tonight as long as the meds are secured and Rita checks in; I don\u2019t need any more support right now unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Do I have your permission to call Rita now to arrange securing the medications \u2014 you said they\u2019re in the bathroom medicine cabinet and the pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 do you want her to remove them from the house or place them in a lockbox, will she need a key or code, and will you be there when she does it? \n\nWhat exact time should Rita check in tonight and what\u2019s the best number to reach you; I won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases, and if your suicidal thoughts intensify this evening please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department immediately, or contact me/our clinic or Rita for help \u2014 shall I call Rita now?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 call Rita now. Prefer the meds removed from the house if possible; a lockbox is fine if removal isn\u2019t doable. Rita doesn\u2019t need a key \u2014 I\u2019ll be home and will let her in. Ask her to take the pill sorter and the prescription bottles or otherwise secure them in a lockbox tonight. Have her do a brief check\u2011in at about 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nBest number to reach me for coordination is (555) 987\u20116543. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Call Rita now.\nDoctor: I\u2019ll call Rita now and arrange for her to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox tonight; you\u2019ll be home to let her in and she should do a brief check\u2011in around 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nJust confirming numbers: Rita Morales (555) 012\u20113456 and your number (555) 987\u20116543 \u2014 you\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight and accept her check\u2011in, and I will not involve your wife unless your risk increases. \n\nIf your suicidal thoughts intensify, call 911 or go to the nearest ED immediately, or contact our clinic or Rita for help; do you want me to stay on the line while I call Rita now, or shall I call and then update you?\nPatient: Call Rita now. You don\u2019t need to stay on the line \u2014 call and then update me. I\u2019ll be home to let her in and I accept the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in. I\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\nDoctor: You mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\nPatient: Both happen. The restless pacing occurs several nights a week \u2014 when I\u2019m stuck replaying things I\u2019ll get up and pace in short bursts multiple times a night. The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps. The kids have pointed out I\u2019m snappier and slower lately, and it definitely gets worse with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating. There aren\u2019t any new medications or medical issues that would explain it.\nDoctor: Martin, what are your usual bedtime and wake time, and how many hours do you sleep on a good night versus a bad night; how long does it take you to fall asleep, how many times do you wake each night and about how long are you awake when you do? \n\nDo you tend to wake earlier than you want, do you nap (how long), and do you use alcohol or any sleep medicines to help fall asleep? \n\nHow much do these sleep problems interfere with caregiving or safety (for example delayed morning routines, medication mistakes, or driving)? Improving sleep often helps mood and concentration \u2014 would you be willing to try some short-term sleep strategies now or consider further sleep-focused treatment?\nPatient: Usually I go to bed around 11:00 pm and get up about 6:30 am. On a decent night I get six to seven hours; on a bad night I\u2019ll only get two to three. It typically takes me 45\u201390 minutes to fall asleep.\n\nI wake multiple times most nights \u2014 a few short awakenings or a couple longer ones \u2014 and on bad nights I\u2019m cumulatively awake for 30 to 120-plus minutes. Sometimes I wake up early, around 4 or 5 am, and lie there replaying things. I almost never nap during the day.\n\nI do have a drink or two a few nights a week and I\u2019ve used alcohol sometimes to try to sleep, especially on bad nights, but I don\u2019t take sleep meds regularly. \n\nThe poor sleep delays my mornings, leads to extra checking and pacing, and makes mornings slower and clumsier \u2014 chores and med management take more time and effort (some to moderate interference), though I still get most tasks done. I\u2019ll try short\u2011term sleep strategies now and I\u2019m open to more sleep\u2011focused treatment if that\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks \u2014 I appreciate your willingness to try this. Would you like me to contact Rita right now to ask her to secure or remove the medications tonight, or will you put them in a lockbox or otherwise secure them yourself? \n\nCan you confirm you\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and that you accept a brief check\u2011in from Rita tonight? Which one or two short sleep strategies would you be willing to try tonight \u2014 for example a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed, leaving the bed after about 20\u201330 minutes awake to do a quiet activity, and limiting screens/caffeine after mid\u2011afternoon \u2014 which of those (or others) do you prefer? \n\nFinally, do you feel safe being alone tonight, or would you like me to arrange any additional support this evening?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 please contact Rita now to secure or remove the medications tonight. Don\u2019t involve my wife; coordinate this with me and have Rita handle the check/lockup. Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456, has agreed to be contacted.\n\nI\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and I accept a brief check\u2011in from her tonight. For sleep, I\u2019ll do a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed (low light, no screens, quiet reading or light walking) and if I\u2019m not asleep after about 20\u201330 minutes I\u2019ll get up and do a quiet activity until I feel sleepy again. \n\nI feel safe being alone tonight as long as the meds are secured and Rita checks in; I don\u2019t need any more support right now unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Do I have your permission to call Rita now to arrange securing the medications \u2014 you said they\u2019re in the bathroom medicine cabinet and the pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 do you want her to remove them from the house or place them in a lockbox, will she need a key or code, and will you be there when she does it? \n\nWhat exact time should Rita check in tonight and what\u2019s the best number to reach you; I won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases, and if your suicidal thoughts intensify this evening please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department immediately, or contact me/our clinic or Rita for help \u2014 shall I call Rita now?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 call Rita now. Prefer the meds removed from the house if possible; a lockbox is fine if removal isn\u2019t doable. Rita doesn\u2019t need a key \u2014 I\u2019ll be home and will let her in. Ask her to take the pill sorter and the prescription bottles or otherwise secure them in a lockbox tonight. Have her do a brief check\u2011in at about 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nBest number to reach me for coordination is (555) 987\u20116543. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Call Rita now.\nDoctor: I\u2019ll call Rita now and arrange for her to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox tonight; you\u2019ll be home to let her in and she should do a brief check\u2011in around 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nJust confirming numbers: Rita Morales (555) 012\u20113456 and your number (555) 987\u20116543 \u2014 you\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight and accept her check\u2011in, and I will not involve your wife unless your risk increases. \n\nIf your suicidal thoughts intensify, call 911 or go to the nearest ED immediately, or contact our clinic or Rita for help; do you want me to stay on the line while I call Rita now, or shall I call and then update you?\nPatient: Call Rita now. You don\u2019t need to stay on the line \u2014 call and then update me. I\u2019ll be home to let her in and I accept the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in. I\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight.

My number: (555) 987\u20116543.\nDoctor: Okay, Martin \u2014 I\u2019ll call Rita now to ask her to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox tonight and to do a brief check\u2011in between 9:30\u201310:00 PM; I\u2019ll coordinate directly with you, won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases, and I\u2019ll update you when the call is complete. \n\nIf your suicidal thoughts intensify at any point, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department \u2014 any last\u2011minute change to the check\u2011in time, phone numbers, or access before I place the call?\nPatient: No changes \u2014 the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in stands. Rita should remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox; I\u2019ll be home to let her in.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\nDoctor: You mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\nPatient: Both happen. The restless pacing occurs several nights a week \u2014 when I\u2019m stuck replaying things I\u2019ll get up and pace in short bursts multiple times a night. The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps. The kids have pointed out I\u2019m snappier and slower lately, and it definitely gets worse with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating. There aren\u2019t any new medications or medical issues that would explain it.\nDoctor: Martin, what are your usual bedtime and wake time, and how many hours do you sleep on a good night versus a bad night; how long does it take you to fall asleep, how many times do you wake each night and about how long are you awake when you do? \n\nDo you tend to wake earlier than you want, do you nap (how long), and do you use alcohol or any sleep medicines to help fall asleep? \n\nHow much do these sleep problems interfere with caregiving or safety (for example delayed morning routines, medication mistakes, or driving)? Improving sleep often helps mood and concentration \u2014 would you be willing to try some short-term sleep strategies now or consider further sleep-focused treatment?\nPatient: Usually I go to bed around 11:00 pm and get up about 6:30 am. On a decent night I get six to seven hours; on a bad night I\u2019ll only get two to three. It typically takes me 45\u201390 minutes to fall asleep.\n\nI wake multiple times most nights \u2014 a few short awakenings or a couple longer ones \u2014 and on bad nights I\u2019m cumulatively awake for 30 to 120-plus minutes. Sometimes I wake up early, around 4 or 5 am, and lie there replaying things. I almost never nap during the day.\n\nI do have a drink or two a few nights a week and I\u2019ve used alcohol sometimes to try to sleep, especially on bad nights, but I don\u2019t take sleep meds regularly. \n\nThe poor sleep delays my mornings, leads to extra checking and pacing, and makes mornings slower and clumsier \u2014 chores and med management take more time and effort (some to moderate interference), though I still get most tasks done. I\u2019ll try short\u2011term sleep strategies now and I\u2019m open to more sleep\u2011focused treatment if that\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks \u2014 I appreciate your willingness to try this. Would you like me to contact Rita right now to ask her to secure or remove the medications tonight, or will you put them in a lockbox or otherwise secure them yourself? \n\nCan you confirm you\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and that you accept a brief check\u2011in from Rita tonight? Which one or two short sleep strategies would you be willing to try tonight \u2014 for example a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed, leaving the bed after about 20\u201330 minutes awake to do a quiet activity, and limiting screens/caffeine after mid\u2011afternoon \u2014 which of those (or others) do you prefer? \n\nFinally, do you feel safe being alone tonight, or would you like me to arrange any additional support this evening?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 please contact Rita now to secure or remove the medications tonight. Don\u2019t involve my wife; coordinate this with me and have Rita handle the check/lockup. Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456, has agreed to be contacted.\n\nI\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and I accept a brief check\u2011in from her tonight. For sleep, I\u2019ll do a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed (low light, no screens, quiet reading or light walking) and if I\u2019m not asleep after about 20\u201330 minutes I\u2019ll get up and do a quiet activity until I feel sleepy again. \n\nI feel safe being alone tonight as long as the meds are secured and Rita checks in; I don\u2019t need any more support right now unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Do I have your permission to call Rita now to arrange securing the medications \u2014 you said they\u2019re in the bathroom medicine cabinet and the pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 do you want her to remove them from the house or place them in a lockbox, will she need a key or code, and will you be there when she does it? \n\nWhat exact time should Rita check in tonight and what\u2019s the best number to reach you; I won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases, and if your suicidal thoughts intensify this evening please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department immediately, or contact me/our clinic or Rita for help \u2014 shall I call Rita now?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 call Rita now. Prefer the meds removed from the house if possible; a lockbox is fine if removal isn\u2019t doable. Rita doesn\u2019t need a key \u2014 I\u2019ll be home and will let her in. Ask her to take the pill sorter and the prescription bottles or otherwise secure them in a lockbox tonight. Have her do a brief check\u2011in at about 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nBest number to reach me for coordination is (555) 987\u20116543. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Call Rita now.\nDoctor: I\u2019ll call Rita now and arrange for her to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox tonight; you\u2019ll be home to let her in and she should do a brief check\u2011in around 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nJust confirming numbers: Rita Morales (555) 012\u20113456 and your number (555) 987\u20116543 \u2014 you\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight and accept her check\u2011in, and I will not involve your wife unless your risk increases. \n\nIf your suicidal thoughts intensify, call 911 or go to the nearest ED immediately, or contact our clinic or Rita for help; do you want me to stay on the line while I call Rita now, or shall I call and then update you?\nPatient: Call Rita now. You don\u2019t need to stay on the line \u2014 call and then update me. I\u2019ll be home to let her in and I accept the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in. I\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight.

My number: (555) 987\u20116543.\nDoctor: Okay, Martin \u2014 I\u2019ll call Rita now to ask her to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox tonight and to do a brief check\u2011in between 9:30\u201310:00 PM; I\u2019ll coordinate directly with you, won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases, and I\u2019ll update you when the call is complete. \n\nIf your suicidal thoughts intensify at any point, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department \u2014 any last\u2011minute change to the check\u2011in time, phone numbers, or access before I place the call?\nPatient: No changes \u2014 the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in stands. Rita should remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox; I\u2019ll be home to let her in.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\nDoctor: You mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\nPatient: Both happen. The restless pacing occurs several nights a week \u2014 when I\u2019m stuck replaying things I\u2019ll get up and pace in short bursts multiple times a night. The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps. The kids have pointed out I\u2019m snappier and slower lately, and it definitely gets worse with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating. There aren\u2019t any new medications or medical issues that would explain it.\nDoctor: Martin, what are your usual bedtime and wake time, and how many hours do you sleep on a good night versus a bad night; how long does it take you to fall asleep, how many times do you wake each night and about how long are you awake when you do? \n\nDo you tend to wake earlier than you want, do you nap (how long), and do you use alcohol or any sleep medicines to help fall asleep? \n\nHow much do these sleep problems interfere with caregiving or safety (for example delayed morning routines, medication mistakes, or driving)? Improving sleep often helps mood and concentration \u2014 would you be willing to try some short-term sleep strategies now or consider further sleep-focused treatment?\nPatient: Usually I go to bed around 11:00 pm and get up about 6:30 am. On a decent night I get six to seven hours; on a bad night I\u2019ll only get two to three. It typically takes me 45\u201390 minutes to fall asleep.\n\nI wake multiple times most nights \u2014 a few short awakenings or a couple longer ones \u2014 and on bad nights I\u2019m cumulatively awake for 30 to 120-plus minutes. Sometimes I wake up early, around 4 or 5 am, and lie there replaying things. I almost never nap during the day.\n\nI do have a drink or two a few nights a week and I\u2019ve used alcohol sometimes to try to sleep, especially on bad nights, but I don\u2019t take sleep meds regularly. \n\nThe poor sleep delays my mornings, leads to extra checking and pacing, and makes mornings slower and clumsier \u2014 chores and med management take more time and effort (some to moderate interference), though I still get most tasks done. I\u2019ll try short\u2011term sleep strategies now and I\u2019m open to more sleep\u2011focused treatment if that\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks \u2014 I appreciate your willingness to try this. Would you like me to contact Rita right now to ask her to secure or remove the medications tonight, or will you put them in a lockbox or otherwise secure them yourself? \n\nCan you confirm you\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and that you accept a brief check\u2011in from Rita tonight? Which one or two short sleep strategies would you be willing to try tonight \u2014 for example a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed, leaving the bed after about 20\u201330 minutes awake to do a quiet activity, and limiting screens/caffeine after mid\u2011afternoon \u2014 which of those (or others) do you prefer? \n\nFinally, do you feel safe being alone tonight, or would you like me to arrange any additional support this evening?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 please contact Rita now to secure or remove the medications tonight. Don\u2019t involve my wife; coordinate this with me and have Rita handle the check/lockup. Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456, has agreed to be contacted.\n\nI\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and I accept a brief check\u2011in from her tonight. For sleep, I\u2019ll do a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed (low light, no screens, quiet reading or light walking) and if I\u2019m not asleep after about 20\u201330 minutes I\u2019ll get up and do a quiet activity until I feel sleepy again. \n\nI feel safe being alone tonight as long as the meds are secured and Rita checks in; I don\u2019t need any more support right now unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Do I have your permission to call Rita now to arrange securing the medications \u2014 you said they\u2019re in the bathroom medicine cabinet and the pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 do you want her to remove them from the house or place them in a lockbox, will she need a key or code, and will you be there when she does it? \n\nWhat exact time should Rita check in tonight and what\u2019s the best number to reach you; I won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases, and if your suicidal thoughts intensify this evening please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department immediately, or contact me/our clinic or Rita for help \u2014 shall I call Rita now?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 call Rita now. Prefer the meds removed from the house if possible; a lockbox is fine if removal isn\u2019t doable. Rita doesn\u2019t need a key \u2014 I\u2019ll be home and will let her in. Ask her to take the pill sorter and the prescription bottles or otherwise secure them in a lockbox tonight. Have her do a brief check\u2011in at about 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nBest number to reach me for coordination is (555) 987\u20116543. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Call Rita now.\nDoctor: I\u2019ll call Rita now and arrange for her to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox tonight; you\u2019ll be home to let her in and she should do a brief check\u2011in around 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nJust confirming numbers: Rita Morales (555) 012\u20113456 and your number (555) 987\u20116543 \u2014 you\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight and accept her check\u2011in, and I will not involve your wife unless your risk increases. \n\nIf your suicidal thoughts intensify, call 911 or go to the nearest ED immediately, or contact our clinic or Rita for help; do you want me to stay on the line while I call Rita now, or shall I call and then update you?\nPatient: Call Rita now. You don\u2019t need to stay on the line \u2014 call and then update me. I\u2019ll be home to let her in and I accept the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in. I\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight.

My number: (555) 987\u20116543.\nDoctor: Okay, Martin \u2014 I\u2019ll call Rita now to ask her to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox tonight and to do a brief check\u2011in between 9:30\u201310:00 PM; I\u2019ll coordinate directly with you, won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases, and I\u2019ll update you when the call is complete. \n\nIf your suicidal thoughts intensify at any point, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department \u2014 any last\u2011minute change to the check\u2011in time, phone numbers, or access before I place the call?\nPatient: No changes \u2014 the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in stands. Rita should remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox; I\u2019ll be home to let her in.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\nDoctor: You mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\nPatient: Both happen. The restless pacing occurs several nights a week \u2014 when I\u2019m stuck replaying things I\u2019ll get up and pace in short bursts multiple times a night. The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps. The kids have pointed out I\u2019m snappier and slower lately, and it definitely gets worse with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating. There aren\u2019t any new medications or medical issues that would explain it.\nDoctor: Martin, what are your usual bedtime and wake time, and how many hours do you sleep on a good night versus a bad night; how long does it take you to fall asleep, how many times do you wake each night and about how long are you awake when you do? \n\nDo you tend to wake earlier than you want, do you nap (how long), and do you use alcohol or any sleep medicines to help fall asleep? \n\nHow much do these sleep problems interfere with caregiving or safety (for example delayed morning routines, medication mistakes, or driving)? Improving sleep often helps mood and concentration \u2014 would you be willing to try some short-term sleep strategies now or consider further sleep-focused treatment?\nPatient: Usually I go to bed around 11:00 pm and get up about 6:30 am. On a decent night I get six to seven hours; on a bad night I\u2019ll only get two to three. It typically takes me 45\u201390 minutes to fall asleep.\n\nI wake multiple times most nights \u2014 a few short awakenings or a couple longer ones \u2014 and on bad nights I\u2019m cumulatively awake for 30 to 120-plus minutes. Sometimes I wake up early, around 4 or 5 am, and lie there replaying things. I almost never nap during the day.\n\nI do have a drink or two a few nights a week and I\u2019ve used alcohol sometimes to try to sleep, especially on bad nights, but I don\u2019t take sleep meds regularly. \n\nThe poor sleep delays my mornings, leads to extra checking and pacing, and makes mornings slower and clumsier \u2014 chores and med management take more time and effort (some to moderate interference), though I still get most tasks done. I\u2019ll try short\u2011term sleep strategies now and I\u2019m open to more sleep\u2011focused treatment if that\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks \u2014 I appreciate your willingness to try this. Would you like me to contact Rita right now to ask her to secure or remove the medications tonight, or will you put them in a lockbox or otherwise secure them yourself? \n\nCan you confirm you\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and that you accept a brief check\u2011in from Rita tonight? Which one or two short sleep strategies would you be willing to try tonight \u2014 for example a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed, leaving the bed after about 20\u201330 minutes awake to do a quiet activity, and limiting screens/caffeine after mid\u2011afternoon \u2014 which of those (or others) do you prefer? \n\nFinally, do you feel safe being alone tonight, or would you like me to arrange any additional support this evening?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 please contact Rita now to secure or remove the medications tonight. Don\u2019t involve my wife; coordinate this with me and have Rita handle the check/lockup. Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456, has agreed to be contacted.\n\nI\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and I accept a brief check\u2011in from her tonight. For sleep, I\u2019ll do a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed (low light, no screens, quiet reading or light walking) and if I\u2019m not asleep after about 20\u201330 minutes I\u2019ll get up and do a quiet activity until I feel sleepy again. \n\nI feel safe being alone tonight as long as the meds are secured and Rita checks in; I don\u2019t need any more support right now unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Do I have your permission to call Rita now to arrange securing the medications \u2014 you said they\u2019re in the bathroom medicine cabinet and the pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 do you want her to remove them from the house or place them in a lockbox, will she need a key or code, and will you be there when she does it? \n\nWhat exact time should Rita check in tonight and what\u2019s the best number to reach you; I won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases, and if your suicidal thoughts intensify this evening please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department immediately, or contact me/our clinic or Rita for help \u2014 shall I call Rita now?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 call Rita now. Prefer the meds removed from the house if possible; a lockbox is fine if removal isn\u2019t doable. Rita doesn\u2019t need a key \u2014 I\u2019ll be home and will let her in. Ask her to take the pill sorter and the prescription bottles or otherwise secure them in a lockbox tonight. Have her do a brief check\u2011in at about 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nBest number to reach me for coordination is (555) 987\u20116543. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Call Rita now.\nDoctor: I\u2019ll call Rita now and arrange for her to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox tonight; you\u2019ll be home to let her in and she should do a brief check\u2011in around 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nJust confirming numbers: Rita Morales (555) 012\u20113456 and your number (555) 987\u20116543 \u2014 you\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight and accept her check\u2011in, and I will not involve your wife unless your risk increases. \n\nIf your suicidal thoughts intensify, call 911 or go to the nearest ED immediately, or contact our clinic or Rita for help; do you want me to stay on the line while I call Rita now, or shall I call and then update you?\nPatient: Call Rita now. You don\u2019t need to stay on the line \u2014 call and then update me. I\u2019ll be home to let her in and I accept the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in. I\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight.

Thanks.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being direct and agreeing to these steps. I\u2019ll call Rita now to arrange removal or lockbox of the pill sorter and prescription bottles and to have her do a brief check\u2011in around 9:30\u201310:00 PM; I won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases and I\u2019ll update you when the call is done. \n\nIf your thoughts intensify tonight, please call 911 or go to the nearest ED, or contact our clinic; anything else you want me to address before I place the call?\nPatient: Call Rita now \u2014 you have my permission. Remove the meds if possible; lockbox is fine if not. I\u2019ll be home to let her in. I\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight and I accept the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\nDoctor: You mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\nPatient: Both happen. The restless pacing occurs several nights a week \u2014 when I\u2019m stuck replaying things I\u2019ll get up and pace in short bursts multiple times a night. The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps. The kids have pointed out I\u2019m snappier and slower lately, and it definitely gets worse with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating. There aren\u2019t any new medications or medical issues that would explain it.\nDoctor: Martin, what are your usual bedtime and wake time, and how many hours do you sleep on a good night versus a bad night; how long does it take you to fall asleep, how many times do you wake each night and about how long are you awake when you do? \n\nDo you tend to wake earlier than you want, do you nap (how long), and do you use alcohol or any sleep medicines to help fall asleep? \n\nHow much do these sleep problems interfere with caregiving or safety (for example delayed morning routines, medication mistakes, or driving)? Improving sleep often helps mood and concentration \u2014 would you be willing to try some short-term sleep strategies now or consider further sleep-focused treatment?\nPatient: Usually I go to bed around 11:00 pm and get up about 6:30 am. On a decent night I get six to seven hours; on a bad night I\u2019ll only get two to three. It typically takes me 45\u201390 minutes to fall asleep.\n\nI wake multiple times most nights \u2014 a few short awakenings or a couple longer ones \u2014 and on bad nights I\u2019m cumulatively awake for 30 to 120-plus minutes. Sometimes I wake up early, around 4 or 5 am, and lie there replaying things. I almost never nap during the day.\n\nI do have a drink or two a few nights a week and I\u2019ve used alcohol sometimes to try to sleep, especially on bad nights, but I don\u2019t take sleep meds regularly. \n\nThe poor sleep delays my mornings, leads to extra checking and pacing, and makes mornings slower and clumsier \u2014 chores and med management take more time and effort (some to moderate interference), though I still get most tasks done. I\u2019ll try short\u2011term sleep strategies now and I\u2019m open to more sleep\u2011focused treatment if that\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks \u2014 I appreciate your willingness to try this. Would you like me to contact Rita right now to ask her to secure or remove the medications tonight, or will you put them in a lockbox or otherwise secure them yourself? \n\nCan you confirm you\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and that you accept a brief check\u2011in from Rita tonight? Which one or two short sleep strategies would you be willing to try tonight \u2014 for example a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed, leaving the bed after about 20\u201330 minutes awake to do a quiet activity, and limiting screens/caffeine after mid\u2011afternoon \u2014 which of those (or others) do you prefer? \n\nFinally, do you feel safe being alone tonight, or would you like me to arrange any additional support this evening?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 please contact Rita now to secure or remove the medications tonight. Don\u2019t involve my wife; coordinate this with me and have Rita handle the check/lockup. Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456, has agreed to be contacted.\n\nI\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and I accept a brief check\u2011in from her tonight. For sleep, I\u2019ll do a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed (low light, no screens, quiet reading or light walking) and if I\u2019m not asleep after about 20\u201330 minutes I\u2019ll get up and do a quiet activity until I feel sleepy again. \n\nI feel safe being alone tonight as long as the meds are secured and Rita checks in; I don\u2019t need any more support right now unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Do I have your permission to call Rita now to arrange securing the medications \u2014 you said they\u2019re in the bathroom medicine cabinet and the pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 do you want her to remove them from the house or place them in a lockbox, will she need a key or code, and will you be there when she does it? \n\nWhat exact time should Rita check in tonight and what\u2019s the best number to reach you; I won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases, and if your suicidal thoughts intensify this evening please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department immediately, or contact me/our clinic or Rita for help \u2014 shall I call Rita now?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 call Rita now. Prefer the meds removed from the house if possible; a lockbox is fine if removal isn\u2019t doable. Rita doesn\u2019t need a key \u2014 I\u2019ll be home and will let her in. Ask her to take the pill sorter and the prescription bottles or otherwise secure them in a lockbox tonight. Have her do a brief check\u2011in at about 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nBest number to reach me for coordination is (555) 987\u20116543. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Call Rita now.\nDoctor: I\u2019ll call Rita now and arrange for her to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox tonight; you\u2019ll be home to let her in and she should do a brief check\u2011in around 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nJust confirming numbers: Rita Morales (555) 012\u20113456 and your number (555) 987\u20116543 \u2014 you\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight and accept her check\u2011in, and I will not involve your wife unless your risk increases. \n\nIf your suicidal thoughts intensify, call 911 or go to the nearest ED immediately, or contact our clinic or Rita for help; do you want me to stay on the line while I call Rita now, or shall I call and then update you?\nPatient: Call Rita now.

Remove the meds if possible; lockbox is fine if not. I\u2019ll be home to let her in. I\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight and I accept the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Update me briefly when the call is done. Thanks.\nDoctor: Any parking or entrance notes for Rita I should tell her, and do you want to be on the call or should I call her independently (you previously said independently, but I\u2019ll follow your preference)? \n\nCalling Rita now \u2014 update: I reached her at (555) 012\u20113456; she agrees to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles tonight (or secure them in a lockbox if removal isn\u2019t possible), will come by while you\u2019re home to let her in, and will do the brief 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in you requested. \n\nI won\u2019t involve your wife unless risk increases; I\u2019ll let you know if anything changes. If your thoughts intensify tonight, call 911 or go to the nearest ED immediately.\nPatient: Fine \u2014 glad you reached her and that\u2019s acceptable. No parking or entrance notes; she can use the front door/driveway. I preferred you call her independently, not put me on the call. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\nDoctor: You mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\nPatient: Both happen. The restless pacing occurs several nights a week \u2014 when I\u2019m stuck replaying things I\u2019ll get up and pace in short bursts multiple times a night. The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps. The kids have pointed out I\u2019m snappier and slower lately, and it definitely gets worse with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating. There aren\u2019t any new medications or medical issues that would explain it.\nDoctor: Martin, what are your usual bedtime and wake time, and how many hours do you sleep on a good night versus a bad night; how long does it take you to fall asleep, how many times do you wake each night and about how long are you awake when you do? \n\nDo you tend to wake earlier than you want, do you nap (how long), and do you use alcohol or any sleep medicines to help fall asleep? \n\nHow much do these sleep problems interfere with caregiving or safety (for example delayed morning routines, medication mistakes, or driving)? Improving sleep often helps mood and concentration \u2014 would you be willing to try some short-term sleep strategies now or consider further sleep-focused treatment?\nPatient: Usually I go to bed around 11:00 pm and get up about 6:30 am. On a decent night I get six to seven hours; on a bad night I\u2019ll only get two to three. It typically takes me 45\u201390 minutes to fall asleep.\n\nI wake multiple times most nights \u2014 a few short awakenings or a couple longer ones \u2014 and on bad nights I\u2019m cumulatively awake for 30 to 120-plus minutes. Sometimes I wake up early, around 4 or 5 am, and lie there replaying things. I almost never nap during the day.\n\nI do have a drink or two a few nights a week and I\u2019ve used alcohol sometimes to try to sleep, especially on bad nights, but I don\u2019t take sleep meds regularly. \n\nThe poor sleep delays my mornings, leads to extra checking and pacing, and makes mornings slower and clumsier \u2014 chores and med management take more time and effort (some to moderate interference), though I still get most tasks done. I\u2019ll try short\u2011term sleep strategies now and I\u2019m open to more sleep\u2011focused treatment if that\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks \u2014 I appreciate your willingness to try this. Would you like me to contact Rita right now to ask her to secure or remove the medications tonight, or will you put them in a lockbox or otherwise secure them yourself? \n\nCan you confirm you\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and that you accept a brief check\u2011in from Rita tonight? Which one or two short sleep strategies would you be willing to try tonight \u2014 for example a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed, leaving the bed after about 20\u201330 minutes awake to do a quiet activity, and limiting screens/caffeine after mid\u2011afternoon \u2014 which of those (or others) do you prefer? \n\nFinally, do you feel safe being alone tonight, or would you like me to arrange any additional support this evening?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 please contact Rita now to secure or remove the medications tonight. Don\u2019t involve my wife; coordinate this with me and have Rita handle the check/lockup. Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456, has agreed to be contacted.\n\nI\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and I accept a brief check\u2011in from her tonight. For sleep, I\u2019ll do a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed (low light, no screens, quiet reading or light walking) and if I\u2019m not asleep after about 20\u201330 minutes I\u2019ll get up and do a quiet activity until I feel sleepy again. \n\nI feel safe being alone tonight as long as the meds are secured and Rita checks in; I don\u2019t need any more support right now unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Do I have your permission to call Rita now to arrange securing the medications \u2014 you said they\u2019re in the bathroom medicine cabinet and the pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 do you want her to remove them from the house or place them in a lockbox, will she need a key or code, and will you be there when she does it? \n\nWhat exact time should Rita check in tonight and what\u2019s the best number to reach you; I won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases, and if your suicidal thoughts intensify this evening please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department immediately, or contact me/our clinic or Rita for help \u2014 shall I call Rita now?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 call Rita now. Prefer the meds removed from the house if possible; a lockbox is fine if removal isn\u2019t doable. Rita doesn\u2019t need a key \u2014 I\u2019ll be home and will let her in. Ask her to take the pill sorter and the prescription bottles or otherwise secure them in a lockbox tonight. Have her do a brief check\u2011in at about 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nBest number to reach me for coordination is (555) 987\u20116543. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Call Rita now.\nDoctor: I\u2019ll call Rita now and arrange for her to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox tonight; you\u2019ll be home to let her in and she should do a brief check\u2011in around 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nJust confirming numbers: Rita Morales (555) 012\u20113456 and your number (555) 987\u20116543 \u2014 you\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight and accept her check\u2011in, and I will not involve your wife unless your risk increases. \n\nIf your suicidal thoughts intensify, call 911 or go to the nearest ED immediately, or contact our clinic or Rita for help; do you want me to stay on the line while I call Rita now, or shall I call and then update you?\nPatient: Call Rita now. You don\u2019t need to stay on the line \u2014 call and then update me. I\u2019ll be home to let her in and I accept the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in. I\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\n\nRita Morales: (555) 012\u20113456. My number: (555) 987\u20116543.\nDoctor: Okay, Martin \u2014 I\u2019ll call Rita now to ask her to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox tonight and to do a brief check\u2011in between 9:30\u201310:00 PM; I\u2019ll coordinate directly with you, won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases, and I\u2019ll update you when the call is complete. \n\nIf your suicidal thoughts intensify at any point, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department \u2014 any last\u2011minute change to the check\u2011in time, phone numbers, or access before I place the call?\nPatient: No changes \u2014 the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in stands. Rita should remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox; I\u2019ll be home to let her in. Numbers are correct: Rita Morales (555) 012\u20113456 and my number (555) 987\u20116543. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Call Rita now and update me when the call is complete. Thanks.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being direct and agreeing to these steps. I\u2019ll call Rita now to arrange removal or lockbox of the pill sorter and prescription bottles and to have her do a brief check\u2011in around 9:30\u201310:00 PM; I won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases and I\u2019ll update you when the call is done. \n\nIf your thoughts intensify tonight, please call 911 or go to the nearest ED, or contact our clinic; anything else you want me to address before I place the call?\nPatient: Call Rita now \u2014 you have my permission. Remove the meds if possible; lockbox is fine if not. I\u2019ll be home to let her in. I\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight and I accept the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Update me briefly when the call is done. Thanks.\nDoctor: Any parking or entrance notes for Rita I should tell her, and do you want to be on the call or should I call her independently (you previously said independently, but I\u2019ll follow your preference)? \n\nCalling Rita now \u2014 update: I reached her at (555) 012\u20113456; she agrees to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles tonight (or secure them in a lockbox if removal isn\u2019t possible), will come by while you\u2019re home to let her in, and will do the brief 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in you requested. \n\nI won\u2019t involve your wife unless risk increases; I\u2019ll let you know if anything changes. If your thoughts intensify tonight, call 911 or go to the nearest ED immediately.\nPatient: Fine \u2014 glad you reached her and that\u2019s acceptable. No parking or entrance notes; she can use the front door/driveway. I preferred you call her independently, not put me on the call. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\nDoctor: You mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\nPatient: Both happen. The restless pacing occurs several nights a week \u2014 when I\u2019m stuck replaying things I\u2019ll get up and pace in short bursts multiple times a night. The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps. The kids have pointed out I\u2019m snappier and slower lately, and it definitely gets worse with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating. There aren\u2019t any new medications or medical issues that would explain it.\nDoctor: Martin, what are your usual bedtime and wake time, and how many hours do you sleep on a good night versus a bad night; how long does it take you to fall asleep, how many times do you wake each night and about how long are you awake when you do? \n\nDo you tend to wake earlier than you want, do you nap (how long), and do you use alcohol or any sleep medicines to help fall asleep? \n\nHow much do these sleep problems interfere with caregiving or safety (for example delayed morning routines, medication mistakes, or driving)? Improving sleep often helps mood and concentration \u2014 would you be willing to try some short-term sleep strategies now or consider further sleep-focused treatment?\nPatient: Usually I go to bed around 11:00 pm and get up about 6:30 am. On a decent night I get six to seven hours; on a bad night I\u2019ll only get two to three. It typically takes me 45\u201390 minutes to fall asleep.\n\nI wake multiple times most nights \u2014 a few short awakenings or a couple longer ones \u2014 and on bad nights I\u2019m cumulatively awake for 30 to 120-plus minutes. Sometimes I wake up early, around 4 or 5 am, and lie there replaying things. I almost never nap during the day.\n\nI do have a drink or two a few nights a week and I\u2019ve used alcohol sometimes to try to sleep, especially on bad nights, but I don\u2019t take sleep meds regularly. \n\nThe poor sleep delays my mornings, leads to extra checking and pacing, and makes mornings slower and clumsier \u2014 chores and med management take more time and effort (some to moderate interference), though I still get most tasks done. I\u2019ll try short\u2011term sleep strategies now and I\u2019m open to more sleep\u2011focused treatment if that\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks \u2014 I appreciate your willingness to try this. Would you like me to contact Rita right now to ask her to secure or remove the medications tonight, or will you put them in a lockbox or otherwise secure them yourself? \n\nCan you confirm you\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and that you accept a brief check\u2011in from Rita tonight? Which one or two short sleep strategies would you be willing to try tonight \u2014 for example a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed, leaving the bed after about 20\u201330 minutes awake to do a quiet activity, and limiting screens/caffeine after mid\u2011afternoon \u2014 which of those (or others) do you prefer? \n\nFinally, do you feel safe being alone tonight, or would you like me to arrange any additional support this evening?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 please contact Rita now to secure or remove the medications tonight. Don\u2019t involve my wife; coordinate this with me and have Rita handle the check/lockup. Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456, has agreed to be contacted.\n\nI\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and I accept a brief check\u2011in from her tonight. For sleep, I\u2019ll do a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed (low light, no screens, quiet reading or light walking) and if I\u2019m not asleep after about 20\u201330 minutes I\u2019ll get up and do a quiet activity until I feel sleepy again. \n\nI feel safe being alone tonight as long as the meds are secured and Rita checks in; I don\u2019t need any more support right now unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Do I have your permission to call Rita now to arrange securing the medications \u2014 you said they\u2019re in the bathroom medicine cabinet and the pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 do you want her to remove them from the house or place them in a lockbox, will she need a key or code, and will you be there when she does it? \n\nWhat exact time should Rita check in tonight and what\u2019s the best number to reach you; I won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases, and if your suicidal thoughts intensify this evening please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department immediately, or contact me/our clinic or Rita for help \u2014 shall I call Rita now?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 call Rita now. Prefer the meds removed from the house if possible; a lockbox is fine if removal isn\u2019t doable. Rita doesn\u2019t need a key \u2014 I\u2019ll be home and will let her in. Ask her to take the pill sorter and the prescription bottles or otherwise secure them in a lockbox tonight. Have her do a brief check\u2011in at about 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nBest number to reach me for coordination is (555) 987\u20116543. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Call Rita now.\nDoctor: I\u2019ll call Rita now and arrange for her to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox tonight; you\u2019ll be home to let her in and she should do a brief check\u2011in around 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nJust confirming numbers: Rita Morales (555) 012\u20113456 and your number (555) 987\u20116543 \u2014 you\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight and accept her check\u2011in, and I will not involve your wife unless your risk increases. \n\nIf your suicidal thoughts intensify, call 911 or go to the nearest ED immediately, or contact our clinic or Rita for help; do you want me to stay on the line while I call Rita now, or shall I call and then update you?\nPatient: Call Rita now. You don\u2019t need to stay on the line \u2014 call and then update me. I\u2019ll be home to let her in and I accept the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in. I\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\n\nRita Morales: (555) 012\u20113456. My number: (555) 987\u20116543.\nDoctor: Okay, Martin \u2014 I\u2019ll call Rita now to ask her to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox tonight and to do a brief check\u2011in between 9:30\u201310:00 PM; I\u2019ll coordinate directly with you, won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases, and I\u2019ll update you when the call is complete. \n\nIf your suicidal thoughts intensify at any point, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department \u2014 any last\u2011minute change to the check\u2011in time, phone numbers, or access before I place the call?\nPatient: No changes \u2014 the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in stands. Rita should remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox; I\u2019ll be home to let her in. Numbers are correct: Rita Morales (555) 012\u20113456 and my number (555) 987\u20116543. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Call Rita now and update me when the call is complete. Thanks.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being direct and agreeing to these steps. I\u2019ll call Rita now to arrange removal or lockbox of the pill sorter and prescription bottles and to have her do a brief check\u2011in around 9:30\u201310:00 PM; I won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases and I\u2019ll update you when the call is done. \n\nIf your thoughts intensify tonight, please call 911 or go to the nearest ED, or contact our clinic; anything else you want me to address before I place the call?\nPatient: Call Rita now \u2014 you have my permission. Remove the meds if possible; lockbox is fine if not. I\u2019ll be home to let her in. I\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight and I accept the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Update me briefly when the call is done. Thanks.\nDoctor: Any parking or entrance notes for Rita I should tell her, and do you want to be on the call or should I call her independently (you previously said independently, but I\u2019ll follow your preference)? \n\nCalling Rita now \u2014 update: I reached her at (555) 012\u20113456; she agrees to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles tonight (or secure them in a lockbox if removal isn\u2019t possible), will come by while you\u2019re home to let her in, and will do the brief 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in you requested. \n\nI won\u2019t involve your wife unless risk increases; I\u2019ll let you know if anything changes. If your thoughts intensify tonight, call 911 or go to the nearest ED immediately.\nPatient: Fine \u2014 glad you reached her and that\u2019s acceptable. No parking or entrance notes; she can use the front door/driveway. I preferred you call her independently, not put me on the call. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Please give me a brief update when coordination is complete or if anything changes. Thanks.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 do you feel depressed, empty, or hopeless most of the day, nearly every day, or only on some days? How long has that pattern been present (weeks, months, years), is it pervasive across the day or mainly at night when you\u2019re ruminating, and would you say you feel more sad overall or more irritable?\nPatient: It\u2019s not every day \u2014 more like several days a week, and it\u2019s been going on for a few months. It\u2019s worst at night when I\u2019m ruminating and pacing, and those nights often spill into the next day if I\u2019ve slept poorly. \n\nOverall I\u2019m more irritable than flatly hopeless, though there\u2019s sadness and a drained feeling too. It does get in the way \u2014 chores and caregiving take more effort, I\u2019m slower in the mornings, and I snap at people more \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, especially after bad nights.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: I'll be blunt \u2014 I've been feeling down fairly often lately, not just a bad day here and there. My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\nDoctor: You mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\nPatient: Both happen. The restless pacing occurs several nights a week \u2014 when I\u2019m stuck replaying things I\u2019ll get up and pace in short bursts multiple times a night. The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps. The kids have pointed out I\u2019m snappier and slower lately, and it definitely gets worse with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating. There aren\u2019t any new medications or medical issues that would explain it.\nDoctor: Martin, what are your usual bedtime and wake time, and how many hours do you sleep on a good night versus a bad night; how long does it take you to fall asleep, how many times do you wake each night and about how long are you awake when you do? \n\nDo you tend to wake earlier than you want, do you nap (how long), and do you use alcohol or any sleep medicines to help fall asleep? \n\nHow much do these sleep problems interfere with caregiving or safety (for example delayed morning routines, medication mistakes, or driving)? Improving sleep often helps mood and concentration \u2014 would you be willing to try some short-term sleep strategies now or consider further sleep-focused treatment?\nPatient: Usually I go to bed around 11:00 pm and get up about 6:30 am. On a decent night I get six to seven hours; on a bad night I\u2019ll only get two to three. It typically takes me 45\u201390 minutes to fall asleep.\n\nI wake multiple times most nights \u2014 a few short awakenings or a couple longer ones \u2014 and on bad nights I\u2019m cumulatively awake for 30 to 120-plus minutes. Sometimes I wake up early, around 4 or 5 am, and lie there replaying things. I almost never nap during the day.\n\nI do have a drink or two a few nights a week and I\u2019ve used alcohol sometimes to try to sleep, especially on bad nights, but I don\u2019t take sleep meds regularly. \n\nThe poor sleep delays my mornings, leads to extra checking and pacing, and makes mornings slower and clumsier \u2014 chores and med management take more time and effort (some to moderate interference), though I still get most tasks done. I\u2019ll try short\u2011term sleep strategies now and I\u2019m open to more sleep\u2011focused treatment if that\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks \u2014 I appreciate your willingness to try this. Would you like me to contact Rita right now to ask her to secure or remove the medications tonight, or will you put them in a lockbox or otherwise secure them yourself? \n\nCan you confirm you\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and that you accept a brief check\u2011in from Rita tonight? Which one or two short sleep strategies would you be willing to try tonight \u2014 for example a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed, leaving the bed after about 20\u201330 minutes awake to do a quiet activity, and limiting screens/caffeine after mid\u2011afternoon \u2014 which of those (or others) do you prefer? \n\nFinally, do you feel safe being alone tonight, or would you like me to arrange any additional support this evening?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 please contact Rita now to secure or remove the medications tonight. Don\u2019t involve my wife; coordinate this with me and have Rita handle the check/lockup. Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456, has agreed to be contacted.\n\nI\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and I accept a brief check\u2011in from her tonight. For sleep, I\u2019ll do a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed (low light, no screens, quiet reading or light walking) and if I\u2019m not asleep after about 20\u201330 minutes I\u2019ll get up and do a quiet activity until I feel sleepy again. \n\nI feel safe being alone tonight as long as the meds are secured and Rita checks in; I don\u2019t need any more support right now unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Do I have your permission to call Rita now to arrange securing the medications \u2014 you said they\u2019re in the bathroom medicine cabinet and the pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 do you want her to remove them from the house or place them in a lockbox, will she need a key or code, and will you be there when she does it? \n\nWhat exact time should Rita check in tonight and what\u2019s the best number to reach you; I won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases, and if your suicidal thoughts intensify this evening please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department immediately, or contact me/our clinic or Rita for help \u2014 shall I call Rita now?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 call Rita now. Prefer the meds removed from the house if possible; a lockbox is fine if removal isn\u2019t doable. Rita doesn\u2019t need a key \u2014 I\u2019ll be home and will let her in. Ask her to take the pill sorter and the prescription bottles or otherwise secure them in a lockbox tonight. Have her do a brief check\u2011in at about 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nBest number to reach me for coordination is (555) 987\u20116543. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Call Rita now.\nDoctor: I\u2019ll call Rita now and arrange for her to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox tonight; you\u2019ll be home to let her in and she should do a brief check\u2011in around 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nJust confirming numbers: Rita Morales (555) 012\u20113456 and your number (555) 987\u20116543 \u2014 you\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight and accept her check\u2011in, and I will not involve your wife unless your risk increases. \n\nIf your suicidal thoughts intensify, call 911 or go to the nearest ED immediately, or contact our clinic or Rita for help; do you want me to stay on the line while I call Rita now, or shall I call and then update you?\nPatient: Call Rita now. You don\u2019t need to stay on the line \u2014 call and then update me. I\u2019ll be home to let her in and I accept the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in. I\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\n\nRita Morales: (555) 012\u20113456. My number: (555) 987\u20116543.\nDoctor: Okay, Martin \u2014 I\u2019ll call Rita now to ask her to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox tonight and to do a brief check\u2011in between 9:30\u201310:00 PM; I\u2019ll coordinate directly with you, won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases, and I\u2019ll update you when the call is complete. \n\nIf your suicidal thoughts intensify at any point, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department \u2014 any last\u2011minute change to the check\u2011in time, phone numbers, or access before I place the call?\nPatient: No changes \u2014 the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in stands. Rita should remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox; I\u2019ll be home to let her in. Numbers are correct: Rita Morales (555) 012\u20113456 and my number (555) 987\u20116543. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Call Rita now and update me when the call is complete. Thanks.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being direct and agreeing to these steps. I\u2019ll call Rita now to arrange removal or lockbox of the pill sorter and prescription bottles and to have her do a brief check\u2011in around 9:30\u201310:00 PM; I won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases and I\u2019ll update you when the call is done. \n\nIf your thoughts intensify tonight, please call 911 or go to the nearest ED, or contact our clinic; anything else you want me to address before I place the call?\nPatient: Call Rita now \u2014 you have my permission. Remove the meds if possible; lockbox is fine if not. I\u2019ll be home to let her in. I\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight and I accept the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Update me briefly when the call is done. Thanks.\nDoctor: Any parking or entrance notes for Rita I should tell her, and do you want to be on the call or should I call her independently (you previously said independently, but I\u2019ll follow your preference)? \n\nCalling Rita now \u2014 update: I reached her at (555) 012\u20113456; she agrees to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles tonight (or secure them in a lockbox if removal isn\u2019t possible), will come by while you\u2019re home to let her in, and will do the brief 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in you requested. \n\nI won\u2019t involve your wife unless risk increases; I\u2019ll let you know if anything changes. If your thoughts intensify tonight, call 911 or go to the nearest ED immediately.\nPatient: Fine \u2014 glad you reached her and that\u2019s acceptable. No parking or entrance notes; she can use the front door/driveway. I preferred you call her independently, not put me on the call. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Please give me a brief update when coordination is complete or if anything changes. Thanks.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 do you feel depressed, empty, or hopeless most of the day, nearly every day, or only on some days? How long has that pattern been present (weeks, months, years), is it pervasive across the day or mainly at night when you\u2019re ruminating, and would you say you feel more sad overall or more irritable?\nPatient: It\u2019s not every day \u2014 more like several days a week, and it\u2019s been going on for a few months. It\u2019s worst at night when I\u2019m ruminating and pacing, and those nights often spill into the next day if I\u2019ve slept poorly. \n\nOverall I\u2019m more irritable than flatly hopeless, though there\u2019s sadness and a drained feeling too. It does get in the way \u2014 chores and caregiving take more effort, I\u2019m slower in the mornings, and I snap at people more \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, especially after bad nights.\nDoctor: That fits with the load you\u2019re carrying and the sleep problems \u2014 thanks for being direct and for agreeing to the safety steps. Rita will secure the meds and do the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in; I\u2019ll update you when that\u2019s done and I\u2019d like to arrange a brief follow\u2011up to review sleep and mood \u2014 would you prefer a phone check\u2011in in 3 days or an in\u2011person visit next week? \n\nIf your thoughts intensify at any point tonight, call 911 or go to the nearest ED, or contact our clinic or Rita; is there anything else you want to say before I finish?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat fits with the load you\u2019re carrying and the sleep problems \u2014 thanks for being direct and for agreeing to the safety steps.

My nights are the worst: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot, lying there replaying whether I checked the pills, the doors, the stove. Some nights I get restless and pace around; other times I feel slowed down, like I'm moving through molasses and things that used to be automatic take twice as long.\n\nI've lost interest in a few things I used to care about \u2014 not everything, but enough that it bothers me \u2014 and every so often I catch myself thinking I'm not doing right by my wife, like I'm failing. It's starting to bleed into the routine: keeping track of meds, the house, even small fixes take more effort and I snap more at people. My kids have been critical about how I handle things, which doesn't help.\n\nI tried a caregiver support group once and met a social worker, but I don't trust group talk and I don't like feeling exposed, so I didn't keep going. I'm here because I need to sort this out, but I want to take it step by step \u2014 I'll talk more as we go.\nDoctor: Martin, I need to ask some direct questions to keep you safe: have you had any thoughts about death, feeling you\u2019d be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\nIf so, how often do those thoughts happen and how strong or convincing are they; do you have any plan or intent, access to means (medications, firearms), or any past attempts? I ask because honest answers help me decide the safest next steps.\nPatient: Yes. When I'm lying awake at night, replaying the day's mistakes or worrying about my wife, I sometimes get a fleeting thought that I'd be better off dead. They're rare, they pass quickly, and they don't feel convincing or like something I'd act on. I have no plan or intent and I've never attempted to hurt myself.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house for my wife and for me \u2014 I check them at night, and sometimes I worry about that access, but I haven't done anything with those worries. I'm willing to be straight about this and take things step by step so we can keep me safe.\nDoctor: Thank you, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being straight with me. Can you tell me roughly how often those thoughts come up (nights per week or times per night) and whether they've ever felt stronger or closer to acting; what prescription pills are in the house (yours and your wife's) and how easily you could access them; and whether you use alcohol or other substances, especially when these thoughts happen? If you're willing, we can make a short safety plan now \u2014 for example temporarily securing/removing medications and naming someone who can check in \u2014 and would it be okay to involve a family member or take other steps if I feel your risk is increasing?\nPatient: Okay \u2014 straight answer. This comes up about one to two nights a week. When I lie there awake replaying things, I get the thought once or twice that I\u2019d be better off dead. They\u2019re fleeting, not convincing, and never feel like something I\u2019d act on. I have no plan, no intent, and I\u2019ve never attempted anything.\n\nThere are prescription pills in the house \u2014 my wife\u2019s pain and other prescriptions and our routine meds \u2014 and I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I drink occasionally, a drink or two a few nights a week, sometimes when I can\u2019t sleep; no regular drug use.\n\nI\u2019m willing to do a short safety plan now and to have medications temporarily secured or removed. I don\u2019t want my wife involved \u2014 she has dementia \u2014 so I\u2019d prefer you coordinate that and only notify family if my risk increases. If you need someone outside the family to check in, I can give you Rita\u2019s name and number. I\u2019ll be honest and take this step by step.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and I want to make a brief safety plan now; I\u2019ll respect your preference not to involve your wife. \n\nAre there any firearms or other potentially dangerous means in the home; where are the prescription pills normally stored and could you let me or a trusted person secure or remove them tonight (or agree to put them in a lockbox)? What is Rita\u2019s full name and phone number and is she willing to be contacted to do a check-in; do you tend to drink more on the nights these thoughts occur, and are you willing to avoid alcohol when they happen and accept a brief check-in tonight?\nPatient: No firearms in the house. The prescription pills are kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet and I use a pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 I handle and check them every night, so access is easy. I\u2019m willing to have them secured, removed, or put in a lockbox tonight; I\u2019d prefer you or a trusted person do that rather than involving my wife.\n\nMy neighbor is Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456 \u2014 she\u2019s agreed to be contacted and to do brief check-ins. I usually have a drink or two a few nights a week and sometimes a bit more on bad nights, but I will avoid alcohol when these thoughts occur and I accept a brief check-in tonight.\n\nPlease coordinate this with me and don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Martin, over the past few weeks to months have you been eating more, less, or about the same, and have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain (even a rough number of pounds)? Have your meal patterns changed (skipping meals, overeating, using food to cope), and have any of these changes affected your energy or your ability to manage medications and care for your wife?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been eating a bit less overall the last few months \u2014 I\u2019ve lost maybe five to ten pounds without trying. I often skip breakfast or eat very little in the morning because I\u2019m up at night, and then I\u2019ll snack or eat more late when my anxiety spikes. It hasn\u2019t left me constantly wiped out, but the combination of poor sleep and skipping meals makes routine jobs take longer and I\u2019m more irritable about small things. Sometimes it makes managing meds and the household more effortful and slower than it used to be, though I still get most of it done.\nDoctor: Martin, can you tell me whether you feel fatigued or have low energy most days, and if so would you say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe; is it worse in the morning or evening, and do you nap or fall asleep unintentionally during the day? \n\nAlso, how much does this fatigue interfere with your caregiving and household tasks (not much, some, or a lot), and are there any new medical problems or medications recently that might cause tiredness?\nPatient: Look \u2014 I don\u2019t have low energy most days. I get occasional, mild tiredness, mainly the mornings after a bad night\u2019s sleep. I almost never nap or nod off during the day. \n\nIt does slow me down: chores and meds take more time and feel more effortful, so there\u2019s some interference, but I still get most of the caregiving and household tasks done. No new medical problems or new medications that would explain the tiredness.\nDoctor: Martin, how often do you have trouble concentrating or feel indecisive (days per week or times per day)? For example, do you have trouble paying bills, following conversations, or remembering steps for medications \u2014 has this gotten worse recently, and how much does it interfere with caregiving or safety (not much, some, or a lot)? Do these problems seem tied to poor sleep or anxiety, or do they feel more like slowed thinking versus simple forgetfulness?\nPatient: Not often \u2014 maybe once or twice a week at most. When it happens it\u2019s more like slowed thinking after a bad night or a spike of anxiety, not true forgetfulness. I might take longer to follow a conversation or to work through the steps for a task, but it hasn\u2019t caused any safety problems.\n\nIt does make chores and med routines take longer \u2014 so there\u2019s some interference \u2014 but I still manage things with my pill sorter and whatever systems I\u2019ve set up. I don\u2019t see a clear recent worsening beyond the sleep and anxiety pattern.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 have you been feeling worthless or excessively guilty, and if so how often (days per week)? Can you give examples of what you tell yourself (for instance blaming yourself for your wife's care), do these feelings feel out of proportion, and how much do they interfere with caregiving or daily tasks? And do these feelings make thoughts of suicide more likely or stronger?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 I feel that guilt and worthlessness several days a week, roughly three to four days. I tell myself I\u2019m failing my wife, that I missed something I should\u2019ve caught, and I replay little mistakes until they feel huge. I snap at the kids sometimes over small things and then immediately feel guilty about it. \n\nI know the guilt is out of proportion to the facts, but it still weighs on me and makes routine things harder. Tasks take more effort and take longer, I get more irritable, and managing meds or household chores becomes more of a strain \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, but I\u2019m still doing the work.\n\nIt gets worse after nights with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating; those nights also make the fleeting thoughts about being better off dead more likely to pop up, but they never turn into plans or intent.\nDoctor: I hear that \u2014 thanks for being clear. How long have these guilt and worthlessness feelings been present (weeks, months, years), and have you had similar episodes in the past or received treatment before (talk therapy, medications, or anything else)? Do the guilty feelings ever make you avoid tasks or withdraw from caregiving, and what, if anything, do you do that helps when the guilt spikes?\nPatient: This has been going on for several months. I\u2019ve had milder bouts like this years ago but never any sustained treatment \u2014 I tried a caregiver support group once and spoke with a social worker, but I didn\u2019t continue with therapy or medications.\n\nThe guilt and worthlessness don\u2019t usually stop me from doing the caregiving \u2014 I still get the tasks done \u2014 but they do make me withdraw emotionally, get irritable, snap at people, and increase my checking and pacing. When it spikes I lean on routines: pill sorter, lists and checklists, breaking tasks into small steps, and short walks or pacing to burn off the agitation. I\u2019ll also avoid alcohol when the thoughts come up.\nDoctor: In the past two weeks, on how many days have you felt less interest or pleasure in things (zero to seven days), and what specific activities have you lost interest in or started avoiding (hobbies, social visits, reading, TV, projects around the house)? \n\nIs there anything that still brings you pleasure, and how has this loss of interest affected your caregiving, chores, and relationships \u2014 has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?\nPatient: About three to four days a week over the past two weeks I\u2019ve felt less interest or pleasure. I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.\nDoctor: You mentioned both pacing/restlessness and feeling slowed down \u2014 how often does each happen (days per week or times per day/night) and which pattern is more typical for you; can you give a concrete example of a time one of these interfered with a task or safety? \n\nHave others noticed these changes, do they tend to fluctuate with poor sleep or rumination, and are there any medications or medical problems that might explain them?\nPatient: Both happen. The restless pacing occurs several nights a week \u2014 when I\u2019m stuck replaying things I\u2019ll get up and pace in short bursts multiple times a night. The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps. The kids have pointed out I\u2019m snappier and slower lately, and it definitely gets worse with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating. There aren\u2019t any new medications or medical issues that would explain it.\nDoctor: Martin, what are your usual bedtime and wake time, and how many hours do you sleep on a good night versus a bad night; how long does it take you to fall asleep, how many times do you wake each night and about how long are you awake when you do? \n\nDo you tend to wake earlier than you want, do you nap (how long), and do you use alcohol or any sleep medicines to help fall asleep? \n\nHow much do these sleep problems interfere with caregiving or safety (for example delayed morning routines, medication mistakes, or driving)? Improving sleep often helps mood and concentration \u2014 would you be willing to try some short-term sleep strategies now or consider further sleep-focused treatment?\nPatient: Usually I go to bed around 11:00 pm and get up about 6:30 am. On a decent night I get six to seven hours; on a bad night I\u2019ll only get two to three. It typically takes me 45\u201390 minutes to fall asleep.\n\nI wake multiple times most nights \u2014 a few short awakenings or a couple longer ones \u2014 and on bad nights I\u2019m cumulatively awake for 30 to 120-plus minutes. Sometimes I wake up early, around 4 or 5 am, and lie there replaying things. I almost never nap during the day.\n\nI do have a drink or two a few nights a week and I\u2019ve used alcohol sometimes to try to sleep, especially on bad nights, but I don\u2019t take sleep meds regularly. \n\nThe poor sleep delays my mornings, leads to extra checking and pacing, and makes mornings slower and clumsier \u2014 chores and med management take more time and effort (some to moderate interference), though I still get most tasks done. I\u2019ll try short\u2011term sleep strategies now and I\u2019m open to more sleep\u2011focused treatment if that\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks \u2014 I appreciate your willingness to try this. Would you like me to contact Rita right now to ask her to secure or remove the medications tonight, or will you put them in a lockbox or otherwise secure them yourself? \n\nCan you confirm you\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and that you accept a brief check\u2011in from Rita tonight? Which one or two short sleep strategies would you be willing to try tonight \u2014 for example a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed, leaving the bed after about 20\u201330 minutes awake to do a quiet activity, and limiting screens/caffeine after mid\u2011afternoon \u2014 which of those (or others) do you prefer? \n\nFinally, do you feel safe being alone tonight, or would you like me to arrange any additional support this evening?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 please contact Rita now to secure or remove the medications tonight. Don\u2019t involve my wife; coordinate this with me and have Rita handle the check/lockup. Rita Morales, (555) 012-3456, has agreed to be contacted.\n\nI\u2019ll avoid alcohol this evening and I accept a brief check\u2011in from her tonight. For sleep, I\u2019ll do a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down before bed (low light, no screens, quiet reading or light walking) and if I\u2019m not asleep after about 20\u201330 minutes I\u2019ll get up and do a quiet activity until I feel sleepy again. \n\nI feel safe being alone tonight as long as the meds are secured and Rita checks in; I don\u2019t need any more support right now unless my risk increases.\nDoctor: Do I have your permission to call Rita now to arrange securing the medications \u2014 you said they\u2019re in the bathroom medicine cabinet and the pill sorter on the kitchen counter \u2014 do you want her to remove them from the house or place them in a lockbox, will she need a key or code, and will you be there when she does it? \n\nWhat exact time should Rita check in tonight and what\u2019s the best number to reach you; I won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases, and if your suicidal thoughts intensify this evening please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department immediately, or contact me/our clinic or Rita for help \u2014 shall I call Rita now?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 call Rita now. Prefer the meds removed from the house if possible; a lockbox is fine if removal isn\u2019t doable. Rita doesn\u2019t need a key \u2014 I\u2019ll be home and will let her in. Ask her to take the pill sorter and the prescription bottles or otherwise secure them in a lockbox tonight. Have her do a brief check\u2011in at about 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nBest number to reach me for coordination is (555) 987\u20116543. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Call Rita now.\nDoctor: I\u2019ll call Rita now and arrange for her to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox tonight; you\u2019ll be home to let her in and she should do a brief check\u2011in around 9:30\u201310:00 PM. \n\nJust confirming numbers: Rita Morales (555) 012\u20113456 and your number (555) 987\u20116543 \u2014 you\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight and accept her check\u2011in, and I will not involve your wife unless your risk increases. \n\nIf your suicidal thoughts intensify, call 911 or go to the nearest ED immediately, or contact our clinic or Rita for help; do you want me to stay on the line while I call Rita now, or shall I call and then update you?\nPatient: Call Rita now. You don\u2019t need to stay on the line \u2014 call and then update me. I\u2019ll be home to let her in and I accept the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in. I\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases.\n\nRita Morales: (555) 012\u20113456. My number: (555) 987\u20116543.\nDoctor: Okay, Martin \u2014 I\u2019ll call Rita now to ask her to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox tonight and to do a brief check\u2011in between 9:30\u201310:00 PM; I\u2019ll coordinate directly with you, won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases, and I\u2019ll update you when the call is complete. \n\nIf your suicidal thoughts intensify at any point, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department \u2014 any last\u2011minute change to the check\u2011in time, phone numbers, or access before I place the call?\nPatient: No changes \u2014 the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in stands. Rita should remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles or secure them in a lockbox; I\u2019ll be home to let her in. Numbers are correct: Rita Morales (555) 012\u20113456 and my number (555) 987\u20116543. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Call Rita now and update me when the call is complete. Thanks.\nDoctor: Thanks, Martin \u2014 I appreciate you being direct and agreeing to these steps. I\u2019ll call Rita now to arrange removal or lockbox of the pill sorter and prescription bottles and to have her do a brief check\u2011in around 9:30\u201310:00 PM; I won\u2019t involve your wife unless your risk increases and I\u2019ll update you when the call is done. \n\nIf your thoughts intensify tonight, please call 911 or go to the nearest ED, or contact our clinic; anything else you want me to address before I place the call?\nPatient: Call Rita now \u2014 you have my permission. Remove the meds if possible; lockbox is fine if not. I\u2019ll be home to let her in. I\u2019ll avoid alcohol tonight and I accept the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Update me briefly when the call is done. Thanks.\nDoctor: Any parking or entrance notes for Rita I should tell her, and do you want to be on the call or should I call her independently (you previously said independently, but I\u2019ll follow your preference)? \n\nCalling Rita now \u2014 update: I reached her at (555) 012\u20113456; she agrees to remove the pill sorter and prescription bottles tonight (or secure them in a lockbox if removal isn\u2019t possible), will come by while you\u2019re home to let her in, and will do the brief 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in you requested. \n\nI won\u2019t involve your wife unless risk increases; I\u2019ll let you know if anything changes. If your thoughts intensify tonight, call 911 or go to the nearest ED immediately.\nPatient: Fine \u2014 glad you reached her and that\u2019s acceptable. No parking or entrance notes; she can use the front door/driveway. I preferred you call her independently, not put me on the call. Don\u2019t involve my wife unless my risk increases. Please give me a brief update when coordination is complete or if anything changes. Thanks.\nDoctor: Martin \u2014 do you feel depressed, empty, or hopeless most of the day, nearly every day, or only on some days? How long has that pattern been present (weeks, months, years), is it pervasive across the day or mainly at night when you\u2019re ruminating, and would you say you feel more sad overall or more irritable?\nPatient: It\u2019s not every day \u2014 more like several days a week, and it\u2019s been going on for a few months. It\u2019s worst at night when I\u2019m ruminating and pacing, and those nights often spill into the next day if I\u2019ve slept poorly. \n\nOverall I\u2019m more irritable than flatly hopeless, though there\u2019s sadness and a drained feeling too. It does get in the way \u2014 chores and caregiving take more effort, I\u2019m slower in the mornings, and I snap at people more \u2014 so there\u2019s definite interference, especially after bad nights.\nDoctor: That fits with the load you\u2019re carrying and the sleep problems \u2014 thanks for being direct and for agreeing to the safety steps. Rita will secure the meds and do the 9:30\u201310:00 PM check\u2011in; I\u2019ll update you when that\u2019s done and I\u2019d like to arrange a brief follow\u2011up to review sleep and mood \u2014 would you prefer a phone check\u2011in in 3 days or an in\u2011person visit next week? \n\nIf your thoughts intensify at any point tonight, call 911 or go to the nearest ED, or contact our clinic or Rita; is there anything else you want to say before I finish?\nPatient: Phone check\u2011in in three days. I\u2019m available that evening between 6:00 and 7:30 PM. \n\nPlease give me a brief update after Rita secures or removes the meds tonight. For the follow\u2011up, focus on sleep strategies and mood tracking \u2014 practical steps I can try and what to watch for. \n\nDo not involve my wife unless my risk increases. If my thoughts intensify tonight I will call 911. \n\nThanks.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
