Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

How long have you been feeling like this? Is the tiredness every day or most days? When you say sleep\u2019s bad, is it trouble falling asleep, waking during the night, or waking too early? And are these problems making work or daily responsibilities harder for you?\nPatient: A few months. Tired most days. I can't fall asleep easily and wake up a lot during the night \u2014 sleep's fragmented. It's slowing me down at work, more little mistakes, but I'm managing \u2014 not catastrophic.\nDoctor: I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been so worn down, Noah \u2014 thanks for telling me. I need to ask an important question: have you had any thoughts about death, dying, or hurting yourself?\nPatient: No. I don't have any plan or intent.

Can I do a very brief safety plan now? What\u2019s one warning sign you\u2019d notice, one thing you could do to calm yourself in the moment, who would you realistically call first, and just to confirm \u2014 no guns or large supplies of meds at home?\nPatient: When I start obsessing and feel totally hopeless.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared.

How long have you been feeling like this? Is the tiredness every day or most days? When you say sleep\u2019s bad, is it trouble falling asleep, waking during the night, or waking too early? And are these problems making work or daily responsibilities harder for you?\nPatient: A few months. Tired most days.

I need to ask an important question: have you had any thoughts about death, dying, or hurting yourself?\nPatient: No. I don't have any plan or intent. Sometimes I get brief thoughts about death, but I wouldn't act on them and I'm managing for now.\nDoctor: Thanks, Noah \u2014 I appreciate you being honest.

Can I do a very brief safety plan now? What\u2019s one warning sign you\u2019d notice, one thing you could do to calm yourself in the moment, who would you realistically call first, and just to confirm \u2014 no guns or large supplies of meds at home?\nPatient: When I start obsessing and feel totally hopeless. I'll get up and go for a walk or put on music and breathe. I'd call my friend Alex.

Have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy \u2014 hobbies, hanging out with friends, or sex \u2014 how long has that been, and is it making day-to-day life harder?\nPatient: Yeah \u2014 a few months.

Are they getting in the way of your work or relationships? I can see how draining this is.\nPatient: Yeah \u2014 a few times a week I feel worthless or guilty. I pull away, cancel plans, lose motivation; it makes me slower and I make more little mistakes at work and it amps up fights at home. Still managing day-to-day though \u2014 annoying, not catastrophic.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Noah \u2014 quick question: have you felt physically slowed down in your movements or speech, or more restless and fidgety lately? How often does that happen, do other people notice, and is it getting worse or making work or daily tasks harder?\nPatient: No. I\u2019m not physically slowed or more restless. Nobody\u2019s said anything. It\u2019s just fatigue and brain\u2011fog that makes me slower at tasks, not slowed movements or fidgeting.\nDoctor: Thanks, Noah \u2014 one quick question: over the past few months have you noticed any big changes in your appetite or weight (eating much more or much less, or any unintentional weight loss or gain)? If so, about how much and has that change affected your energy or ability to get through the day?\nPatient: No \u2014 no big weight change.

How long have you been feeling like this? Is the tiredness every day or most days? When you say sleep\u2019s bad, is it trouble falling asleep, waking during the night, or waking too early? And are these problems making work or daily responsibilities harder for you?\nPatient: A few months. Tired most days. I can't fall asleep easily and wake up a lot during the night \u2014 sleep's fragmented. It's slowing me down at work, more little mistakes, but I'm managing \u2014 not catastrophic.\nDoctor: I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been so worn down, Noah \u2014 thanks for telling me. I need to ask an important question: have you had any thoughts about death, dying, or hurting yourself?\nPatient: No. I don't have any plan or intent. Sometimes I get brief thoughts about death, but I wouldn't act on them and I'm managing for now.\nDoctor: Thanks, Noah \u2014 I appreciate you being honest. Can I ask: how often do those thoughts come up, have they been getting stronger recently, have you ever tried to hurt yourself before, do you have access to medications, firearms, or anything you could use, and are there people you can turn to right now \u2014 would you be comfortable making a brief safety plan with me if that might help?\nPatient: A few times a month. They\u2019re brief and not getting worse. I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself. No plan or intent. I don\u2019t have access to guns or a big supply of meds. I\u2019ve got a couple people I could contact, though I\u2019d rather not. I\u2019m skeptical a safety plan will help, but I\u2019ll do a brief one if you think it\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: Thanks, Noah \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and that you\u2019ll try this even if you\u2019re skeptical. Can I do a very brief safety plan now? What\u2019s one warning sign you\u2019d notice, one thing you could do to calm yourself in the moment, who would you realistically call first, and just to confirm \u2014 no guns or large supplies of meds at home?\nPatient: When I start obsessing and feel totally hopeless. I'll get up and go for a walk or put on music and breathe. I'd call my friend Alex. No guns or large supplies of meds at home.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have those strategies and someone to call \u2014 thanks, Noah. Have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy \u2014 hobbies, hanging out with friends, or sex \u2014 how long has that been, and is it making day-to-day life harder?\nPatient: Yeah \u2014 a few months. I cancel plans sometimes, hobbies aren\u2019t fun and sex\u2019s less interesting. It\u2019s harder day-to-day \u2014 less motivation, more little mistakes at work \u2014 but I\u2019m still managing, not catastrophic.\nDoctor: Noah, over the past few months have you been feeling worthless, overly guilty, or like a burden to others \u2014 and how often do those feelings come up? Are they getting in the way of your work or relationships? I can see how draining this is.\nPatient: Yeah \u2014 a few times a week I feel worthless or guilty. I pull away, cancel plans, lose motivation; it makes me slower and I make more little mistakes at work and it amps up fights at home. Still managing day-to-day though \u2014 annoying, not catastrophic.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Noah \u2014 quick question: have you felt physically slowed down in your movements or speech, or more restless and fidgety lately? How often does that happen, do other people notice, and is it getting worse or making work or daily tasks harder?\nPatient: No. I\u2019m not physically slowed or more restless. Nobody\u2019s said anything. It\u2019s just fatigue and brain\u2011fog that makes me slower at tasks, not slowed movements or fidgeting.\nDoctor: Thanks, Noah \u2014 one quick question: over the past few months have you noticed any big changes in your appetite or weight (eating much more or much less, or any unintentional weight loss or gain)? If so, about how much and has that change affected your energy or ability to get through the day?\nPatient: No \u2014 no big weight change.

I\u2019m skeptical a safety plan will help, but I\u2019ll do a brief one if you think it\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: Thanks, Noah \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and that you\u2019ll try this even if you\u2019re skeptical. Can I do a very brief safety plan now? What\u2019s one warning sign you\u2019d notice, one thing you could do to calm yourself in the moment, who would you realistically call first, and just to confirm \u2014 no guns or large supplies of meds at home?\nPatient: When I start obsessing and feel totally hopeless. I'll get up and go for a walk or put on music and breathe. I'd call my friend Alex. No guns or large supplies of meds at home.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have those strategies and someone to call \u2014 thanks, Noah. Have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy \u2014 hobbies, hanging out with friends, or sex \u2014 how long has that been, and is it making day-to-day life harder?\nPatient: Yeah \u2014 a few months. I cancel plans sometimes, hobbies aren\u2019t fun and sex\u2019s less interesting. It\u2019s harder day-to-day \u2014 less motivation, more little mistakes at work \u2014 but I\u2019m still managing, not catastrophic.\nDoctor: Noah, over the past few months have you been feeling worthless, overly guilty, or like a burden to others \u2014 and how often do those feelings come up? Are they getting in the way of your work or relationships? I can see how draining this is.\nPatient: Yeah \u2014 a few times a week I feel worthless or guilty. I pull away, cancel plans, lose motivation; it makes me slower and I make more little mistakes at work and it amps up fights at home. Still managing day-to-day though \u2014 annoying, not catastrophic.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Noah \u2014 quick question: have you felt physically slowed down in your movements or speech, or more restless and fidgety lately? How often does that happen, do other people notice, and is it getting worse or making work or daily tasks harder?\nPatient: No. I\u2019m not physically slowed or more restless. Nobody\u2019s said anything. It\u2019s just fatigue and brain\u2011fog that makes me slower at tasks, not slowed movements or fidgeting.\nDoctor: Thanks, Noah \u2014 one quick question: over the past few months have you noticed any big changes in your appetite or weight (eating much more or much less, or any unintentional weight loss or gain)? If so, about how much and has that change affected your energy or ability to get through the day?\nPatient: No \u2014 no big weight change. I eat less some days, but it's rare and hasn't really affected my energy or functioning.\nDoctor: Noah, have you been feeling sad, empty, or down most days over the past few months? How often\u2014every day or some days\u2014and do those feelings last most of the day or come in brief spells? Is this low mood getting in the way of work or things at home? I know keeping up with work and living with family while feeling this way is really draining.\nPatient: Yeah \u2014 I\u2019ve been down most days for a few months. It lasts most of the day and it\u2019s making work and home harder \u2014 more mistakes, I pull away and fights start. I\u2019m still getting by, just drained.\nDoctor: Noah, that sounds exhausting \u2014 thank you for keeping me posted and for managing as much as you are. Is it okay if we talk briefly about next steps and what help you\u2019d be willing to try (brief therapy, sleep strategies, medication, or other supports), and just to confirm your safety plan \u2014 walking, music, and calling Alex \u2014 is still something you can use if things get worse?\nPatient: Yeah. Walking, music, and calling Alex still work. I'll try sleep strategies and a short, structured therapy trial. I'm skeptical about meds and don't want to start them now. I want practical, short-term steps, not open-ended therapy.\nDoctor: I hear you, Noah \u2014 thanks.

Are they causing anything beyond little mistakes \u2014 missed deadlines, bigger errors, or trouble finishing tasks?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nI hear you, Noah \u2014 thanks.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: I'm fine. Been tired a lot, sleep's bad and my focus slips sometimes \u2014 a bit indecisive on small stuff, but I'm handling it, not a big deal.\nDoctor: I hear you, Noah \u2014 that sounds really tiring, thanks for sharing. How long have you been feeling like this? Is the tiredness every day or most days? When you say sleep\u2019s bad, is it trouble falling asleep, waking during the night, or waking too early? And are these problems making work or daily responsibilities harder for you?\nPatient: A few months. Tired most days. I can't fall asleep easily and wake up a lot during the night \u2014 sleep's fragmented. It's slowing me down at work, more little mistakes, but I'm managing \u2014 not catastrophic.\nDoctor: I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been so worn down, Noah \u2014 thanks for telling me. I need to ask an important question: have you had any thoughts about death, dying, or hurting yourself?\nPatient: No. I don't have any plan or intent. Sometimes I get brief thoughts about death, but I wouldn't act on them and I'm managing for now.\nDoctor: Thanks, Noah \u2014 I appreciate you being honest. Can I ask: how often do those thoughts come up, have they been getting stronger recently, have you ever tried to hurt yourself before, do you have access to medications, firearms, or anything you could use, and are there people you can turn to right now \u2014 would you be comfortable making a brief safety plan with me if that might help?\nPatient: A few times a month. They\u2019re brief and not getting worse. I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself. No plan or intent. I don\u2019t have access to guns or a big supply of meds. I\u2019ve got a couple people I could contact, though I\u2019d rather not. I\u2019m skeptical a safety plan will help, but I\u2019ll do a brief one if you think it\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: Thanks, Noah \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and that you\u2019ll try this even if you\u2019re skeptical. Can I do a very brief safety plan now? What\u2019s one warning sign you\u2019d notice, one thing you could do to calm yourself in the moment, who would you realistically call first, and just to confirm \u2014 no guns or large supplies of meds at home?\nPatient: When I start obsessing and feel totally hopeless. I'll get up and go for a walk or put on music and breathe. I'd call my friend Alex. No guns or large supplies of meds at home.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have those strategies and someone to call \u2014 thanks, Noah. Have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy \u2014 hobbies, hanging out with friends, or sex \u2014 how long has that been, and is it making day-to-day life harder?\nPatient: Yeah \u2014 a few months. I cancel plans sometimes, hobbies aren\u2019t fun and sex\u2019s less interesting. It\u2019s harder day-to-day \u2014 less motivation, more little mistakes at work \u2014 but I\u2019m still managing, not catastrophic.\nDoctor: Noah, over the past few months have you been feeling worthless, overly guilty, or like a burden to others \u2014 and how often do those feelings come up? Are they getting in the way of your work or relationships? I can see how draining this is.\nPatient: Yeah \u2014 a few times a week I feel worthless or guilty. I pull away, cancel plans, lose motivation; it makes me slower and I make more little mistakes at work and it amps up fights at home. Still managing day-to-day though \u2014 annoying, not catastrophic.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Noah \u2014 quick question: have you felt physically slowed down in your movements or speech, or more restless and fidgety lately? How often does that happen, do other people notice, and is it getting worse or making work or daily tasks harder?\nPatient: No. I\u2019m not physically slowed or more restless. Nobody\u2019s said anything. It\u2019s just fatigue and brain\u2011fog that makes me slower at tasks, not slowed movements or fidgeting.\nDoctor: Thanks, Noah \u2014 one quick question: over the past few months have you noticed any big changes in your appetite or weight (eating much more or much less, or any unintentional weight loss or gain)? If so, about how much and has that change affected your energy or ability to get through the day?\nPatient: No \u2014 no big weight change. I eat less some days, but it's rare and hasn't really affected my energy or functioning.\nDoctor: Noah, have you been feeling sad, empty, or down most days over the past few months? How often\u2014every day or some days\u2014and do those feelings last most of the day or come in brief spells? Is this low mood getting in the way of work or things at home? I know keeping up with work and living with family while feeling this way is really draining.\nPatient: Yeah \u2014 I\u2019ve been down most days for a few months. It lasts most of the day and it\u2019s making work and home harder \u2014 more mistakes, I pull away and fights start. I\u2019m still getting by, just drained.\nDoctor: Noah, that sounds exhausting \u2014 thank you for keeping me posted and for managing as much as you are. Is it okay if we talk briefly about next steps and what help you\u2019d be willing to try (brief therapy, sleep strategies, medication, or other supports), and just to confirm your safety plan \u2014 walking, music, and calling Alex \u2014 is still something you can use if things get worse?\nPatient: Yeah. Walking, music, and calling Alex still work. I'll try sleep strategies and a short, structured therapy trial. I'm skeptical about meds and don't want to start them now. I want practical, short-term steps, not open-ended therapy.\nDoctor: I hear you, Noah \u2014 thanks. About those focus slips and indecisiveness: do they happen every day or only some days, and do they last most of the day or come in short episodes? Are they causing anything beyond little mistakes \u2014 missed deadlines, bigger errors, or trouble finishing tasks?\nPatient: Most days. It lasts much of the day or comes in long spells. I have trouble finishing tasks, make more little mistakes and have missed a few deadlines \u2014 it slows me down and it's annoying, but I'm still managing, not catastrophic.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and draining, Noah \u2014 I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with that. Have those missed deadlines put your job at risk or led to any formal consequences, and how often are you missing them? When you do get stuck, what (if anything) helps you refocus and finish a task, and would you be willing to try brief practical strategies like checklists, chunking tasks, short deadline extensions, or telling a supervisor to reduce errors?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat sounds really frustrating and draining, Noah \u2014 I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with that.

How long have you been feeling like this? Is the tiredness every day or most days? When you say sleep\u2019s bad, is it trouble falling asleep, waking during the night, or waking too early? And are these problems making work or daily responsibilities harder for you?\nPatient: A few months. Tired most days. I can't fall asleep easily and wake up a lot during the night \u2014 sleep's fragmented. It's slowing me down at work, more little mistakes, but I'm managing \u2014 not catastrophic.\nDoctor: I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been so worn down, Noah \u2014 thanks for telling me. I need to ask an important question: have you had any thoughts about death, dying, or hurting yourself?\nPatient: No. I don't have any plan or intent. Sometimes I get brief thoughts about death, but I wouldn't act on them and I'm managing for now.\nDoctor: Thanks, Noah \u2014 I appreciate you being honest. Can I ask: how often do those thoughts come up, have they been getting stronger recently, have you ever tried to hurt yourself before, do you have access to medications, firearms, or anything you could use, and are there people you can turn to right now \u2014 would you be comfortable making a brief safety plan with me if that might help?\nPatient: A few times a month. They\u2019re brief and not getting worse. I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself. No plan or intent. I don\u2019t have access to guns or a big supply of meds. I\u2019ve got a couple people I could contact, though I\u2019d rather not. I\u2019m skeptical a safety plan will help, but I\u2019ll do a brief one if you think it\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: Thanks, Noah \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and that you\u2019ll try this even if you\u2019re skeptical. Can I do a very brief safety plan now? What\u2019s one warning sign you\u2019d notice, one thing you could do to calm yourself in the moment, who would you realistically call first, and just to confirm \u2014 no guns or large supplies of meds at home?\nPatient: When I start obsessing and feel totally hopeless. I'll get up and go for a walk or put on music and breathe. I'd call my friend Alex. No guns or large supplies of meds at home.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have those strategies and someone to call \u2014 thanks, Noah. Have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy \u2014 hobbies, hanging out with friends, or sex \u2014 how long has that been, and is it making day-to-day life harder?\nPatient: Yeah \u2014 a few months. I cancel plans sometimes, hobbies aren\u2019t fun and sex\u2019s less interesting. It\u2019s harder day-to-day \u2014 less motivation, more little mistakes at work \u2014 but I\u2019m still managing, not catastrophic.\nDoctor: Noah, over the past few months have you been feeling worthless, overly guilty, or like a burden to others \u2014 and how often do those feelings come up? Are they getting in the way of your work or relationships? I can see how draining this is.\nPatient: Yeah \u2014 a few times a week I feel worthless or guilty. I pull away, cancel plans, lose motivation; it makes me slower and I make more little mistakes at work and it amps up fights at home. Still managing day-to-day though \u2014 annoying, not catastrophic.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Noah \u2014 quick question: have you felt physically slowed down in your movements or speech, or more restless and fidgety lately? How often does that happen, do other people notice, and is it getting worse or making work or daily tasks harder?\nPatient: No. I\u2019m not physically slowed or more restless. Nobody\u2019s said anything. It\u2019s just fatigue and brain\u2011fog that makes me slower at tasks, not slowed movements or fidgeting.\nDoctor: Thanks, Noah \u2014 one quick question: over the past few months have you noticed any big changes in your appetite or weight (eating much more or much less, or any unintentional weight loss or gain)? If so, about how much and has that change affected your energy or ability to get through the day?\nPatient: No \u2014 no big weight change. I eat less some days, but it's rare and hasn't really affected my energy or functioning.\nDoctor: Noah, have you been feeling sad, empty, or down most days over the past few months? How often\u2014every day or some days\u2014and do those feelings last most of the day or come in brief spells? Is this low mood getting in the way of work or things at home? I know keeping up with work and living with family while feeling this way is really draining.\nPatient: Yeah \u2014 I\u2019ve been down most days for a few months. It lasts most of the day and it\u2019s making work and home harder \u2014 more mistakes, I pull away and fights start. I\u2019m still getting by, just drained.\nDoctor: Noah, that sounds exhausting \u2014 thank you for keeping me posted and for managing as much as you are. Is it okay if we talk briefly about next steps and what help you\u2019d be willing to try (brief therapy, sleep strategies, medication, or other supports), and just to confirm your safety plan \u2014 walking, music, and calling Alex \u2014 is still something you can use if things get worse?\nPatient: Yeah. Walking, music, and calling Alex still work. I'll try sleep strategies and a short, structured therapy trial. I'm skeptical about meds and don't want to start them now. I want practical, short-term steps, not open-ended therapy.\nDoctor: I hear you, Noah \u2014 thanks. About those focus slips and indecisiveness: do they happen every day or only some days, and do they last most of the day or come in short episodes? Are they causing anything beyond little mistakes \u2014 missed deadlines, bigger errors, or trouble finishing tasks?\nPatient: Most days. It lasts much of the day or comes in long spells. I have trouble finishing tasks, make more little mistakes and have missed a few deadlines \u2014 it slows me down and it's annoying, but I'm still managing, not catastrophic.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and draining, Noah \u2014 I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with that. Have those missed deadlines put your job at risk or led to any formal consequences, and how often are you missing them? When you do get stuck, what (if anything) helps you refocus and finish a task, and would you be willing to try brief practical strategies like checklists, chunking tasks, short deadline extensions, or telling a supervisor to reduce errors?\nPatient: I've missed a few deadlines \u2014 no formal discipline yet, my supervisor complained once. Short walks, music, timers and breaking tasks into tiny chunks help; I'll try checklists, chunking and short extensions but I won't tell my supervisor unless I have to.\nDoctor: Good \u2014 those sound like practical steps, Noah.

I need to ask an important question: have you had any thoughts about death, dying, or hurting yourself?\nPatient: No. I don't have any plan or intent. Sometimes I get brief thoughts about death, but I wouldn't act on them and I'm managing for now.\nDoctor: Thanks, Noah \u2014 I appreciate you being honest. Can I ask: how often do those thoughts come up, have they been getting stronger recently, have you ever tried to hurt yourself before, do you have access to medications, firearms, or anything you could use, and are there people you can turn to right now \u2014 would you be comfortable making a brief safety plan with me if that might help?\nPatient: A few times a month. They\u2019re brief and not getting worse. I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself. No plan or intent. I don\u2019t have access to guns or a big supply of meds. I\u2019ve got a couple people I could contact, though I\u2019d rather not. I\u2019m skeptical a safety plan will help, but I\u2019ll do a brief one if you think it\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: Thanks, Noah \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and that you\u2019ll try this even if you\u2019re skeptical. Can I do a very brief safety plan now? What\u2019s one warning sign you\u2019d notice, one thing you could do to calm yourself in the moment, who would you realistically call first, and just to confirm \u2014 no guns or large supplies of meds at home?\nPatient: When I start obsessing and feel totally hopeless. I'll get up and go for a walk or put on music and breathe. I'd call my friend Alex. No guns or large supplies of meds at home.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have those strategies and someone to call \u2014 thanks, Noah. Have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy \u2014 hobbies, hanging out with friends, or sex \u2014 how long has that been, and is it making day-to-day life harder?\nPatient: Yeah \u2014 a few months. I cancel plans sometimes, hobbies aren\u2019t fun and sex\u2019s less interesting. It\u2019s harder day-to-day \u2014 less motivation, more little mistakes at work \u2014 but I\u2019m still managing, not catastrophic.\nDoctor: Noah, over the past few months have you been feeling worthless, overly guilty, or like a burden to others \u2014 and how often do those feelings come up? Are they getting in the way of your work or relationships? I can see how draining this is.\nPatient: Yeah \u2014 a few times a week I feel worthless or guilty. I pull away, cancel plans, lose motivation; it makes me slower and I make more little mistakes at work and it amps up fights at home. Still managing day-to-day though \u2014 annoying, not catastrophic.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Noah \u2014 quick question: have you felt physically slowed down in your movements or speech, or more restless and fidgety lately? How often does that happen, do other people notice, and is it getting worse or making work or daily tasks harder?\nPatient: No. I\u2019m not physically slowed or more restless. Nobody\u2019s said anything. It\u2019s just fatigue and brain\u2011fog that makes me slower at tasks, not slowed movements or fidgeting.\nDoctor: Thanks, Noah \u2014 one quick question: over the past few months have you noticed any big changes in your appetite or weight (eating much more or much less, or any unintentional weight loss or gain)? If so, about how much and has that change affected your energy or ability to get through the day?\nPatient: No \u2014 no big weight change. I eat less some days, but it's rare and hasn't really affected my energy or functioning.\nDoctor: Noah, have you been feeling sad, empty, or down most days over the past few months? How often\u2014every day or some days\u2014and do those feelings last most of the day or come in brief spells? Is this low mood getting in the way of work or things at home? I know keeping up with work and living with family while feeling this way is really draining.\nPatient: Yeah \u2014 I\u2019ve been down most days for a few months. It lasts most of the day and it\u2019s making work and home harder \u2014 more mistakes, I pull away and fights start. I\u2019m still getting by, just drained.\nDoctor: Noah, that sounds exhausting \u2014 thank you for keeping me posted and for managing as much as you are. Is it okay if we talk briefly about next steps and what help you\u2019d be willing to try (brief therapy, sleep strategies, medication, or other supports), and just to confirm your safety plan \u2014 walking, music, and calling Alex \u2014 is still something you can use if things get worse?\nPatient: Yeah. Walking, music, and calling Alex still work. I'll try sleep strategies and a short, structured therapy trial. I'm skeptical about meds and don't want to start them now. I want practical, short-term steps, not open-ended therapy.\nDoctor: I hear you, Noah \u2014 thanks. About those focus slips and indecisiveness: do they happen every day or only some days, and do they last most of the day or come in short episodes? Are they causing anything beyond little mistakes \u2014 missed deadlines, bigger errors, or trouble finishing tasks?\nPatient: Most days. It lasts much of the day or comes in long spells. I have trouble finishing tasks, make more little mistakes and have missed a few deadlines \u2014 it slows me down and it's annoying, but I'm still managing, not catastrophic.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and draining, Noah \u2014 I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with that. Have those missed deadlines put your job at risk or led to any formal consequences, and how often are you missing them? When you do get stuck, what (if anything) helps you refocus and finish a task, and would you be willing to try brief practical strategies like checklists, chunking tasks, short deadline extensions, or telling a supervisor to reduce errors?\nPatient: I've missed a few deadlines \u2014 no formal discipline yet, my supervisor complained once. Short walks, music, timers and breaking tasks into tiny chunks help; I'll try checklists, chunking and short extensions but I won't tell my supervisor unless I have to.\nDoctor: Good \u2014 those sound like practical steps, Noah. You said you\u2019re tired most days: is it more physical (heavy, low stamina) or mental (foggy, can\u2019t concentrate)? Does resting or napping help at all, and is the low energy worst in the morning, evening, or all day?\nPatient: Mostly mental \u2014 heavy brain fog, can't concentrate for most of the day. Physical stamina's down too but the fog's worse. Naps help a little then leave me groggy; it's worst in the morning and just lingers, slows my work.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nMostly mental \u2014 heavy brain fog, can't concentrate for most of the day.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: I'm fine. Been tired a lot, sleep's bad and my focus slips sometimes \u2014 a bit indecisive on small stuff, but I'm handling it, not a big deal.\nDoctor: I hear you, Noah \u2014 that sounds really tiring, thanks for sharing. How long have you been feeling like this? Is the tiredness every day or most days? When you say sleep\u2019s bad, is it trouble falling asleep, waking during the night, or waking too early? And are these problems making work or daily responsibilities harder for you?\nPatient: A few months. Tired most days. I can't fall asleep easily and wake up a lot during the night \u2014 sleep's fragmented. It's slowing me down at work, more little mistakes, but I'm managing \u2014 not catastrophic.\nDoctor: I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been so worn down, Noah \u2014 thanks for telling me. I need to ask an important question: have you had any thoughts about death, dying, or hurting yourself?\nPatient: No. I don't have any plan or intent. Sometimes I get brief thoughts about death, but I wouldn't act on them and I'm managing for now.\nDoctor: Thanks, Noah \u2014 I appreciate you being honest. Can I ask: how often do those thoughts come up, have they been getting stronger recently, have you ever tried to hurt yourself before, do you have access to medications, firearms, or anything you could use, and are there people you can turn to right now \u2014 would you be comfortable making a brief safety plan with me if that might help?\nPatient: A few times a month. They\u2019re brief and not getting worse. I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself. No plan or intent. I don\u2019t have access to guns or a big supply of meds. I\u2019ve got a couple people I could contact, though I\u2019d rather not. I\u2019m skeptical a safety plan will help, but I\u2019ll do a brief one if you think it\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: Thanks, Noah \u2014 I appreciate your honesty and that you\u2019ll try this even if you\u2019re skeptical. Can I do a very brief safety plan now? What\u2019s one warning sign you\u2019d notice, one thing you could do to calm yourself in the moment, who would you realistically call first, and just to confirm \u2014 no guns or large supplies of meds at home?\nPatient: When I start obsessing and feel totally hopeless. I'll get up and go for a walk or put on music and breathe. I'd call my friend Alex. No guns or large supplies of meds at home.\nDoctor: I'm glad you have those strategies and someone to call \u2014 thanks, Noah. Have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy \u2014 hobbies, hanging out with friends, or sex \u2014 how long has that been, and is it making day-to-day life harder?\nPatient: Yeah \u2014 a few months. I cancel plans sometimes, hobbies aren\u2019t fun and sex\u2019s less interesting. It\u2019s harder day-to-day \u2014 less motivation, more little mistakes at work \u2014 but I\u2019m still managing, not catastrophic.\nDoctor: Noah, over the past few months have you been feeling worthless, overly guilty, or like a burden to others \u2014 and how often do those feelings come up? Are they getting in the way of your work or relationships? I can see how draining this is.\nPatient: Yeah \u2014 a few times a week I feel worthless or guilty. I pull away, cancel plans, lose motivation; it makes me slower and I make more little mistakes at work and it amps up fights at home. Still managing day-to-day though \u2014 annoying, not catastrophic.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Noah \u2014 quick question: have you felt physically slowed down in your movements or speech, or more restless and fidgety lately? How often does that happen, do other people notice, and is it getting worse or making work or daily tasks harder?\nPatient: No. I\u2019m not physically slowed or more restless. Nobody\u2019s said anything. It\u2019s just fatigue and brain\u2011fog that makes me slower at tasks, not slowed movements or fidgeting.\nDoctor: Thanks, Noah \u2014 one quick question: over the past few months have you noticed any big changes in your appetite or weight (eating much more or much less, or any unintentional weight loss or gain)? If so, about how much and has that change affected your energy or ability to get through the day?\nPatient: No \u2014 no big weight change. I eat less some days, but it's rare and hasn't really affected my energy or functioning.\nDoctor: Noah, have you been feeling sad, empty, or down most days over the past few months? How often\u2014every day or some days\u2014and do those feelings last most of the day or come in brief spells? Is this low mood getting in the way of work or things at home? I know keeping up with work and living with family while feeling this way is really draining.\nPatient: Yeah \u2014 I\u2019ve been down most days for a few months. It lasts most of the day and it\u2019s making work and home harder \u2014 more mistakes, I pull away and fights start. I\u2019m still getting by, just drained.\nDoctor: Noah, that sounds exhausting \u2014 thank you for keeping me posted and for managing as much as you are. Is it okay if we talk briefly about next steps and what help you\u2019d be willing to try (brief therapy, sleep strategies, medication, or other supports), and just to confirm your safety plan \u2014 walking, music, and calling Alex \u2014 is still something you can use if things get worse?\nPatient: Yeah. Walking, music, and calling Alex still work. I'll try sleep strategies and a short, structured therapy trial. I'm skeptical about meds and don't want to start them now. I want practical, short-term steps, not open-ended therapy.\nDoctor: I hear you, Noah \u2014 thanks. About those focus slips and indecisiveness: do they happen every day or only some days, and do they last most of the day or come in short episodes? Are they causing anything beyond little mistakes \u2014 missed deadlines, bigger errors, or trouble finishing tasks?\nPatient: Most days. It lasts much of the day or comes in long spells. I have trouble finishing tasks, make more little mistakes and have missed a few deadlines \u2014 it slows me down and it's annoying, but I'm still managing, not catastrophic.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and draining, Noah \u2014 I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with that. Have those missed deadlines put your job at risk or led to any formal consequences, and how often are you missing them? When you do get stuck, what (if anything) helps you refocus and finish a task, and would you be willing to try brief practical strategies like checklists, chunking tasks, short deadline extensions, or telling a supervisor to reduce errors?\nPatient: I've missed a few deadlines \u2014 no formal discipline yet, my supervisor complained once. Short walks, music, timers and breaking tasks into tiny chunks help; I'll try checklists, chunking and short extensions but I won't tell my supervisor unless I have to.\nDoctor: Good \u2014 those sound like practical steps, Noah. You said you\u2019re tired most days: is it more physical (heavy, low stamina) or mental (foggy, can\u2019t concentrate)? Does resting or napping help at all, and is the low energy worst in the morning, evening, or all day?\nPatient: Mostly mental \u2014 heavy brain fog, can't concentrate for most of the day. Physical stamina's down too but the fog's worse. Naps help a little then leave me groggy; it's worst in the morning and just lingers, slows my work.\nDoctor: Noah, thanks \u2014 that helps. Can you tell me roughly how many hours you get most nights, how long it usually takes you to fall asleep, and how many times you wake and for how long? Do you nap regularly (when and for how long), use caffeine or alcohol late in the day, or notice snoring/gasping at night \u2014 that will help me suggest short, practical sleep steps you might try.\nPatient: About 5\u20136 hours most nights. I take 60\u201390 minutes to fall asleep and wake 2\u20133 times for 10\u201330 minutes \u2014 sleep\u2019s pretty fragmented. I nap some afternoons for 20\u201340 minutes but feel groggy afterward. I drink coffee and sometimes in the late afternoon. No loud snoring or gasping.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
