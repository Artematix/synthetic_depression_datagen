Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

Has it gotten worse compared to how you usually are, and how\u2019s it messing with your daily stuff or schoolwork?\nPatient: It happens pretty often, more than I\u2019d like, and yeah, it\u2019s gotten a bit worse lately. It definitely makes things like studying and even day-to-day stuff harder than they should be, but I\u2019m managing to get by, I guess.\nDoctor: Do you feel tired or low on energy most of the day? And apart from feeling tired, do you have trouble concentrating or making decisions?\nPatient: Yeah, most days I\u2019m pretty tired. Concentrating and deciding things... it\u2019s a struggle more often than not. I just kind of accept that it\u2019s how I am.\nDoctor: You say you manage, but can you give me examples of how this tiredness and trouble focusing mess with your day or mood? Like, what gets harder for you now compared to before?\nPatient: Well, stuff just takes longer, I guess. Things that probably shouldn\u2019t be that hard end up dragging on because my brain feels slow. It\u2019s annoying, but I don\u2019t really have much choice but to deal with it.\nDoctor: How bad is the trouble concentrating and making decisions? Is it something you notice constantly, or does it come and go?\nPatient: It\u2019s pretty often, but not all the time. Mostly it just slows me down and makes stuff frustrating, but I\u2019m still able to get things done\u2014even if it takes longer than it should.\nDoctor: How\u2019s your sleep? Trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s usually okay. Sometimes I have a bit of trouble falling asleep, but nothing too often.\nDoctor: Have you been feeling down, sad, or empty lately? How often does that happen?\nPatient: Not really. If anything, it\u2019s pretty rare. I don\u2019t usually feel like that.\nDoctor: Have you lost interest or stopped enjoying things you used to like?\nPatient: Not really. I guess I just keep doing stuff like usual. Nothing\u2019s really changed there.\nDoctor: Have you been feeling worthless or guilty lately?\nPatient: Not really. I don\u2019t usually think like that.\nDoctor: Any big changes in your appetite or weight recently?\nPatient: There\u2019ve been some small changes, but nothing really major.\nDoctor: Have you noticed if you\u2019re moving or speaking slower than usual, or maybe feeling restless and unable to sit still?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit restless, but most of the time I just end up moving slower or feeling kind of sluggish. It\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s how it\u2019s been.\nDoctor: How often do you feel restless versus sluggish?

What brings you in today?\nPatient: I guess... I\u2019ve just been feeling tired a lot. Like, more than usual, and it\u2019s been messing with my focus when I try to study or work. It\u2019s like my brain doesn\u2019t really keep up sometimes. Not sure if that makes sense.\nDoctor: How often do you feel this tiredness and trouble focusing? Has it gotten worse compared to how you usually are, and how\u2019s it messing with your daily stuff or schoolwork?\nPatient: It happens pretty often, more than I\u2019d like, and yeah, it\u2019s gotten a bit worse lately. It definitely makes things like studying and even day-to-day stuff harder than they should be, but I\u2019m managing to get by, I guess.\nDoctor: Do you feel tired or low on energy most of the day? And apart from feeling tired, do you have trouble concentrating or making decisions?\nPatient: Yeah, most days I\u2019m pretty tired. Concentrating and deciding things... it\u2019s a struggle more often than not. I just kind of accept that it\u2019s how I am.\nDoctor: You say you manage, but can you give me examples of how this tiredness and trouble focusing mess with your day or mood? Like, what gets harder for you now compared to before?\nPatient: Well, stuff just takes longer, I guess. Things that probably shouldn\u2019t be that hard end up dragging on because my brain feels slow. It\u2019s annoying, but I don\u2019t really have much choice but to deal with it.\nDoctor: How bad is the trouble concentrating and making decisions? Is it something you notice constantly, or does it come and go?\nPatient: It\u2019s pretty often, but not all the time. Mostly it just slows me down and makes stuff frustrating, but I\u2019m still able to get things done\u2014even if it takes longer than it should.\nDoctor: How\u2019s your sleep? Trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s usually okay. Sometimes I have a bit of trouble falling asleep, but nothing too often.\nDoctor: Have you been feeling down, sad, or empty lately? How often does that happen?\nPatient: Not really. If anything, it\u2019s pretty rare. I don\u2019t usually feel like that.\nDoctor: Have you lost interest or stopped enjoying things you used to like?\nPatient: Not really. I guess I just keep doing stuff like usual. Nothing\u2019s really changed there.\nDoctor: Have you been feeling worthless or guilty lately?\nPatient: Not really. I don\u2019t usually think like that.\nDoctor: Any big changes in your appetite or weight recently?\nPatient: There\u2019ve been some small changes, but nothing really major.\nDoctor: Have you noticed if you\u2019re moving or speaking slower than usual, or maybe feeling restless and unable to sit still?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit restless, but most of the time I just end up moving slower or feeling kind of sluggish. It\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s how it\u2019s been.\nDoctor: How often do you feel restless versus sluggish? Do these feelings change how you get through your day or affect your mood beyond just feeling tired?\nPatient: Restless feelings are pretty rare. Mostly it\u2019s just that sluggish stuff. It slows things down more than anything else, but I don\u2019t think it messes with my mood much, just makes me more tired.\nDoctor: Have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide recently?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had those thoughts.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
