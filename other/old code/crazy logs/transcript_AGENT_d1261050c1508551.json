I replay conversations all the time and tell myself I said the wrong thing or that I'm becoming a burden to my daughter; those guilty, self-critical thoughts are constant and leave me feeling worthless. Every so often I have trouble concentrating \u2014 there are days when I can't get through a chapter or I can't decide what needs doing first \u2014 and that indecisiveness makes simple tasks take ages. It's getting in the way of my routines and my ability to follow through on things, which only makes me more anxious and hard on myself. I want to be clear I haven't had any thoughts of death or suicide, but I do feel stuck, tired, and worry a lot about being a bother."

At first it was little: mornings felt heavier, I\u2019d replay a conversation and feel ashamed longer than I used to. It wasn\u2019t dramatic at first, but after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that was the turning point \u2014 everything seemed to settle into a lower place and it got steadily worse. Losing that steady role left a lot of empty space and I began to worry I was just becoming useless.\n\nMost days now I feel low; it\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache more than anything explosive. The energy just isn\u2019t there much of the time \u2014 even small tasks feel like more effort than they should. I\u2019m tired a lot, and that makes getting out to do things harder. The self-critical thoughts are almost constant: I go over things I said, imagine I\u2019ve been a burden to my daughter, tell myself I shouldn\u2019t be asking for help. Those guilty feelings sap me, and then I get anxious and hard on myself for not doing more.\n\nMy concentration slips only sometimes \u2014 maybe a few days when I can\u2019t focus long enough to finish a chapter or I faff about deciding what to do first \u2014 but when that happens a simple task can take ages and I feel foolish about it. It\u2019s not every day, but when it comes it\u2019s frustrating and feeds the worry that my memory is slipping.\n\nThere are small things that still help and I cling to them. Tending the vegetable patch and my garden gives me something practical and steady \u2014 even a short time out there helps. Short library shifts, just a couple of hours, make me feel useful again. Reading a paragraph of a book or a poem, or having a quick cup of tea with my daughter or with Marta next door, brightens a moment and reminds me I haven\u2019t lost everything I enjoy. Those small bits don\u2019t fix it, but they make the day bearable sometimes.\n\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I know I sound gloomy \u2014 but I want to be clear: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide.

If I\u2019m sluggish in the morning or I\u2019ve had to stop halfway through a task, the thoughts kick in: \u201cYou\u2019re slowing everyone down,\u201d or \u201cYou can\u2019t even finish this.\u201d When jobs pile up or I have a brief lapse in concentration, it feeds a spiral of anxiety and self\u2011reproach.

Tasks take longer because I stop, berate myself, try again, and then need to rest; it\u2019s a slow, weary cycle.\n\nThose thoughts increase my anxiety and make it harder to be present in things I still enjoy. I can still garden or read a little, and I hold onto those moments, but the joy is dulled because the guilty voice is never far behind telling me I should be doing more. (her voice quavers) It\u2019s humiliating to say, but I worry I\u2019m letting people down, and that worry makes me withdraw a bit and then feel worse about myself.\n\nI know this sounds like a lot.

I\u2019ll start weeding a bed and have to pause after a short spell; I\u2019ll begin shelving at the library and need to sit with a cup of tea before I can carry on. Those breaks are necessary, but they stretch everything out and leave me feeling ashamed and useless afterward.\n\nSince I stepped back from running the book club I withdrew more. I stepped back entirely from that leadership role and cut my library hours down to very short shifts \u2014 I don\u2019t take on the longer volunteer visits anymore and I sometimes say no to social invitations or larger tasks because I worry I won\u2019t manage. I still do small things \u2014 a short gardening stint, a brief library shift, a cup of tea with my daughter \u2014 but they\u2019re shorter and punctuated by rests.

That pattern makes it hard to plan my day; I try to pace myself but the tiredness arrives anyway.\n\nThe worst part is the guilt that comes with resting. As soon as I slow down the running commentary starts \u2014 \u201cyou should be doing more,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re letting people down\u201d \u2014 and that self\u2011criticism makes me anxious and saps what little energy I have left.

When it does happen I feel foolish and guilty about it, and that self\u2011criticism just makes me more sluggish and tired."

It's getting in the way of my routines and my ability to follow through on things, which only makes me more anxious and hard on myself.

      "content": "(her voice a little breathy, a soft sniff) It... it crept up, really \u2014 I suppose I first noticed things changing about a year to a year and a half ago. At first it was little: mornings felt heavier, I\u2019d replay a conversation and feel ashamed longer than I used to. It wasn\u2019t dramatic at first, but after I stepped back from running the book club \u2014 that was the turning point \u2014 everything seemed to settle into a lower place and it got steadily worse. Losing that steady role left a lot of empty space and I began to worry I was just becoming useless.\n\nMost days now I feel low; it\u2019s a quiet, persistent ache more than anything explosive. The energy just isn\u2019t there much of the time \u2014 even small tasks feel like more effort than they should. I\u2019m tired a lot, and that makes getting out to do things harder. The self-critical thoughts are almost constant: I go over things I said, imagine I\u2019ve been a burden to my daughter, tell myself I shouldn\u2019t be asking for help. Those guilty feelings sap me, and then I get anxious and hard on myself for not doing more.\n\nMy concentration slips only sometimes \u2014 maybe a few days when I can\u2019t focus long enough to finish a chapter or I faff about deciding what to do first \u2014 but when that happens a simple task can take ages and I feel foolish about it. It\u2019s not every day, but when it comes it\u2019s frustrating and feeds the worry that my memory is slipping.\n\nThere are small things that still help and I cling to them. Tending the vegetable patch and my garden gives me something practical and steady \u2014 even a short time out there helps. Short library shifts, just a couple of hours, make me feel useful again. Reading a paragraph of a book or a poem, or having a quick cup of tea with my daughter or with Marta next door, brightens a moment and reminds me I haven\u2019t lost everything I enjoy. Those small bits don\u2019t fix it, but they make the day bearable sometimes.\n\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I know I sound gloomy \u2014 but I want to be clear: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide.

Those are the moments when I have time to replay things and the doubts pile up.\n\nI replay conversations all the time \u2014 I\u2019ll go over a chat from the book club or a visit from my daughter and think, \u201cDid I say something stupid? Did I offend them?\u201d Even the smallest remark will loop in my head until I\u2019m convinced I sounded foolish. I keep imagining I\u2019m a burden to my daughter; if she asks to help or checks in, I immediately feel guilty and tell myself I shouldn\u2019t put her out. When I rest \u2014 which I often have to do because I\u2019m tired \u2014 the guilt hits me: I think I should be doing more instead of sitting down, and that makes me hard on myself.\n\nTiredness makes it so much worse. If I\u2019m sluggish in the morning or I\u2019ve had to stop halfway through a task, the thoughts kick in: \u201cYou\u2019re slowing everyone down,\u201d or \u201cYou can\u2019t even finish this.\u201d When jobs pile up or I have a brief lapse in concentration, it feeds a spiral of anxiety and self\u2011reproach. The whole thing is exhausting \u2014 mentally and physically \u2014 and it saps the little energy I have left. Tasks take longer because I stop, berate myself, try again, and then need to rest; it\u2019s a slow, weary cycle.\n\nThose thoughts increase my anxiety and make it harder to be present in things I still enjoy. I can still garden or read a little, and I hold onto those moments, but the joy is dulled because the guilty voice is never far behind telling me I should be doing more. (her voice quavers) It\u2019s humiliating to say, but I worry I\u2019m letting people down, and that worry makes me withdraw a bit and then feel worse about myself.\n\nI know this sounds like a lot. I want to be very clear: I have not had any thoughts of death or suicide.

I\u2019ll start weeding a bed and have to pause after a short spell; I\u2019ll begin shelving at the library and need to sit with a cup of tea before I can carry on. Those breaks are necessary, but they stretch everything out and leave me feeling ashamed and useless afterward.\n\nSince I stepped back from running the book club I withdrew more. I stepped back entirely from that leadership role and cut my library hours down to very short shifts \u2014 I don\u2019t take on the longer volunteer visits anymore and I sometimes say no to social invitations or larger tasks because I worry I won\u2019t manage. I still do small things \u2014 a short gardening stint, a brief library shift, a cup of tea with my daughter \u2014 but they\u2019re shorter and punctuated by rests.

I appreciate the kindness when it happens, but afterwards I feel ashamed that I asked or that I needed anything at all. Sometimes I try to do a little extra for people straight away because it feels like the only way to \u201cpay them back,\u201d which only wears me out more.\n\nThose feelings really get in the way of accepting practical help. If Marta offers to stay and chat while I weed, I\u2019m grateful, but then I\u2019m embarrassed and worry I\u2019m taking advantage; that makes it harder to let her actually help. It\u2019s a tiring cycle \u2014 the guilt reduces my energy, makes me avoid or shorten things, and then I feel worse for not doing more.\n\nI want to be clear again: I have not had any thoughts of death or suicide."

Does this interfere with important things like remembering appointments, taking medication, or managing bills, or is it mostly slowing down everyday tasks?"

Maybe a couple of times a week when I\u2019m especially tired, or sometimes less; usually it\u2019s when I\u2019ve had a poor morning or I\u2019m mid\u2011afternoon and worn out. Typical moments are losing my place in a chapter, faffing about for longer than I should over what to do next, or starting a task and then spending ages deciding how to begin. It slows things down, makes chores and gardening take twice as long, but it hasn\u2019t stopped me from the important stuff \u2014 I still remember my medicines, keep appointments, and manage the bills. When it does happen I feel foolish and guilty about it, and that self\u2011criticism just makes me more sluggish and tired."

I\u2019m really relieved you asked. I do often feel guilty and worry I\u2019m a burden to my daughter, but that\u2019s not the same as wanting to die. If anything ever changed, I would tell you or my daughter right away."
