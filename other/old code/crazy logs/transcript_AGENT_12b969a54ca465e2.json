I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating."

The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps. The kids have pointed out I\u2019m snappier and slower lately, and it definitely gets worse with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.

I used to tinker and finish little projects around the house and I don\u2019t have the drive for that anymore; I read and watch TV less, and I find myself avoiding social visits I\u2019d normally tolerate. \n\nA few things still pull me out of it \u2014 short walks, a strong cup of coffee, the small satisfaction when I finish a task, and the occasional good moment with the kids. The loss of interest makes chores and caregiving take more effort and more time, and I get more irritable and withdrawn, which is starting to strain relationships, but I still complete most of the care tasks. \n\nOverall it\u2019s stayed about the same or a bit worse recently, especially after bad nights of sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating."

The slowed, \u201cmoving through molasses\u201d feeling shows up a few days a week, usually in the mornings after a bad night or when I\u2019m trying to do fine, focused tasks.\n\nTypical pattern is pacing and rumination at night, then the next morning I\u2019m slower and clumsier. For example, pacing nights lead to repeated checking and long wakeful periods that delay my morning routine; on slowed days a simple repair or household job can take twice as long and feel awkward, like I\u2019m fumbling through steps. The kids have pointed out I\u2019m snappier and slower lately, and it definitely gets worse with poor sleep and when I\u2019m ruminating.
