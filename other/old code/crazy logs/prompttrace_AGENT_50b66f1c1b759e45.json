I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nI\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\n\nTask:\nDecide how the patient should respond next and output JSON only.",

The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night.

Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply?

I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess.

Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988.

Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply?

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start.

Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha.

Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back.

If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave.

The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave. I\u2019ll send the exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988, and it\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t reply right away. Please lean on Riley or Aisha tonight, and if you feel unsafe at any point call 988, your local crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency department.\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 I appreciate the support and the check\u2011in. That text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988 included is fine. I\u2019ll lean on Riley tonight with the phone held and Aisha as my backup; I may not reply right away in the morning but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ll check in. If I start to feel unsafe I will call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this \u2014 that took courage.

I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave. I\u2019ll send the exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988, and it\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t reply right away. Please lean on Riley or Aisha tonight, and if you feel unsafe at any point call 988, your local crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency department.\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 I appreciate the support and the check\u2011in. That text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988 included is fine. I\u2019ll lean on Riley tonight with the phone held and Aisha as my backup; I may not reply right away in the morning but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ll check in. If I start to feel unsafe I will call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this \u2014 that took courage. Over the past two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating, finishing tasks, or making decisions (for example with schoolwork, sketching, or art\u2011school things)? Can you share a couple concrete examples, how often it\u2019s been happening, and whether it\u2019s getting in the way of day\u2011to\u2011day functioning?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 over the past two weeks I\u2019ve noticed trouble concentrating and making decisions, but it\u2019s intermittent rather than constant. It comes up several times a week, and it\u2019s definitely worse when I\u2019m tired, stressed, or caught up in comparing portfolios late at night while I\u2019m scrolling.\n\nConcrete examples: I missed an early art\u2011school deadline right after the move because I kept putting off finishing and submitting the pieces. I\u2019m procrastinating on portfolio edits more than I used to \u2014 a task that used to take an afternoon stretches into days. Picking which works to include takes me much longer now; I\u2019ll sit with the same six pieces and be unable to decide the order or which to cut, and small technical choices feel magnified and exhausting.\n\nDaytime functioning is largely intact \u2014 I\u2019m going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping my sketching hour most nights \u2014 but these lapses slow me down, lower the energy and quality of my work, and undermine momentum.

I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave. I\u2019ll send the exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988, and it\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t reply right away. Please lean on Riley or Aisha tonight, and if you feel unsafe at any point call 988, your local crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency department.\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 I appreciate the support and the check\u2011in. That text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988 included is fine. I\u2019ll lean on Riley tonight with the phone held and Aisha as my backup; I may not reply right away in the morning but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ll check in. If I start to feel unsafe I will call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this \u2014 that took courage. Over the past two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating, finishing tasks, or making decisions (for example with schoolwork, sketching, or art\u2011school things)? Can you share a couple concrete examples, how often it\u2019s been happening, and whether it\u2019s getting in the way of day\u2011to\u2011day functioning?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 over the past two weeks I\u2019ve noticed trouble concentrating and making decisions, but it\u2019s intermittent rather than constant. It comes up several times a week, and it\u2019s definitely worse when I\u2019m tired, stressed, or caught up in comparing portfolios late at night while I\u2019m scrolling.\n\nConcrete examples: I missed an early art\u2011school deadline right after the move because I kept putting off finishing and submitting the pieces. I\u2019m procrastinating on portfolio edits more than I used to \u2014 a task that used to take an afternoon stretches into days. Picking which works to include takes me much longer now; I\u2019ll sit with the same six pieces and be unable to decide the order or which to cut, and small technical choices feel magnified and exhausting.\n\nDaytime functioning is largely intact \u2014 I\u2019m going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping my sketching hour most nights \u2014 but these lapses slow me down, lower the energy and quality of my work, and undermine momentum. It\u2019s frustrating because I can do the tasks in principle, but the extra time and indecision are making progress feel much harder than it should be.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and tiring, Maya. Over the past two weeks, have you felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 and how often (daily, several times a week)? Please give a couple concrete examples of how that low energy gets in the way of school, your caf\u00e9 shifts, or sketching; does rest or caffeine help at all, is it worse in the morning or evening, and on a scale from 0\u201310 how severe would you rate your typical energy loss?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat sounds really frustrating and tiring, Maya.

      "output": "I haven\u2019t felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 energy loss isn\u2019t a major problem for me right now. Daytime functioning is pretty intact: I\u2019m keeping up with school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping a nightly sketching habit most evenings. The main issue is these evening dips after poor sleep and rumination; when I\u2019m up late scrolling I get mentally drained and even a simple portfolio edit will drag on for hours. For example, picking and sequencing pieces that used to take me an afternoon now stretches over several nights, and an editing session that should be brisk becomes slow and fiddly once I\u2019m tired. Caffeine in the morning helps me feel alert for classes and shifts, and a short rest or a five\u2011minute sketch can reset me enough to keep going, but those things don\u2019t eliminate how vulnerable I feel at night. Overall I\u2019d rate typical energy loss about a 1 out of 10 \u2014 it\u2019s low most days, with the exception of those worse evenings."

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave. I\u2019ll send the exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988, and it\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t reply right away. Please lean on Riley or Aisha tonight, and if you feel unsafe at any point call 988, your local crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency department.\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 I appreciate the support and the check\u2011in. That text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988 included is fine. I\u2019ll lean on Riley tonight with the phone held and Aisha as my backup; I may not reply right away in the morning but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ll check in. If I start to feel unsafe I will call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this \u2014 that took courage. Over the past two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating, finishing tasks, or making decisions (for example with schoolwork, sketching, or art\u2011school things)? Can you share a couple concrete examples, how often it\u2019s been happening, and whether it\u2019s getting in the way of day\u2011to\u2011day functioning?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 over the past two weeks I\u2019ve noticed trouble concentrating and making decisions, but it\u2019s intermittent rather than constant. It comes up several times a week, and it\u2019s definitely worse when I\u2019m tired, stressed, or caught up in comparing portfolios late at night while I\u2019m scrolling.\n\nConcrete examples: I missed an early art\u2011school deadline right after the move because I kept putting off finishing and submitting the pieces. I\u2019m procrastinating on portfolio edits more than I used to \u2014 a task that used to take an afternoon stretches into days. Picking which works to include takes me much longer now; I\u2019ll sit with the same six pieces and be unable to decide the order or which to cut, and small technical choices feel magnified and exhausting.\n\nDaytime functioning is largely intact \u2014 I\u2019m going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping my sketching hour most nights \u2014 but these lapses slow me down, lower the energy and quality of my work, and undermine momentum. It\u2019s frustrating because I can do the tasks in principle, but the extra time and indecision are making progress feel much harder than it should be.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and tiring, Maya. Over the past two weeks, have you felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 and how often (daily, several times a week)? Please give a couple concrete examples of how that low energy gets in the way of school, your caf\u00e9 shifts, or sketching; does rest or caffeine help at all, is it worse in the morning or evening, and on a scale from 0\u201310 how severe would you rate your typical energy loss?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 energy loss isn\u2019t a major problem for me right now. Daytime functioning is pretty intact: I\u2019m keeping up with school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping a nightly sketching habit most evenings. The main issue is these evening dips after poor sleep and rumination; when I\u2019m up late scrolling I get mentally drained and even a simple portfolio edit will drag on for hours. For example, picking and sequencing pieces that used to take me an afternoon now stretches over several nights, and an editing session that should be brisk becomes slow and fiddly once I\u2019m tired. Caffeine in the morning helps me feel alert for classes and shifts, and a short rest or a five\u2011minute sketch can reset me enough to keep going, but those things don\u2019t eliminate how vulnerable I feel at night. Overall I\u2019d rate typical energy loss about a 1 out of 10 \u2014 it\u2019s low most days, with the exception of those worse evenings.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nI haven\u2019t felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 energy loss isn\u2019t a major problem for me right now.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave. I\u2019ll send the exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988, and it\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t reply right away. Please lean on Riley or Aisha tonight, and if you feel unsafe at any point call 988, your local crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency department.\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 I appreciate the support and the check\u2011in. That text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988 included is fine. I\u2019ll lean on Riley tonight with the phone held and Aisha as my backup; I may not reply right away in the morning but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ll check in. If I start to feel unsafe I will call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this \u2014 that took courage. Over the past two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating, finishing tasks, or making decisions (for example with schoolwork, sketching, or art\u2011school things)? Can you share a couple concrete examples, how often it\u2019s been happening, and whether it\u2019s getting in the way of day\u2011to\u2011day functioning?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 over the past two weeks I\u2019ve noticed trouble concentrating and making decisions, but it\u2019s intermittent rather than constant. It comes up several times a week, and it\u2019s definitely worse when I\u2019m tired, stressed, or caught up in comparing portfolios late at night while I\u2019m scrolling.\n\nConcrete examples: I missed an early art\u2011school deadline right after the move because I kept putting off finishing and submitting the pieces. I\u2019m procrastinating on portfolio edits more than I used to \u2014 a task that used to take an afternoon stretches into days. Picking which works to include takes me much longer now; I\u2019ll sit with the same six pieces and be unable to decide the order or which to cut, and small technical choices feel magnified and exhausting.\n\nDaytime functioning is largely intact \u2014 I\u2019m going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping my sketching hour most nights \u2014 but these lapses slow me down, lower the energy and quality of my work, and undermine momentum. It\u2019s frustrating because I can do the tasks in principle, but the extra time and indecision are making progress feel much harder than it should be.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and tiring, Maya. Over the past two weeks, have you felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 and how often (daily, several times a week)? Please give a couple concrete examples of how that low energy gets in the way of school, your caf\u00e9 shifts, or sketching; does rest or caffeine help at all, is it worse in the morning or evening, and on a scale from 0\u201310 how severe would you rate your typical energy loss?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 energy loss isn\u2019t a major problem for me right now. Daytime functioning is pretty intact: I\u2019m keeping up with school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping a nightly sketching habit most evenings. The main issue is these evening dips after poor sleep and rumination; when I\u2019m up late scrolling I get mentally drained and even a simple portfolio edit will drag on for hours. For example, picking and sequencing pieces that used to take me an afternoon now stretches over several nights, and an editing session that should be brisk becomes slow and fiddly once I\u2019m tired. Caffeine in the morning helps me feel alert for classes and shifts, and a short rest or a five\u2011minute sketch can reset me enough to keep going, but those things don\u2019t eliminate how vulnerable I feel at night. Overall I\u2019d rate typical energy loss about a 1 out of 10 \u2014 it\u2019s low most days, with the exception of those worse evenings.\nDoctor: Maya, thanks \u2014 that makes sense and I hear how evenings are the hardest. Lately have you been feeling unusually guilty or like you\u2019re a failure (for example blaming yourself for the missed deadline or for comparing yourself to others)? How often do those thoughts come up, can you give a couple concrete examples, do they get in the way of your day\u2011to\u2011day life, and how strong would you rate those feelings on a 0\u201310 scale?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nMaya, thanks \u2014 that makes sense and I hear how evenings are the hardest.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave. I\u2019ll send the exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988, and it\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t reply right away. Please lean on Riley or Aisha tonight, and if you feel unsafe at any point call 988, your local crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency department.\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 I appreciate the support and the check\u2011in. That text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988 included is fine. I\u2019ll lean on Riley tonight with the phone held and Aisha as my backup; I may not reply right away in the morning but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ll check in. If I start to feel unsafe I will call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this \u2014 that took courage. Over the past two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating, finishing tasks, or making decisions (for example with schoolwork, sketching, or art\u2011school things)? Can you share a couple concrete examples, how often it\u2019s been happening, and whether it\u2019s getting in the way of day\u2011to\u2011day functioning?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 over the past two weeks I\u2019ve noticed trouble concentrating and making decisions, but it\u2019s intermittent rather than constant. It comes up several times a week, and it\u2019s definitely worse when I\u2019m tired, stressed, or caught up in comparing portfolios late at night while I\u2019m scrolling.\n\nConcrete examples: I missed an early art\u2011school deadline right after the move because I kept putting off finishing and submitting the pieces. I\u2019m procrastinating on portfolio edits more than I used to \u2014 a task that used to take an afternoon stretches into days. Picking which works to include takes me much longer now; I\u2019ll sit with the same six pieces and be unable to decide the order or which to cut, and small technical choices feel magnified and exhausting.\n\nDaytime functioning is largely intact \u2014 I\u2019m going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping my sketching hour most nights \u2014 but these lapses slow me down, lower the energy and quality of my work, and undermine momentum. It\u2019s frustrating because I can do the tasks in principle, but the extra time and indecision are making progress feel much harder than it should be.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and tiring, Maya. Over the past two weeks, have you felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 and how often (daily, several times a week)? Please give a couple concrete examples of how that low energy gets in the way of school, your caf\u00e9 shifts, or sketching; does rest or caffeine help at all, is it worse in the morning or evening, and on a scale from 0\u201310 how severe would you rate your typical energy loss?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 energy loss isn\u2019t a major problem for me right now. Daytime functioning is pretty intact: I\u2019m keeping up with school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping a nightly sketching habit most evenings. The main issue is these evening dips after poor sleep and rumination; when I\u2019m up late scrolling I get mentally drained and even a simple portfolio edit will drag on for hours. For example, picking and sequencing pieces that used to take me an afternoon now stretches over several nights, and an editing session that should be brisk becomes slow and fiddly once I\u2019m tired. Caffeine in the morning helps me feel alert for classes and shifts, and a short rest or a five\u2011minute sketch can reset me enough to keep going, but those things don\u2019t eliminate how vulnerable I feel at night. Overall I\u2019d rate typical energy loss about a 1 out of 10 \u2014 it\u2019s low most days, with the exception of those worse evenings.\nDoctor: Maya, thanks \u2014 that makes sense and I hear how evenings are the hardest. Lately have you been feeling unusually guilty or like you\u2019re a failure (for example blaming yourself for the missed deadline or for comparing yourself to others)? How often do those thoughts come up, can you give a couple concrete examples, do they get in the way of your day\u2011to\u2011day life, and how strong would you rate those feelings on a 0\u201310 scale?\nPatient: I don\u2019t feel unusually guilty or like a failure overall. Mostly it\u2019s occasional frustration or mild self\u2011reproach \u2014 a few times a week at most \u2014 and it\u2019s usually tied to evenings when I\u2019m tired or ruminating. For example, I\u2019ll blame myself briefly for missing that early art\u2011school deadline after the move, or get annoyed at myself for procrastinating on portfolio edits. Another example is feeling discouraged when I compare my work to others online and wonder if I\u2019ve already fallen behind.\n\nThose thoughts are irritating and they slow me down and sap motivation, but they don\u2019t stop me from going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, or keeping up my sketching routine. On a 0\u201310 scale I\u2019d put that feeling around a 1 out of 10 \u2014 present sometimes, but pretty mild and not pervasive.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nI don\u2019t feel unusually guilty or like a failure overall.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave. I\u2019ll send the exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988, and it\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t reply right away. Please lean on Riley or Aisha tonight, and if you feel unsafe at any point call 988, your local crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency department.\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 I appreciate the support and the check\u2011in. That text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988 included is fine. I\u2019ll lean on Riley tonight with the phone held and Aisha as my backup; I may not reply right away in the morning but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ll check in. If I start to feel unsafe I will call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this \u2014 that took courage. Over the past two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating, finishing tasks, or making decisions (for example with schoolwork, sketching, or art\u2011school things)? Can you share a couple concrete examples, how often it\u2019s been happening, and whether it\u2019s getting in the way of day\u2011to\u2011day functioning?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 over the past two weeks I\u2019ve noticed trouble concentrating and making decisions, but it\u2019s intermittent rather than constant. It comes up several times a week, and it\u2019s definitely worse when I\u2019m tired, stressed, or caught up in comparing portfolios late at night while I\u2019m scrolling.\n\nConcrete examples: I missed an early art\u2011school deadline right after the move because I kept putting off finishing and submitting the pieces. I\u2019m procrastinating on portfolio edits more than I used to \u2014 a task that used to take an afternoon stretches into days. Picking which works to include takes me much longer now; I\u2019ll sit with the same six pieces and be unable to decide the order or which to cut, and small technical choices feel magnified and exhausting.\n\nDaytime functioning is largely intact \u2014 I\u2019m going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping my sketching hour most nights \u2014 but these lapses slow me down, lower the energy and quality of my work, and undermine momentum. It\u2019s frustrating because I can do the tasks in principle, but the extra time and indecision are making progress feel much harder than it should be.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and tiring, Maya. Over the past two weeks, have you felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 and how often (daily, several times a week)? Please give a couple concrete examples of how that low energy gets in the way of school, your caf\u00e9 shifts, or sketching; does rest or caffeine help at all, is it worse in the morning or evening, and on a scale from 0\u201310 how severe would you rate your typical energy loss?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 energy loss isn\u2019t a major problem for me right now. Daytime functioning is pretty intact: I\u2019m keeping up with school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping a nightly sketching habit most evenings. The main issue is these evening dips after poor sleep and rumination; when I\u2019m up late scrolling I get mentally drained and even a simple portfolio edit will drag on for hours. For example, picking and sequencing pieces that used to take me an afternoon now stretches over several nights, and an editing session that should be brisk becomes slow and fiddly once I\u2019m tired. Caffeine in the morning helps me feel alert for classes and shifts, and a short rest or a five\u2011minute sketch can reset me enough to keep going, but those things don\u2019t eliminate how vulnerable I feel at night. Overall I\u2019d rate typical energy loss about a 1 out of 10 \u2014 it\u2019s low most days, with the exception of those worse evenings.\nDoctor: Maya, thanks \u2014 that makes sense and I hear how evenings are the hardest. Lately have you been feeling unusually guilty or like you\u2019re a failure (for example blaming yourself for the missed deadline or for comparing yourself to others)? How often do those thoughts come up, can you give a couple concrete examples, do they get in the way of your day\u2011to\u2011day life, and how strong would you rate those feelings on a 0\u201310 scale?\nPatient: I don\u2019t feel unusually guilty or like a failure overall. Mostly it\u2019s occasional frustration or mild self\u2011reproach \u2014 a few times a week at most \u2014 and it\u2019s usually tied to evenings when I\u2019m tired or ruminating. For example, I\u2019ll blame myself briefly for missing that early art\u2011school deadline after the move, or get annoyed at myself for procrastinating on portfolio edits. Another example is feeling discouraged when I compare my work to others online and wonder if I\u2019ve already fallen behind.\n\nThose thoughts are irritating and they slow me down and sap motivation, but they don\u2019t stop me from going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, or keeping up my sketching routine. On a 0\u201310 scale I\u2019d put that feeling around a 1 out of 10 \u2014 present sometimes, but pretty mild and not pervasive.\nDoctor: Thank you \u2014 that\u2019s helpful to hear. Over the past two weeks, have you noticed being physically slowed down (moving, speaking, or thinking more slowly) or, on the other hand, feeling more fidgety or restless and unable to sit still? If so, can you give one or two concrete examples, say how often it happens, and whether roommates, classmates, or coworkers have noticed or it\u2019s gotten in the way of school or your caf\u00e9 shifts? Take your time.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThank you \u2014 that\u2019s helpful to hear.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave. I\u2019ll send the exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988, and it\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t reply right away. Please lean on Riley or Aisha tonight, and if you feel unsafe at any point call 988, your local crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency department.\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 I appreciate the support and the check\u2011in. That text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988 included is fine. I\u2019ll lean on Riley tonight with the phone held and Aisha as my backup; I may not reply right away in the morning but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ll check in. If I start to feel unsafe I will call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this \u2014 that took courage. Over the past two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating, finishing tasks, or making decisions (for example with schoolwork, sketching, or art\u2011school things)? Can you share a couple concrete examples, how often it\u2019s been happening, and whether it\u2019s getting in the way of day\u2011to\u2011day functioning?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 over the past two weeks I\u2019ve noticed trouble concentrating and making decisions, but it\u2019s intermittent rather than constant. It comes up several times a week, and it\u2019s definitely worse when I\u2019m tired, stressed, or caught up in comparing portfolios late at night while I\u2019m scrolling.\n\nConcrete examples: I missed an early art\u2011school deadline right after the move because I kept putting off finishing and submitting the pieces. I\u2019m procrastinating on portfolio edits more than I used to \u2014 a task that used to take an afternoon stretches into days. Picking which works to include takes me much longer now; I\u2019ll sit with the same six pieces and be unable to decide the order or which to cut, and small technical choices feel magnified and exhausting.\n\nDaytime functioning is largely intact \u2014 I\u2019m going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping my sketching hour most nights \u2014 but these lapses slow me down, lower the energy and quality of my work, and undermine momentum. It\u2019s frustrating because I can do the tasks in principle, but the extra time and indecision are making progress feel much harder than it should be.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and tiring, Maya. Over the past two weeks, have you felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 and how often (daily, several times a week)? Please give a couple concrete examples of how that low energy gets in the way of school, your caf\u00e9 shifts, or sketching; does rest or caffeine help at all, is it worse in the morning or evening, and on a scale from 0\u201310 how severe would you rate your typical energy loss?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 energy loss isn\u2019t a major problem for me right now. Daytime functioning is pretty intact: I\u2019m keeping up with school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping a nightly sketching habit most evenings. The main issue is these evening dips after poor sleep and rumination; when I\u2019m up late scrolling I get mentally drained and even a simple portfolio edit will drag on for hours. For example, picking and sequencing pieces that used to take me an afternoon now stretches over several nights, and an editing session that should be brisk becomes slow and fiddly once I\u2019m tired. Caffeine in the morning helps me feel alert for classes and shifts, and a short rest or a five\u2011minute sketch can reset me enough to keep going, but those things don\u2019t eliminate how vulnerable I feel at night. Overall I\u2019d rate typical energy loss about a 1 out of 10 \u2014 it\u2019s low most days, with the exception of those worse evenings.\nDoctor: Maya, thanks \u2014 that makes sense and I hear how evenings are the hardest. Lately have you been feeling unusually guilty or like you\u2019re a failure (for example blaming yourself for the missed deadline or for comparing yourself to others)? How often do those thoughts come up, can you give a couple concrete examples, do they get in the way of your day\u2011to\u2011day life, and how strong would you rate those feelings on a 0\u201310 scale?\nPatient: I don\u2019t feel unusually guilty or like a failure overall. Mostly it\u2019s occasional frustration or mild self\u2011reproach \u2014 a few times a week at most \u2014 and it\u2019s usually tied to evenings when I\u2019m tired or ruminating. For example, I\u2019ll blame myself briefly for missing that early art\u2011school deadline after the move, or get annoyed at myself for procrastinating on portfolio edits. Another example is feeling discouraged when I compare my work to others online and wonder if I\u2019ve already fallen behind.\n\nThose thoughts are irritating and they slow me down and sap motivation, but they don\u2019t stop me from going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, or keeping up my sketching routine. On a 0\u201310 scale I\u2019d put that feeling around a 1 out of 10 \u2014 present sometimes, but pretty mild and not pervasive.\nDoctor: Thank you \u2014 that\u2019s helpful to hear. Over the past two weeks, have you noticed being physically slowed down (moving, speaking, or thinking more slowly) or, on the other hand, feeling more fidgety or restless and unable to sit still? If so, can you give one or two concrete examples, say how often it happens, and whether roommates, classmates, or coworkers have noticed or it\u2019s gotten in the way of school or your caf\u00e9 shifts? Take your time.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t been noticeably slowed down during the day \u2014 I move and speak about the same and my thinking feels clear enough to get through classes and shifts. What I do notice is situational restlessness at night when I\u2019m up ruminating: a few nights a week I\u2019ll pace around the apartment, bounce my leg, or keep picking at something on the table and tapping it as a way to burn off the restless energy. Sometimes I feel a little mentally foggy the next morning after a really bad night of sleep and rumination, but that\u2019s pretty uncommon.\n\nMy roommates, classmates, and coworkers haven\u2019t really commented on any of this, and it hasn\u2019t meaningfully interfered with school or my caf\u00e9 shifts. It\u2019s mostly an evening thing that makes the nights feel longer and makes focusing on portfolio work harder.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nI haven\u2019t been noticeably slowed down during the day \u2014 I move and speak about the same and my thinking feels clear enough to get through classes and shifts.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave. I\u2019ll send the exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988, and it\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t reply right away. Please lean on Riley or Aisha tonight, and if you feel unsafe at any point call 988, your local crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency department.\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 I appreciate the support and the check\u2011in. That text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988 included is fine. I\u2019ll lean on Riley tonight with the phone held and Aisha as my backup; I may not reply right away in the morning but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ll check in. If I start to feel unsafe I will call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this \u2014 that took courage. Over the past two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating, finishing tasks, or making decisions (for example with schoolwork, sketching, or art\u2011school things)? Can you share a couple concrete examples, how often it\u2019s been happening, and whether it\u2019s getting in the way of day\u2011to\u2011day functioning?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 over the past two weeks I\u2019ve noticed trouble concentrating and making decisions, but it\u2019s intermittent rather than constant. It comes up several times a week, and it\u2019s definitely worse when I\u2019m tired, stressed, or caught up in comparing portfolios late at night while I\u2019m scrolling.\n\nConcrete examples: I missed an early art\u2011school deadline right after the move because I kept putting off finishing and submitting the pieces. I\u2019m procrastinating on portfolio edits more than I used to \u2014 a task that used to take an afternoon stretches into days. Picking which works to include takes me much longer now; I\u2019ll sit with the same six pieces and be unable to decide the order or which to cut, and small technical choices feel magnified and exhausting.\n\nDaytime functioning is largely intact \u2014 I\u2019m going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping my sketching hour most nights \u2014 but these lapses slow me down, lower the energy and quality of my work, and undermine momentum. It\u2019s frustrating because I can do the tasks in principle, but the extra time and indecision are making progress feel much harder than it should be.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and tiring, Maya. Over the past two weeks, have you felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 and how often (daily, several times a week)? Please give a couple concrete examples of how that low energy gets in the way of school, your caf\u00e9 shifts, or sketching; does rest or caffeine help at all, is it worse in the morning or evening, and on a scale from 0\u201310 how severe would you rate your typical energy loss?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 energy loss isn\u2019t a major problem for me right now. Daytime functioning is pretty intact: I\u2019m keeping up with school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping a nightly sketching habit most evenings. The main issue is these evening dips after poor sleep and rumination; when I\u2019m up late scrolling I get mentally drained and even a simple portfolio edit will drag on for hours. For example, picking and sequencing pieces that used to take me an afternoon now stretches over several nights, and an editing session that should be brisk becomes slow and fiddly once I\u2019m tired. Caffeine in the morning helps me feel alert for classes and shifts, and a short rest or a five\u2011minute sketch can reset me enough to keep going, but those things don\u2019t eliminate how vulnerable I feel at night. Overall I\u2019d rate typical energy loss about a 1 out of 10 \u2014 it\u2019s low most days, with the exception of those worse evenings.\nDoctor: Maya, thanks \u2014 that makes sense and I hear how evenings are the hardest. Lately have you been feeling unusually guilty or like you\u2019re a failure (for example blaming yourself for the missed deadline or for comparing yourself to others)? How often do those thoughts come up, can you give a couple concrete examples, do they get in the way of your day\u2011to\u2011day life, and how strong would you rate those feelings on a 0\u201310 scale?\nPatient: I don\u2019t feel unusually guilty or like a failure overall. Mostly it\u2019s occasional frustration or mild self\u2011reproach \u2014 a few times a week at most \u2014 and it\u2019s usually tied to evenings when I\u2019m tired or ruminating. For example, I\u2019ll blame myself briefly for missing that early art\u2011school deadline after the move, or get annoyed at myself for procrastinating on portfolio edits. Another example is feeling discouraged when I compare my work to others online and wonder if I\u2019ve already fallen behind.\n\nThose thoughts are irritating and they slow me down and sap motivation, but they don\u2019t stop me from going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, or keeping up my sketching routine. On a 0\u201310 scale I\u2019d put that feeling around a 1 out of 10 \u2014 present sometimes, but pretty mild and not pervasive.\nDoctor: Thank you \u2014 that\u2019s helpful to hear. Over the past two weeks, have you noticed being physically slowed down (moving, speaking, or thinking more slowly) or, on the other hand, feeling more fidgety or restless and unable to sit still? If so, can you give one or two concrete examples, say how often it happens, and whether roommates, classmates, or coworkers have noticed or it\u2019s gotten in the way of school or your caf\u00e9 shifts? Take your time.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t been noticeably slowed down during the day \u2014 I move and speak about the same and my thinking feels clear enough to get through classes and shifts. What I do notice is situational restlessness at night when I\u2019m up ruminating: a few nights a week I\u2019ll pace around the apartment, bounce my leg, or keep picking at something on the table and tapping it as a way to burn off the restless energy. Sometimes I feel a little mentally foggy the next morning after a really bad night of sleep and rumination, but that\u2019s pretty uncommon.\n\nMy roommates, classmates, and coworkers haven\u2019t really commented on any of this, and it hasn\u2019t meaningfully interfered with school or my caf\u00e9 shifts. It\u2019s mostly an evening thing that makes the nights feel longer and makes focusing on portfolio work harder.\nDoctor: I\u2019m sorry nights have been so rough, Maya \u2014 that sounds exhausting. Can you tell me: how long does it usually take you to fall asleep, do you have trouble staying asleep or wake up early, and roughly how many hours do you get most nights and how many nights per week this happens; do the ruminating thoughts keep you from falling asleep or wake you up, do you nap or use caffeine or any sleep aids, when did this pattern start, and how non\u2011restorative does your sleep feel \u2014 and if you like, I can go over some practical nighttime strategies after you describe it.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nI\u2019m sorry nights have been so rough, Maya \u2014 that sounds exhausting.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave. I\u2019ll send the exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988, and it\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t reply right away. Please lean on Riley or Aisha tonight, and if you feel unsafe at any point call 988, your local crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency department.\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 I appreciate the support and the check\u2011in. That text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988 included is fine. I\u2019ll lean on Riley tonight with the phone held and Aisha as my backup; I may not reply right away in the morning but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ll check in. If I start to feel unsafe I will call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this \u2014 that took courage. Over the past two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating, finishing tasks, or making decisions (for example with schoolwork, sketching, or art\u2011school things)? Can you share a couple concrete examples, how often it\u2019s been happening, and whether it\u2019s getting in the way of day\u2011to\u2011day functioning?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 over the past two weeks I\u2019ve noticed trouble concentrating and making decisions, but it\u2019s intermittent rather than constant. It comes up several times a week, and it\u2019s definitely worse when I\u2019m tired, stressed, or caught up in comparing portfolios late at night while I\u2019m scrolling.\n\nConcrete examples: I missed an early art\u2011school deadline right after the move because I kept putting off finishing and submitting the pieces. I\u2019m procrastinating on portfolio edits more than I used to \u2014 a task that used to take an afternoon stretches into days. Picking which works to include takes me much longer now; I\u2019ll sit with the same six pieces and be unable to decide the order or which to cut, and small technical choices feel magnified and exhausting.\n\nDaytime functioning is largely intact \u2014 I\u2019m going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping my sketching hour most nights \u2014 but these lapses slow me down, lower the energy and quality of my work, and undermine momentum. It\u2019s frustrating because I can do the tasks in principle, but the extra time and indecision are making progress feel much harder than it should be.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and tiring, Maya. Over the past two weeks, have you felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 and how often (daily, several times a week)? Please give a couple concrete examples of how that low energy gets in the way of school, your caf\u00e9 shifts, or sketching; does rest or caffeine help at all, is it worse in the morning or evening, and on a scale from 0\u201310 how severe would you rate your typical energy loss?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 energy loss isn\u2019t a major problem for me right now. Daytime functioning is pretty intact: I\u2019m keeping up with school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping a nightly sketching habit most evenings. The main issue is these evening dips after poor sleep and rumination; when I\u2019m up late scrolling I get mentally drained and even a simple portfolio edit will drag on for hours. For example, picking and sequencing pieces that used to take me an afternoon now stretches over several nights, and an editing session that should be brisk becomes slow and fiddly once I\u2019m tired. Caffeine in the morning helps me feel alert for classes and shifts, and a short rest or a five\u2011minute sketch can reset me enough to keep going, but those things don\u2019t eliminate how vulnerable I feel at night. Overall I\u2019d rate typical energy loss about a 1 out of 10 \u2014 it\u2019s low most days, with the exception of those worse evenings.\nDoctor: Maya, thanks \u2014 that makes sense and I hear how evenings are the hardest. Lately have you been feeling unusually guilty or like you\u2019re a failure (for example blaming yourself for the missed deadline or for comparing yourself to others)? How often do those thoughts come up, can you give a couple concrete examples, do they get in the way of your day\u2011to\u2011day life, and how strong would you rate those feelings on a 0\u201310 scale?\nPatient: I don\u2019t feel unusually guilty or like a failure overall. Mostly it\u2019s occasional frustration or mild self\u2011reproach \u2014 a few times a week at most \u2014 and it\u2019s usually tied to evenings when I\u2019m tired or ruminating. For example, I\u2019ll blame myself briefly for missing that early art\u2011school deadline after the move, or get annoyed at myself for procrastinating on portfolio edits. Another example is feeling discouraged when I compare my work to others online and wonder if I\u2019ve already fallen behind.\n\nThose thoughts are irritating and they slow me down and sap motivation, but they don\u2019t stop me from going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, or keeping up my sketching routine. On a 0\u201310 scale I\u2019d put that feeling around a 1 out of 10 \u2014 present sometimes, but pretty mild and not pervasive.\nDoctor: Thank you \u2014 that\u2019s helpful to hear. Over the past two weeks, have you noticed being physically slowed down (moving, speaking, or thinking more slowly) or, on the other hand, feeling more fidgety or restless and unable to sit still? If so, can you give one or two concrete examples, say how often it happens, and whether roommates, classmates, or coworkers have noticed or it\u2019s gotten in the way of school or your caf\u00e9 shifts? Take your time.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t been noticeably slowed down during the day \u2014 I move and speak about the same and my thinking feels clear enough to get through classes and shifts. What I do notice is situational restlessness at night when I\u2019m up ruminating: a few nights a week I\u2019ll pace around the apartment, bounce my leg, or keep picking at something on the table and tapping it as a way to burn off the restless energy. Sometimes I feel a little mentally foggy the next morning after a really bad night of sleep and rumination, but that\u2019s pretty uncommon.\n\nMy roommates, classmates, and coworkers haven\u2019t really commented on any of this, and it hasn\u2019t meaningfully interfered with school or my caf\u00e9 shifts. It\u2019s mostly an evening thing that makes the nights feel longer and makes focusing on portfolio work harder.\nDoctor: I\u2019m sorry nights have been so rough, Maya \u2014 that sounds exhausting. Can you tell me: how long does it usually take you to fall asleep, do you have trouble staying asleep or wake up early, and roughly how many hours do you get most nights and how many nights per week this happens; do the ruminating thoughts keep you from falling asleep or wake you up, do you nap or use caffeine or any sleep aids, when did this pattern start, and how non\u2011restorative does your sleep feel \u2014 and if you like, I can go over some practical nighttime strategies after you describe it.\nPatient: Usually it takes me about an hour to two hours to fall asleep once I try to go to bed. I wake up several times most nights \u2014 typically two to four awakenings \u2014 and more often than not I end up scrolling when I wake, which drags the night out. I\u2019m getting roughly four to six hours total on most nights, about five to six nights a week. The rumination is the main problem: those looping thoughts keep me from falling asleep and then pull me awake during the night. I don\u2019t nap regularly, and I only use caffeine in the morning which helps for classes and shifts; I don\u2019t take prescription sleep aids. This pattern has gotten worse over the last few months since the move and missing deadlines. Sleep feels non\u2011restorative \u2014 mornings are usually okay, but after a really bad night I\u2019ll feel foggy and slower. I\u2019m open to trying practical nighttime strategies and would like concrete suggestions I can actually do.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nUsually it takes me about an hour to two hours to fall asleep once I try to go to bed.

I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave. I\u2019ll send the exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988, and it\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t reply right away. Please lean on Riley or Aisha tonight, and if you feel unsafe at any point call 988, your local crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency department.\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 I appreciate the support and the check\u2011in. That text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988 included is fine. I\u2019ll lean on Riley tonight with the phone held and Aisha as my backup; I may not reply right away in the morning but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ll check in. If I start to feel unsafe I will call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this \u2014 that took courage. Over the past two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating, finishing tasks, or making decisions (for example with schoolwork, sketching, or art\u2011school things)? Can you share a couple concrete examples, how often it\u2019s been happening, and whether it\u2019s getting in the way of day\u2011to\u2011day functioning?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 over the past two weeks I\u2019ve noticed trouble concentrating and making decisions, but it\u2019s intermittent rather than constant. It comes up several times a week, and it\u2019s definitely worse when I\u2019m tired, stressed, or caught up in comparing portfolios late at night while I\u2019m scrolling.\n\nConcrete examples: I missed an early art\u2011school deadline right after the move because I kept putting off finishing and submitting the pieces. I\u2019m procrastinating on portfolio edits more than I used to \u2014 a task that used to take an afternoon stretches into days. Picking which works to include takes me much longer now; I\u2019ll sit with the same six pieces and be unable to decide the order or which to cut, and small technical choices feel magnified and exhausting.\n\nDaytime functioning is largely intact \u2014 I\u2019m going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping my sketching hour most nights \u2014 but these lapses slow me down, lower the energy and quality of my work, and undermine momentum. It\u2019s frustrating because I can do the tasks in principle, but the extra time and indecision are making progress feel much harder than it should be.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and tiring, Maya. Over the past two weeks, have you felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 and how often (daily, several times a week)? Please give a couple concrete examples of how that low energy gets in the way of school, your caf\u00e9 shifts, or sketching; does rest or caffeine help at all, is it worse in the morning or evening, and on a scale from 0\u201310 how severe would you rate your typical energy loss?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 energy loss isn\u2019t a major problem for me right now. Daytime functioning is pretty intact: I\u2019m keeping up with school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping a nightly sketching habit most evenings. The main issue is these evening dips after poor sleep and rumination; when I\u2019m up late scrolling I get mentally drained and even a simple portfolio edit will drag on for hours. For example, picking and sequencing pieces that used to take me an afternoon now stretches over several nights, and an editing session that should be brisk becomes slow and fiddly once I\u2019m tired. Caffeine in the morning helps me feel alert for classes and shifts, and a short rest or a five\u2011minute sketch can reset me enough to keep going, but those things don\u2019t eliminate how vulnerable I feel at night. Overall I\u2019d rate typical energy loss about a 1 out of 10 \u2014 it\u2019s low most days, with the exception of those worse evenings.\nDoctor: Maya, thanks \u2014 that makes sense and I hear how evenings are the hardest. Lately have you been feeling unusually guilty or like you\u2019re a failure (for example blaming yourself for the missed deadline or for comparing yourself to others)? How often do those thoughts come up, can you give a couple concrete examples, do they get in the way of your day\u2011to\u2011day life, and how strong would you rate those feelings on a 0\u201310 scale?\nPatient: I don\u2019t feel unusually guilty or like a failure overall. Mostly it\u2019s occasional frustration or mild self\u2011reproach \u2014 a few times a week at most \u2014 and it\u2019s usually tied to evenings when I\u2019m tired or ruminating. For example, I\u2019ll blame myself briefly for missing that early art\u2011school deadline after the move, or get annoyed at myself for procrastinating on portfolio edits. Another example is feeling discouraged when I compare my work to others online and wonder if I\u2019ve already fallen behind.\n\nThose thoughts are irritating and they slow me down and sap motivation, but they don\u2019t stop me from going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, or keeping up my sketching routine. On a 0\u201310 scale I\u2019d put that feeling around a 1 out of 10 \u2014 present sometimes, but pretty mild and not pervasive.\nDoctor: Thank you \u2014 that\u2019s helpful to hear. Over the past two weeks, have you noticed being physically slowed down (moving, speaking, or thinking more slowly) or, on the other hand, feeling more fidgety or restless and unable to sit still? If so, can you give one or two concrete examples, say how often it happens, and whether roommates, classmates, or coworkers have noticed or it\u2019s gotten in the way of school or your caf\u00e9 shifts? Take your time.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t been noticeably slowed down during the day \u2014 I move and speak about the same and my thinking feels clear enough to get through classes and shifts. What I do notice is situational restlessness at night when I\u2019m up ruminating: a few nights a week I\u2019ll pace around the apartment, bounce my leg, or keep picking at something on the table and tapping it as a way to burn off the restless energy. Sometimes I feel a little mentally foggy the next morning after a really bad night of sleep and rumination, but that\u2019s pretty uncommon.\n\nMy roommates, classmates, and coworkers haven\u2019t really commented on any of this, and it hasn\u2019t meaningfully interfered with school or my caf\u00e9 shifts. It\u2019s mostly an evening thing that makes the nights feel longer and makes focusing on portfolio work harder.\nDoctor: I\u2019m sorry nights have been so rough, Maya \u2014 that sounds exhausting. Can you tell me: how long does it usually take you to fall asleep, do you have trouble staying asleep or wake up early, and roughly how many hours do you get most nights and how many nights per week this happens; do the ruminating thoughts keep you from falling asleep or wake you up, do you nap or use caffeine or any sleep aids, when did this pattern start, and how non\u2011restorative does your sleep feel \u2014 and if you like, I can go over some practical nighttime strategies after you describe it.\nPatient: Usually it takes me about an hour to two hours to fall asleep once I try to go to bed. I wake up several times most nights \u2014 typically two to four awakenings \u2014 and more often than not I end up scrolling when I wake, which drags the night out. I\u2019m getting roughly four to six hours total on most nights, about five to six nights a week. The rumination is the main problem: those looping thoughts keep me from falling asleep and then pull me awake during the night. I don\u2019t nap regularly, and I only use caffeine in the morning which helps for classes and shifts; I don\u2019t take prescription sleep aids. This pattern has gotten worse over the last few months since the move and missing deadlines. Sleep feels non\u2011restorative \u2014 mornings are usually okay, but after a really bad night I\u2019ll feel foggy and slower. I\u2019m open to trying practical nighttime strategies and would like concrete suggestions I can actually do.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve been doing a lot to cope already \u2014 that sleep pattern sounds really wearing. Tonight, a few concrete things to try: hand your phone to Riley and do a 30\u201360 minute no\u2011screen wind\u2011down (5\u2011minute doodle + the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding), if you can\u2019t fall asleep after ~20 minutes get up and do a short quiet sketch or a slow walk until you feel sleepy, enable an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter and keep caffeine to mornings, and try a consistent wake time plus a quick progressive muscle relaxation before bed. Which one or two of those feel most doable to try tonight, and would you like me to add them to the written plan?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nYou\u2019ve been doing a lot to cope already \u2014 that sleep pattern sounds really wearing.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave. I\u2019ll send the exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988, and it\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t reply right away. Please lean on Riley or Aisha tonight, and if you feel unsafe at any point call 988, your local crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency department.\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 I appreciate the support and the check\u2011in. That text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988 included is fine. I\u2019ll lean on Riley tonight with the phone held and Aisha as my backup; I may not reply right away in the morning but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ll check in. If I start to feel unsafe I will call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this \u2014 that took courage. Over the past two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating, finishing tasks, or making decisions (for example with schoolwork, sketching, or art\u2011school things)? Can you share a couple concrete examples, how often it\u2019s been happening, and whether it\u2019s getting in the way of day\u2011to\u2011day functioning?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 over the past two weeks I\u2019ve noticed trouble concentrating and making decisions, but it\u2019s intermittent rather than constant. It comes up several times a week, and it\u2019s definitely worse when I\u2019m tired, stressed, or caught up in comparing portfolios late at night while I\u2019m scrolling.\n\nConcrete examples: I missed an early art\u2011school deadline right after the move because I kept putting off finishing and submitting the pieces. I\u2019m procrastinating on portfolio edits more than I used to \u2014 a task that used to take an afternoon stretches into days. Picking which works to include takes me much longer now; I\u2019ll sit with the same six pieces and be unable to decide the order or which to cut, and small technical choices feel magnified and exhausting.\n\nDaytime functioning is largely intact \u2014 I\u2019m going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping my sketching hour most nights \u2014 but these lapses slow me down, lower the energy and quality of my work, and undermine momentum. It\u2019s frustrating because I can do the tasks in principle, but the extra time and indecision are making progress feel much harder than it should be.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and tiring, Maya. Over the past two weeks, have you felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 and how often (daily, several times a week)? Please give a couple concrete examples of how that low energy gets in the way of school, your caf\u00e9 shifts, or sketching; does rest or caffeine help at all, is it worse in the morning or evening, and on a scale from 0\u201310 how severe would you rate your typical energy loss?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 energy loss isn\u2019t a major problem for me right now. Daytime functioning is pretty intact: I\u2019m keeping up with school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping a nightly sketching habit most evenings. The main issue is these evening dips after poor sleep and rumination; when I\u2019m up late scrolling I get mentally drained and even a simple portfolio edit will drag on for hours. For example, picking and sequencing pieces that used to take me an afternoon now stretches over several nights, and an editing session that should be brisk becomes slow and fiddly once I\u2019m tired. Caffeine in the morning helps me feel alert for classes and shifts, and a short rest or a five\u2011minute sketch can reset me enough to keep going, but those things don\u2019t eliminate how vulnerable I feel at night. Overall I\u2019d rate typical energy loss about a 1 out of 10 \u2014 it\u2019s low most days, with the exception of those worse evenings.\nDoctor: Maya, thanks \u2014 that makes sense and I hear how evenings are the hardest. Lately have you been feeling unusually guilty or like you\u2019re a failure (for example blaming yourself for the missed deadline or for comparing yourself to others)? How often do those thoughts come up, can you give a couple concrete examples, do they get in the way of your day\u2011to\u2011day life, and how strong would you rate those feelings on a 0\u201310 scale?\nPatient: I don\u2019t feel unusually guilty or like a failure overall. Mostly it\u2019s occasional frustration or mild self\u2011reproach \u2014 a few times a week at most \u2014 and it\u2019s usually tied to evenings when I\u2019m tired or ruminating. For example, I\u2019ll blame myself briefly for missing that early art\u2011school deadline after the move, or get annoyed at myself for procrastinating on portfolio edits. Another example is feeling discouraged when I compare my work to others online and wonder if I\u2019ve already fallen behind.\n\nThose thoughts are irritating and they slow me down and sap motivation, but they don\u2019t stop me from going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, or keeping up my sketching routine. On a 0\u201310 scale I\u2019d put that feeling around a 1 out of 10 \u2014 present sometimes, but pretty mild and not pervasive.\nDoctor: Thank you \u2014 that\u2019s helpful to hear. Over the past two weeks, have you noticed being physically slowed down (moving, speaking, or thinking more slowly) or, on the other hand, feeling more fidgety or restless and unable to sit still? If so, can you give one or two concrete examples, say how often it happens, and whether roommates, classmates, or coworkers have noticed or it\u2019s gotten in the way of school or your caf\u00e9 shifts? Take your time.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t been noticeably slowed down during the day \u2014 I move and speak about the same and my thinking feels clear enough to get through classes and shifts. What I do notice is situational restlessness at night when I\u2019m up ruminating: a few nights a week I\u2019ll pace around the apartment, bounce my leg, or keep picking at something on the table and tapping it as a way to burn off the restless energy. Sometimes I feel a little mentally foggy the next morning after a really bad night of sleep and rumination, but that\u2019s pretty uncommon.\n\nMy roommates, classmates, and coworkers haven\u2019t really commented on any of this, and it hasn\u2019t meaningfully interfered with school or my caf\u00e9 shifts. It\u2019s mostly an evening thing that makes the nights feel longer and makes focusing on portfolio work harder.\nDoctor: I\u2019m sorry nights have been so rough, Maya \u2014 that sounds exhausting. Can you tell me: how long does it usually take you to fall asleep, do you have trouble staying asleep or wake up early, and roughly how many hours do you get most nights and how many nights per week this happens; do the ruminating thoughts keep you from falling asleep or wake you up, do you nap or use caffeine or any sleep aids, when did this pattern start, and how non\u2011restorative does your sleep feel \u2014 and if you like, I can go over some practical nighttime strategies after you describe it.\nPatient: Usually it takes me about an hour to two hours to fall asleep once I try to go to bed. I wake up several times most nights \u2014 typically two to four awakenings \u2014 and more often than not I end up scrolling when I wake, which drags the night out. I\u2019m getting roughly four to six hours total on most nights, about five to six nights a week. The rumination is the main problem: those looping thoughts keep me from falling asleep and then pull me awake during the night. I don\u2019t nap regularly, and I only use caffeine in the morning which helps for classes and shifts; I don\u2019t take prescription sleep aids. This pattern has gotten worse over the last few months since the move and missing deadlines. Sleep feels non\u2011restorative \u2014 mornings are usually okay, but after a really bad night I\u2019ll feel foggy and slower. I\u2019m open to trying practical nighttime strategies and would like concrete suggestions I can actually do.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve been doing a lot to cope already \u2014 that sleep pattern sounds really wearing. Tonight, a few concrete things to try: hand your phone to Riley and do a 30\u201360 minute no\u2011screen wind\u2011down (5\u2011minute doodle + the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding), if you can\u2019t fall asleep after ~20 minutes get up and do a short quiet sketch or a slow walk until you feel sleepy, enable an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter and keep caffeine to mornings, and try a consistent wake time plus a quick progressive muscle relaxation before bed. Which one or two of those feel most doable to try tonight, and would you like me to add them to the written plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll try the 30\u201360 minute no\u2011screen wind\u2011down tonight \u2014 starting with a five\u2011minute doodle and then the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding exercise. If I\u2019m still awake after about twenty minutes, I\u2019ll get up and do a short quiet sketch or take a slow walk until I feel sleepy. Riley holding my phone is the primary phone\u2011removal step and I\u2019ll enable an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter as a backup. Please add those exact steps to the written safety/sleep plan, and I\u2019d like progressive muscle relaxation and a consistent wake time included as optional strategies. The main barrier is the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement to hold the phone tonight makes handing it over feel doable, and I\u2019m willing to try these steps.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nI\u2019ll try the 30\u201360 minute no\u2011screen wind\u2011down tonight \u2014 starting with a five\u2011minute doodle and then the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding exercise.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave. I\u2019ll send the exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988, and it\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t reply right away. Please lean on Riley or Aisha tonight, and if you feel unsafe at any point call 988, your local crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency department.\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 I appreciate the support and the check\u2011in. That text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988 included is fine. I\u2019ll lean on Riley tonight with the phone held and Aisha as my backup; I may not reply right away in the morning but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ll check in. If I start to feel unsafe I will call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this \u2014 that took courage. Over the past two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating, finishing tasks, or making decisions (for example with schoolwork, sketching, or art\u2011school things)? Can you share a couple concrete examples, how often it\u2019s been happening, and whether it\u2019s getting in the way of day\u2011to\u2011day functioning?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 over the past two weeks I\u2019ve noticed trouble concentrating and making decisions, but it\u2019s intermittent rather than constant. It comes up several times a week, and it\u2019s definitely worse when I\u2019m tired, stressed, or caught up in comparing portfolios late at night while I\u2019m scrolling.\n\nConcrete examples: I missed an early art\u2011school deadline right after the move because I kept putting off finishing and submitting the pieces. I\u2019m procrastinating on portfolio edits more than I used to \u2014 a task that used to take an afternoon stretches into days. Picking which works to include takes me much longer now; I\u2019ll sit with the same six pieces and be unable to decide the order or which to cut, and small technical choices feel magnified and exhausting.\n\nDaytime functioning is largely intact \u2014 I\u2019m going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping my sketching hour most nights \u2014 but these lapses slow me down, lower the energy and quality of my work, and undermine momentum. It\u2019s frustrating because I can do the tasks in principle, but the extra time and indecision are making progress feel much harder than it should be.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and tiring, Maya. Over the past two weeks, have you felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 and how often (daily, several times a week)? Please give a couple concrete examples of how that low energy gets in the way of school, your caf\u00e9 shifts, or sketching; does rest or caffeine help at all, is it worse in the morning or evening, and on a scale from 0\u201310 how severe would you rate your typical energy loss?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 energy loss isn\u2019t a major problem for me right now. Daytime functioning is pretty intact: I\u2019m keeping up with school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping a nightly sketching habit most evenings. The main issue is these evening dips after poor sleep and rumination; when I\u2019m up late scrolling I get mentally drained and even a simple portfolio edit will drag on for hours. For example, picking and sequencing pieces that used to take me an afternoon now stretches over several nights, and an editing session that should be brisk becomes slow and fiddly once I\u2019m tired. Caffeine in the morning helps me feel alert for classes and shifts, and a short rest or a five\u2011minute sketch can reset me enough to keep going, but those things don\u2019t eliminate how vulnerable I feel at night. Overall I\u2019d rate typical energy loss about a 1 out of 10 \u2014 it\u2019s low most days, with the exception of those worse evenings.\nDoctor: Maya, thanks \u2014 that makes sense and I hear how evenings are the hardest. Lately have you been feeling unusually guilty or like you\u2019re a failure (for example blaming yourself for the missed deadline or for comparing yourself to others)? How often do those thoughts come up, can you give a couple concrete examples, do they get in the way of your day\u2011to\u2011day life, and how strong would you rate those feelings on a 0\u201310 scale?\nPatient: I don\u2019t feel unusually guilty or like a failure overall. Mostly it\u2019s occasional frustration or mild self\u2011reproach \u2014 a few times a week at most \u2014 and it\u2019s usually tied to evenings when I\u2019m tired or ruminating. For example, I\u2019ll blame myself briefly for missing that early art\u2011school deadline after the move, or get annoyed at myself for procrastinating on portfolio edits. Another example is feeling discouraged when I compare my work to others online and wonder if I\u2019ve already fallen behind.\n\nThose thoughts are irritating and they slow me down and sap motivation, but they don\u2019t stop me from going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, or keeping up my sketching routine. On a 0\u201310 scale I\u2019d put that feeling around a 1 out of 10 \u2014 present sometimes, but pretty mild and not pervasive.\nDoctor: Thank you \u2014 that\u2019s helpful to hear. Over the past two weeks, have you noticed being physically slowed down (moving, speaking, or thinking more slowly) or, on the other hand, feeling more fidgety or restless and unable to sit still? If so, can you give one or two concrete examples, say how often it happens, and whether roommates, classmates, or coworkers have noticed or it\u2019s gotten in the way of school or your caf\u00e9 shifts? Take your time.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t been noticeably slowed down during the day \u2014 I move and speak about the same and my thinking feels clear enough to get through classes and shifts. What I do notice is situational restlessness at night when I\u2019m up ruminating: a few nights a week I\u2019ll pace around the apartment, bounce my leg, or keep picking at something on the table and tapping it as a way to burn off the restless energy. Sometimes I feel a little mentally foggy the next morning after a really bad night of sleep and rumination, but that\u2019s pretty uncommon.\n\nMy roommates, classmates, and coworkers haven\u2019t really commented on any of this, and it hasn\u2019t meaningfully interfered with school or my caf\u00e9 shifts. It\u2019s mostly an evening thing that makes the nights feel longer and makes focusing on portfolio work harder.\nDoctor: I\u2019m sorry nights have been so rough, Maya \u2014 that sounds exhausting. Can you tell me: how long does it usually take you to fall asleep, do you have trouble staying asleep or wake up early, and roughly how many hours do you get most nights and how many nights per week this happens; do the ruminating thoughts keep you from falling asleep or wake you up, do you nap or use caffeine or any sleep aids, when did this pattern start, and how non\u2011restorative does your sleep feel \u2014 and if you like, I can go over some practical nighttime strategies after you describe it.\nPatient: Usually it takes me about an hour to two hours to fall asleep once I try to go to bed. I wake up several times most nights \u2014 typically two to four awakenings \u2014 and more often than not I end up scrolling when I wake, which drags the night out. I\u2019m getting roughly four to six hours total on most nights, about five to six nights a week. The rumination is the main problem: those looping thoughts keep me from falling asleep and then pull me awake during the night. I don\u2019t nap regularly, and I only use caffeine in the morning which helps for classes and shifts; I don\u2019t take prescription sleep aids. This pattern has gotten worse over the last few months since the move and missing deadlines. Sleep feels non\u2011restorative \u2014 mornings are usually okay, but after a really bad night I\u2019ll feel foggy and slower. I\u2019m open to trying practical nighttime strategies and would like concrete suggestions I can actually do.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve been doing a lot to cope already \u2014 that sleep pattern sounds really wearing. Tonight, a few concrete things to try: hand your phone to Riley and do a 30\u201360 minute no\u2011screen wind\u2011down (5\u2011minute doodle + the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding), if you can\u2019t fall asleep after ~20 minutes get up and do a short quiet sketch or a slow walk until you feel sleepy, enable an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter and keep caffeine to mornings, and try a consistent wake time plus a quick progressive muscle relaxation before bed. Which one or two of those feel most doable to try tonight, and would you like me to add them to the written plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll try the 30\u201360 minute no\u2011screen wind\u2011down tonight \u2014 starting with a five\u2011minute doodle and then the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding exercise. If I\u2019m still awake after about twenty minutes, I\u2019ll get up and do a short quiet sketch or take a slow walk until I feel sleepy.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave. I\u2019ll send the exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988, and it\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t reply right away. Please lean on Riley or Aisha tonight, and if you feel unsafe at any point call 988, your local crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency department.\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 I appreciate the support and the check\u2011in. That text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988 included is fine. I\u2019ll lean on Riley tonight with the phone held and Aisha as my backup; I may not reply right away in the morning but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ll check in. If I start to feel unsafe I will call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this \u2014 that took courage. Over the past two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating, finishing tasks, or making decisions (for example with schoolwork, sketching, or art\u2011school things)? Can you share a couple concrete examples, how often it\u2019s been happening, and whether it\u2019s getting in the way of day\u2011to\u2011day functioning?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 over the past two weeks I\u2019ve noticed trouble concentrating and making decisions, but it\u2019s intermittent rather than constant. It comes up several times a week, and it\u2019s definitely worse when I\u2019m tired, stressed, or caught up in comparing portfolios late at night while I\u2019m scrolling.\n\nConcrete examples: I missed an early art\u2011school deadline right after the move because I kept putting off finishing and submitting the pieces. I\u2019m procrastinating on portfolio edits more than I used to \u2014 a task that used to take an afternoon stretches into days. Picking which works to include takes me much longer now; I\u2019ll sit with the same six pieces and be unable to decide the order or which to cut, and small technical choices feel magnified and exhausting.\n\nDaytime functioning is largely intact \u2014 I\u2019m going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping my sketching hour most nights \u2014 but these lapses slow me down, lower the energy and quality of my work, and undermine momentum. It\u2019s frustrating because I can do the tasks in principle, but the extra time and indecision are making progress feel much harder than it should be.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and tiring, Maya. Over the past two weeks, have you felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 and how often (daily, several times a week)? Please give a couple concrete examples of how that low energy gets in the way of school, your caf\u00e9 shifts, or sketching; does rest or caffeine help at all, is it worse in the morning or evening, and on a scale from 0\u201310 how severe would you rate your typical energy loss?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 energy loss isn\u2019t a major problem for me right now. Daytime functioning is pretty intact: I\u2019m keeping up with school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping a nightly sketching habit most evenings. The main issue is these evening dips after poor sleep and rumination; when I\u2019m up late scrolling I get mentally drained and even a simple portfolio edit will drag on for hours. For example, picking and sequencing pieces that used to take me an afternoon now stretches over several nights, and an editing session that should be brisk becomes slow and fiddly once I\u2019m tired. Caffeine in the morning helps me feel alert for classes and shifts, and a short rest or a five\u2011minute sketch can reset me enough to keep going, but those things don\u2019t eliminate how vulnerable I feel at night. Overall I\u2019d rate typical energy loss about a 1 out of 10 \u2014 it\u2019s low most days, with the exception of those worse evenings.\nDoctor: Maya, thanks \u2014 that makes sense and I hear how evenings are the hardest. Lately have you been feeling unusually guilty or like you\u2019re a failure (for example blaming yourself for the missed deadline or for comparing yourself to others)? How often do those thoughts come up, can you give a couple concrete examples, do they get in the way of your day\u2011to\u2011day life, and how strong would you rate those feelings on a 0\u201310 scale?\nPatient: I don\u2019t feel unusually guilty or like a failure overall. Mostly it\u2019s occasional frustration or mild self\u2011reproach \u2014 a few times a week at most \u2014 and it\u2019s usually tied to evenings when I\u2019m tired or ruminating. For example, I\u2019ll blame myself briefly for missing that early art\u2011school deadline after the move, or get annoyed at myself for procrastinating on portfolio edits. Another example is feeling discouraged when I compare my work to others online and wonder if I\u2019ve already fallen behind.\n\nThose thoughts are irritating and they slow me down and sap motivation, but they don\u2019t stop me from going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, or keeping up my sketching routine. On a 0\u201310 scale I\u2019d put that feeling around a 1 out of 10 \u2014 present sometimes, but pretty mild and not pervasive.\nDoctor: Thank you \u2014 that\u2019s helpful to hear. Over the past two weeks, have you noticed being physically slowed down (moving, speaking, or thinking more slowly) or, on the other hand, feeling more fidgety or restless and unable to sit still? If so, can you give one or two concrete examples, say how often it happens, and whether roommates, classmates, or coworkers have noticed or it\u2019s gotten in the way of school or your caf\u00e9 shifts? Take your time.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t been noticeably slowed down during the day \u2014 I move and speak about the same and my thinking feels clear enough to get through classes and shifts. What I do notice is situational restlessness at night when I\u2019m up ruminating: a few nights a week I\u2019ll pace around the apartment, bounce my leg, or keep picking at something on the table and tapping it as a way to burn off the restless energy. Sometimes I feel a little mentally foggy the next morning after a really bad night of sleep and rumination, but that\u2019s pretty uncommon.\n\nMy roommates, classmates, and coworkers haven\u2019t really commented on any of this, and it hasn\u2019t meaningfully interfered with school or my caf\u00e9 shifts. It\u2019s mostly an evening thing that makes the nights feel longer and makes focusing on portfolio work harder.\nDoctor: I\u2019m sorry nights have been so rough, Maya \u2014 that sounds exhausting. Can you tell me: how long does it usually take you to fall asleep, do you have trouble staying asleep or wake up early, and roughly how many hours do you get most nights and how many nights per week this happens; do the ruminating thoughts keep you from falling asleep or wake you up, do you nap or use caffeine or any sleep aids, when did this pattern start, and how non\u2011restorative does your sleep feel \u2014 and if you like, I can go over some practical nighttime strategies after you describe it.\nPatient: Usually it takes me about an hour to two hours to fall asleep once I try to go to bed. I wake up several times most nights \u2014 typically two to four awakenings \u2014 and more often than not I end up scrolling when I wake, which drags the night out. I\u2019m getting roughly four to six hours total on most nights, about five to six nights a week. The rumination is the main problem: those looping thoughts keep me from falling asleep and then pull me awake during the night. I don\u2019t nap regularly, and I only use caffeine in the morning which helps for classes and shifts; I don\u2019t take prescription sleep aids. This pattern has gotten worse over the last few months since the move and missing deadlines. Sleep feels non\u2011restorative \u2014 mornings are usually okay, but after a really bad night I\u2019ll feel foggy and slower. I\u2019m open to trying practical nighttime strategies and would like concrete suggestions I can actually do.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve been doing a lot to cope already \u2014 that sleep pattern sounds really wearing. Tonight, a few concrete things to try: hand your phone to Riley and do a 30\u201360 minute no\u2011screen wind\u2011down (5\u2011minute doodle + the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding), if you can\u2019t fall asleep after ~20 minutes get up and do a short quiet sketch or a slow walk until you feel sleepy, enable an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter and keep caffeine to mornings, and try a consistent wake time plus a quick progressive muscle relaxation before bed. Which one or two of those feel most doable to try tonight, and would you like me to add them to the written plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll try the 30\u201360 minute no\u2011screen wind\u2011down tonight \u2014 starting with a five\u2011minute doodle and then the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding exercise. If I\u2019m still awake after about twenty minutes, I\u2019ll get up and do a short quiet sketch or take a slow walk until I feel sleepy. Riley holding my phone is the primary phone\u2011removal step and I\u2019ll enable an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter as a backup. Please add those exact steps to the written safety/sleep plan, and I\u2019d like progressive muscle relaxation and a consistent wake time included as optional strategies. The main barrier is the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement to hold the phone tonight makes handing it over feel doable, and I\u2019m willing to try these steps.\nDoctor: I\u2019ll add those exact steps to your written safety and sleep plan. Here\u2019s a one\u2011sentence progressive muscle relaxation cue you can use: \u201cSit or lie comfortably and, starting with your toes, tense each muscle group for 5\u20137 seconds then fully release while taking a slow breath, moving up through your body to your head\u201d; anything else you\u2019d like included?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 please include the progressive muscle relaxation cue exactly as written: \u201cSit or lie comfortably and, starting with your toes, tense each muscle group for 5\u20137 seconds then fully release while taking a slow breath, moving up through your body to your head.\u201d  \n\nAlso add progressive muscle relaxation and a consistent wake time as optional strategies to the written plan.

I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup.

It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave. I\u2019ll send the exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988, and it\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t reply right away. Please lean on Riley or Aisha tonight, and if you feel unsafe at any point call 988, your local crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency department.\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 I appreciate the support and the check\u2011in. That text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988 included is fine. I\u2019ll lean on Riley tonight with the phone held and Aisha as my backup; I may not reply right away in the morning but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ll check in. If I start to feel unsafe I will call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this \u2014 that took courage. Over the past two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating, finishing tasks, or making decisions (for example with schoolwork, sketching, or art\u2011school things)? Can you share a couple concrete examples, how often it\u2019s been happening, and whether it\u2019s getting in the way of day\u2011to\u2011day functioning?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 over the past two weeks I\u2019ve noticed trouble concentrating and making decisions, but it\u2019s intermittent rather than constant. It comes up several times a week, and it\u2019s definitely worse when I\u2019m tired, stressed, or caught up in comparing portfolios late at night while I\u2019m scrolling.\n\nConcrete examples: I missed an early art\u2011school deadline right after the move because I kept putting off finishing and submitting the pieces. I\u2019m procrastinating on portfolio edits more than I used to \u2014 a task that used to take an afternoon stretches into days. Picking which works to include takes me much longer now; I\u2019ll sit with the same six pieces and be unable to decide the order or which to cut, and small technical choices feel magnified and exhausting.\n\nDaytime functioning is largely intact \u2014 I\u2019m going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping my sketching hour most nights \u2014 but these lapses slow me down, lower the energy and quality of my work, and undermine momentum. It\u2019s frustrating because I can do the tasks in principle, but the extra time and indecision are making progress feel much harder than it should be.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and tiring, Maya. Over the past two weeks, have you felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 and how often (daily, several times a week)? Please give a couple concrete examples of how that low energy gets in the way of school, your caf\u00e9 shifts, or sketching; does rest or caffeine help at all, is it worse in the morning or evening, and on a scale from 0\u201310 how severe would you rate your typical energy loss?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 energy loss isn\u2019t a major problem for me right now. Daytime functioning is pretty intact: I\u2019m keeping up with school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping a nightly sketching habit most evenings. The main issue is these evening dips after poor sleep and rumination; when I\u2019m up late scrolling I get mentally drained and even a simple portfolio edit will drag on for hours. For example, picking and sequencing pieces that used to take me an afternoon now stretches over several nights, and an editing session that should be brisk becomes slow and fiddly once I\u2019m tired. Caffeine in the morning helps me feel alert for classes and shifts, and a short rest or a five\u2011minute sketch can reset me enough to keep going, but those things don\u2019t eliminate how vulnerable I feel at night. Overall I\u2019d rate typical energy loss about a 1 out of 10 \u2014 it\u2019s low most days, with the exception of those worse evenings.\nDoctor: Maya, thanks \u2014 that makes sense and I hear how evenings are the hardest. Lately have you been feeling unusually guilty or like you\u2019re a failure (for example blaming yourself for the missed deadline or for comparing yourself to others)? How often do those thoughts come up, can you give a couple concrete examples, do they get in the way of your day\u2011to\u2011day life, and how strong would you rate those feelings on a 0\u201310 scale?\nPatient: I don\u2019t feel unusually guilty or like a failure overall. Mostly it\u2019s occasional frustration or mild self\u2011reproach \u2014 a few times a week at most \u2014 and it\u2019s usually tied to evenings when I\u2019m tired or ruminating. For example, I\u2019ll blame myself briefly for missing that early art\u2011school deadline after the move, or get annoyed at myself for procrastinating on portfolio edits. Another example is feeling discouraged when I compare my work to others online and wonder if I\u2019ve already fallen behind.\n\nThose thoughts are irritating and they slow me down and sap motivation, but they don\u2019t stop me from going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, or keeping up my sketching routine. On a 0\u201310 scale I\u2019d put that feeling around a 1 out of 10 \u2014 present sometimes, but pretty mild and not pervasive.\nDoctor: Thank you \u2014 that\u2019s helpful to hear. Over the past two weeks, have you noticed being physically slowed down (moving, speaking, or thinking more slowly) or, on the other hand, feeling more fidgety or restless and unable to sit still? If so, can you give one or two concrete examples, say how often it happens, and whether roommates, classmates, or coworkers have noticed or it\u2019s gotten in the way of school or your caf\u00e9 shifts? Take your time.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t been noticeably slowed down during the day \u2014 I move and speak about the same and my thinking feels clear enough to get through classes and shifts. What I do notice is situational restlessness at night when I\u2019m up ruminating: a few nights a week I\u2019ll pace around the apartment, bounce my leg, or keep picking at something on the table and tapping it as a way to burn off the restless energy. Sometimes I feel a little mentally foggy the next morning after a really bad night of sleep and rumination, but that\u2019s pretty uncommon.\n\nMy roommates, classmates, and coworkers haven\u2019t really commented on any of this, and it hasn\u2019t meaningfully interfered with school or my caf\u00e9 shifts. It\u2019s mostly an evening thing that makes the nights feel longer and makes focusing on portfolio work harder.\nDoctor: I\u2019m sorry nights have been so rough, Maya \u2014 that sounds exhausting. Can you tell me: how long does it usually take you to fall asleep, do you have trouble staying asleep or wake up early, and roughly how many hours do you get most nights and how many nights per week this happens; do the ruminating thoughts keep you from falling asleep or wake you up, do you nap or use caffeine or any sleep aids, when did this pattern start, and how non\u2011restorative does your sleep feel \u2014 and if you like, I can go over some practical nighttime strategies after you describe it.\nPatient: Usually it takes me about an hour to two hours to fall asleep once I try to go to bed. I wake up several times most nights \u2014 typically two to four awakenings \u2014 and more often than not I end up scrolling when I wake, which drags the night out. I\u2019m getting roughly four to six hours total on most nights, about five to six nights a week. The rumination is the main problem: those looping thoughts keep me from falling asleep and then pull me awake during the night. I don\u2019t nap regularly, and I only use caffeine in the morning which helps for classes and shifts; I don\u2019t take prescription sleep aids. This pattern has gotten worse over the last few months since the move and missing deadlines. Sleep feels non\u2011restorative \u2014 mornings are usually okay, but after a really bad night I\u2019ll feel foggy and slower. I\u2019m open to trying practical nighttime strategies and would like concrete suggestions I can actually do.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve been doing a lot to cope already \u2014 that sleep pattern sounds really wearing. Tonight, a few concrete things to try: hand your phone to Riley and do a 30\u201360 minute no\u2011screen wind\u2011down (5\u2011minute doodle + the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding), if you can\u2019t fall asleep after ~20 minutes get up and do a short quiet sketch or a slow walk until you feel sleepy, enable an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter and keep caffeine to mornings, and try a consistent wake time plus a quick progressive muscle relaxation before bed. Which one or two of those feel most doable to try tonight, and would you like me to add them to the written plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll try the 30\u201360 minute no\u2011screen wind\u2011down tonight \u2014 starting with a five\u2011minute doodle and then the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding exercise. If I\u2019m still awake after about twenty minutes, I\u2019ll get up and do a short quiet sketch or take a slow walk until I feel sleepy. Riley holding my phone is the primary phone\u2011removal step and I\u2019ll enable an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter as a backup. Please add those exact steps to the written safety/sleep plan, and I\u2019d like progressive muscle relaxation and a consistent wake time included as optional strategies. The main barrier is the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement to hold the phone tonight makes handing it over feel doable, and I\u2019m willing to try these steps.\nDoctor: I\u2019ll add those exact steps to your written safety and sleep plan. Here\u2019s a one\u2011sentence progressive muscle relaxation cue you can use: \u201cSit or lie comfortably and, starting with your toes, tense each muscle group for 5\u20137 seconds then fully release while taking a slow breath, moving up through your body to your head\u201d; anything else you\u2019d like included?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 please include the progressive muscle relaxation cue exactly as written: \u201cSit or lie comfortably and, starting with your toes, tense each muscle group for 5\u20137 seconds then fully release while taking a slow breath, moving up through your body to your head.\u201d  \n\nAlso add progressive muscle relaxation and a consistent wake time as optional strategies to the written plan. Please note Riley will hold my phone tonight and Aisha is my backup, and include the local crisis number and 988. Please keep the sleep and safety steps exactly as we discussed: a five\u2011minute doodle, the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding exercise, the ~20\u2011minute get\u2011up rule with a short quiet sketch or slow walk if still awake, and an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter as a backup.  \n\nThanks again \u2014 I appreciate you putting this together.\nDoctor: Maya, you\u2019ve been really thorough \u2014 thank you.

I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave. I\u2019ll send the exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988, and it\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t reply right away. Please lean on Riley or Aisha tonight, and if you feel unsafe at any point call 988, your local crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency department.\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 I appreciate the support and the check\u2011in. That text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988 included is fine. I\u2019ll lean on Riley tonight with the phone held and Aisha as my backup; I may not reply right away in the morning but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ll check in. If I start to feel unsafe I will call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this \u2014 that took courage. Over the past two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating, finishing tasks, or making decisions (for example with schoolwork, sketching, or art\u2011school things)? Can you share a couple concrete examples, how often it\u2019s been happening, and whether it\u2019s getting in the way of day\u2011to\u2011day functioning?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 over the past two weeks I\u2019ve noticed trouble concentrating and making decisions, but it\u2019s intermittent rather than constant. It comes up several times a week, and it\u2019s definitely worse when I\u2019m tired, stressed, or caught up in comparing portfolios late at night while I\u2019m scrolling.\n\nConcrete examples: I missed an early art\u2011school deadline right after the move because I kept putting off finishing and submitting the pieces. I\u2019m procrastinating on portfolio edits more than I used to \u2014 a task that used to take an afternoon stretches into days. Picking which works to include takes me much longer now; I\u2019ll sit with the same six pieces and be unable to decide the order or which to cut, and small technical choices feel magnified and exhausting.\n\nDaytime functioning is largely intact \u2014 I\u2019m going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping my sketching hour most nights \u2014 but these lapses slow me down, lower the energy and quality of my work, and undermine momentum. It\u2019s frustrating because I can do the tasks in principle, but the extra time and indecision are making progress feel much harder than it should be.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and tiring, Maya. Over the past two weeks, have you felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 and how often (daily, several times a week)? Please give a couple concrete examples of how that low energy gets in the way of school, your caf\u00e9 shifts, or sketching; does rest or caffeine help at all, is it worse in the morning or evening, and on a scale from 0\u201310 how severe would you rate your typical energy loss?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 energy loss isn\u2019t a major problem for me right now. Daytime functioning is pretty intact: I\u2019m keeping up with school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping a nightly sketching habit most evenings. The main issue is these evening dips after poor sleep and rumination; when I\u2019m up late scrolling I get mentally drained and even a simple portfolio edit will drag on for hours. For example, picking and sequencing pieces that used to take me an afternoon now stretches over several nights, and an editing session that should be brisk becomes slow and fiddly once I\u2019m tired. Caffeine in the morning helps me feel alert for classes and shifts, and a short rest or a five\u2011minute sketch can reset me enough to keep going, but those things don\u2019t eliminate how vulnerable I feel at night. Overall I\u2019d rate typical energy loss about a 1 out of 10 \u2014 it\u2019s low most days, with the exception of those worse evenings.\nDoctor: Maya, thanks \u2014 that makes sense and I hear how evenings are the hardest. Lately have you been feeling unusually guilty or like you\u2019re a failure (for example blaming yourself for the missed deadline or for comparing yourself to others)? How often do those thoughts come up, can you give a couple concrete examples, do they get in the way of your day\u2011to\u2011day life, and how strong would you rate those feelings on a 0\u201310 scale?\nPatient: I don\u2019t feel unusually guilty or like a failure overall. Mostly it\u2019s occasional frustration or mild self\u2011reproach \u2014 a few times a week at most \u2014 and it\u2019s usually tied to evenings when I\u2019m tired or ruminating. For example, I\u2019ll blame myself briefly for missing that early art\u2011school deadline after the move, or get annoyed at myself for procrastinating on portfolio edits. Another example is feeling discouraged when I compare my work to others online and wonder if I\u2019ve already fallen behind.\n\nThose thoughts are irritating and they slow me down and sap motivation, but they don\u2019t stop me from going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, or keeping up my sketching routine. On a 0\u201310 scale I\u2019d put that feeling around a 1 out of 10 \u2014 present sometimes, but pretty mild and not pervasive.\nDoctor: Thank you \u2014 that\u2019s helpful to hear. Over the past two weeks, have you noticed being physically slowed down (moving, speaking, or thinking more slowly) or, on the other hand, feeling more fidgety or restless and unable to sit still? If so, can you give one or two concrete examples, say how often it happens, and whether roommates, classmates, or coworkers have noticed or it\u2019s gotten in the way of school or your caf\u00e9 shifts? Take your time.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t been noticeably slowed down during the day \u2014 I move and speak about the same and my thinking feels clear enough to get through classes and shifts. What I do notice is situational restlessness at night when I\u2019m up ruminating: a few nights a week I\u2019ll pace around the apartment, bounce my leg, or keep picking at something on the table and tapping it as a way to burn off the restless energy. Sometimes I feel a little mentally foggy the next morning after a really bad night of sleep and rumination, but that\u2019s pretty uncommon.\n\nMy roommates, classmates, and coworkers haven\u2019t really commented on any of this, and it hasn\u2019t meaningfully interfered with school or my caf\u00e9 shifts. It\u2019s mostly an evening thing that makes the nights feel longer and makes focusing on portfolio work harder.\nDoctor: I\u2019m sorry nights have been so rough, Maya \u2014 that sounds exhausting. Can you tell me: how long does it usually take you to fall asleep, do you have trouble staying asleep or wake up early, and roughly how many hours do you get most nights and how many nights per week this happens; do the ruminating thoughts keep you from falling asleep or wake you up, do you nap or use caffeine or any sleep aids, when did this pattern start, and how non\u2011restorative does your sleep feel \u2014 and if you like, I can go over some practical nighttime strategies after you describe it.\nPatient: Usually it takes me about an hour to two hours to fall asleep once I try to go to bed. I wake up several times most nights \u2014 typically two to four awakenings \u2014 and more often than not I end up scrolling when I wake, which drags the night out. I\u2019m getting roughly four to six hours total on most nights, about five to six nights a week. The rumination is the main problem: those looping thoughts keep me from falling asleep and then pull me awake during the night. I don\u2019t nap regularly, and I only use caffeine in the morning which helps for classes and shifts; I don\u2019t take prescription sleep aids. This pattern has gotten worse over the last few months since the move and missing deadlines. Sleep feels non\u2011restorative \u2014 mornings are usually okay, but after a really bad night I\u2019ll feel foggy and slower. I\u2019m open to trying practical nighttime strategies and would like concrete suggestions I can actually do.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve been doing a lot to cope already \u2014 that sleep pattern sounds really wearing. Tonight, a few concrete things to try: hand your phone to Riley and do a 30\u201360 minute no\u2011screen wind\u2011down (5\u2011minute doodle + the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding), if you can\u2019t fall asleep after ~20 minutes get up and do a short quiet sketch or a slow walk until you feel sleepy, enable an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter and keep caffeine to mornings, and try a consistent wake time plus a quick progressive muscle relaxation before bed. Which one or two of those feel most doable to try tonight, and would you like me to add them to the written plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll try the 30\u201360 minute no\u2011screen wind\u2011down tonight \u2014 starting with a five\u2011minute doodle and then the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding exercise. If I\u2019m still awake after about twenty minutes, I\u2019ll get up and do a short quiet sketch or take a slow walk until I feel sleepy. Riley holding my phone is the primary phone\u2011removal step and I\u2019ll enable an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter as a backup. Please add those exact steps to the written safety/sleep plan, and I\u2019d like progressive muscle relaxation and a consistent wake time included as optional strategies. The main barrier is the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement to hold the phone tonight makes handing it over feel doable, and I\u2019m willing to try these steps.\nDoctor: I\u2019ll add those exact steps to your written safety and sleep plan. Here\u2019s a one\u2011sentence progressive muscle relaxation cue you can use: \u201cSit or lie comfortably and, starting with your toes, tense each muscle group for 5\u20137 seconds then fully release while taking a slow breath, moving up through your body to your head\u201d; anything else you\u2019d like included?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 please include the progressive muscle relaxation cue exactly as written: \u201cSit or lie comfortably and, starting with your toes, tense each muscle group for 5\u20137 seconds then fully release while taking a slow breath, moving up through your body to your head.\u201d  \n\nAlso add progressive muscle relaxation and a consistent wake time as optional strategies to the written plan. Please note Riley will hold my phone tonight and Aisha is my backup, and include the local crisis number and 988. Please keep the sleep and safety steps exactly as we discussed: a five\u2011minute doodle, the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding exercise, the ~20\u2011minute get\u2011up rule with a short quiet sketch or slow walk if still awake, and an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter as a backup.  \n\nThanks again \u2014 I appreciate you putting this together.\nDoctor: Maya, you\u2019ve been really thorough \u2014 thank you. Over the past two weeks have you been eating more or less than usual, noticed any unintentional weight change, or had changes in appetite (skipping meals, stronger cravings, or nausea)? If so, can you give one or two brief examples, say how often it\u2019s happening, whether it\u2019s affecting school or work, if you\u2019re dieting or on any meds that might explain it, and rate how much of a problem this is from 0\u201310?\nPatient: Appetite changes have been pretty rare and mild. A few times over the past couple of weeks I skipped breakfast after a bad night of sleep and rumination, and sometimes I eat a bit less in the evening when I\u2019m not feeling up to a full meal, but it\u2019s not a regular pattern. I haven\u2019t noticed any unintentional weight change, I\u2019m not dieting, and I\u2019m not taking any medications that would explain appetite shifts. It hasn\u2019t affected school or my caf\u00e9 shifts.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave. I\u2019ll send the exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988, and it\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t reply right away. Please lean on Riley or Aisha tonight, and if you feel unsafe at any point call 988, your local crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency department.\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 I appreciate the support and the check\u2011in. That text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988 included is fine. I\u2019ll lean on Riley tonight with the phone held and Aisha as my backup; I may not reply right away in the morning but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ll check in. If I start to feel unsafe I will call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this \u2014 that took courage. Over the past two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating, finishing tasks, or making decisions (for example with schoolwork, sketching, or art\u2011school things)? Can you share a couple concrete examples, how often it\u2019s been happening, and whether it\u2019s getting in the way of day\u2011to\u2011day functioning?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 over the past two weeks I\u2019ve noticed trouble concentrating and making decisions, but it\u2019s intermittent rather than constant. It comes up several times a week, and it\u2019s definitely worse when I\u2019m tired, stressed, or caught up in comparing portfolios late at night while I\u2019m scrolling.\n\nConcrete examples: I missed an early art\u2011school deadline right after the move because I kept putting off finishing and submitting the pieces. I\u2019m procrastinating on portfolio edits more than I used to \u2014 a task that used to take an afternoon stretches into days. Picking which works to include takes me much longer now; I\u2019ll sit with the same six pieces and be unable to decide the order or which to cut, and small technical choices feel magnified and exhausting.\n\nDaytime functioning is largely intact \u2014 I\u2019m going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping my sketching hour most nights \u2014 but these lapses slow me down, lower the energy and quality of my work, and undermine momentum. It\u2019s frustrating because I can do the tasks in principle, but the extra time and indecision are making progress feel much harder than it should be.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and tiring, Maya. Over the past two weeks, have you felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 and how often (daily, several times a week)? Please give a couple concrete examples of how that low energy gets in the way of school, your caf\u00e9 shifts, or sketching; does rest or caffeine help at all, is it worse in the morning or evening, and on a scale from 0\u201310 how severe would you rate your typical energy loss?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 energy loss isn\u2019t a major problem for me right now. Daytime functioning is pretty intact: I\u2019m keeping up with school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping a nightly sketching habit most evenings. The main issue is these evening dips after poor sleep and rumination; when I\u2019m up late scrolling I get mentally drained and even a simple portfolio edit will drag on for hours. For example, picking and sequencing pieces that used to take me an afternoon now stretches over several nights, and an editing session that should be brisk becomes slow and fiddly once I\u2019m tired. Caffeine in the morning helps me feel alert for classes and shifts, and a short rest or a five\u2011minute sketch can reset me enough to keep going, but those things don\u2019t eliminate how vulnerable I feel at night. Overall I\u2019d rate typical energy loss about a 1 out of 10 \u2014 it\u2019s low most days, with the exception of those worse evenings.\nDoctor: Maya, thanks \u2014 that makes sense and I hear how evenings are the hardest. Lately have you been feeling unusually guilty or like you\u2019re a failure (for example blaming yourself for the missed deadline or for comparing yourself to others)? How often do those thoughts come up, can you give a couple concrete examples, do they get in the way of your day\u2011to\u2011day life, and how strong would you rate those feelings on a 0\u201310 scale?\nPatient: I don\u2019t feel unusually guilty or like a failure overall. Mostly it\u2019s occasional frustration or mild self\u2011reproach \u2014 a few times a week at most \u2014 and it\u2019s usually tied to evenings when I\u2019m tired or ruminating. For example, I\u2019ll blame myself briefly for missing that early art\u2011school deadline after the move, or get annoyed at myself for procrastinating on portfolio edits. Another example is feeling discouraged when I compare my work to others online and wonder if I\u2019ve already fallen behind.\n\nThose thoughts are irritating and they slow me down and sap motivation, but they don\u2019t stop me from going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, or keeping up my sketching routine. On a 0\u201310 scale I\u2019d put that feeling around a 1 out of 10 \u2014 present sometimes, but pretty mild and not pervasive.\nDoctor: Thank you \u2014 that\u2019s helpful to hear. Over the past two weeks, have you noticed being physically slowed down (moving, speaking, or thinking more slowly) or, on the other hand, feeling more fidgety or restless and unable to sit still? If so, can you give one or two concrete examples, say how often it happens, and whether roommates, classmates, or coworkers have noticed or it\u2019s gotten in the way of school or your caf\u00e9 shifts? Take your time.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t been noticeably slowed down during the day \u2014 I move and speak about the same and my thinking feels clear enough to get through classes and shifts. What I do notice is situational restlessness at night when I\u2019m up ruminating: a few nights a week I\u2019ll pace around the apartment, bounce my leg, or keep picking at something on the table and tapping it as a way to burn off the restless energy. Sometimes I feel a little mentally foggy the next morning after a really bad night of sleep and rumination, but that\u2019s pretty uncommon.\n\nMy roommates, classmates, and coworkers haven\u2019t really commented on any of this, and it hasn\u2019t meaningfully interfered with school or my caf\u00e9 shifts. It\u2019s mostly an evening thing that makes the nights feel longer and makes focusing on portfolio work harder.\nDoctor: I\u2019m sorry nights have been so rough, Maya \u2014 that sounds exhausting. Can you tell me: how long does it usually take you to fall asleep, do you have trouble staying asleep or wake up early, and roughly how many hours do you get most nights and how many nights per week this happens; do the ruminating thoughts keep you from falling asleep or wake you up, do you nap or use caffeine or any sleep aids, when did this pattern start, and how non\u2011restorative does your sleep feel \u2014 and if you like, I can go over some practical nighttime strategies after you describe it.\nPatient: Usually it takes me about an hour to two hours to fall asleep once I try to go to bed. I wake up several times most nights \u2014 typically two to four awakenings \u2014 and more often than not I end up scrolling when I wake, which drags the night out. I\u2019m getting roughly four to six hours total on most nights, about five to six nights a week. The rumination is the main problem: those looping thoughts keep me from falling asleep and then pull me awake during the night. I don\u2019t nap regularly, and I only use caffeine in the morning which helps for classes and shifts; I don\u2019t take prescription sleep aids. This pattern has gotten worse over the last few months since the move and missing deadlines. Sleep feels non\u2011restorative \u2014 mornings are usually okay, but after a really bad night I\u2019ll feel foggy and slower. I\u2019m open to trying practical nighttime strategies and would like concrete suggestions I can actually do.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve been doing a lot to cope already \u2014 that sleep pattern sounds really wearing. Tonight, a few concrete things to try: hand your phone to Riley and do a 30\u201360 minute no\u2011screen wind\u2011down (5\u2011minute doodle + the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding), if you can\u2019t fall asleep after ~20 minutes get up and do a short quiet sketch or a slow walk until you feel sleepy, enable an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter and keep caffeine to mornings, and try a consistent wake time plus a quick progressive muscle relaxation before bed. Which one or two of those feel most doable to try tonight, and would you like me to add them to the written plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll try the 30\u201360 minute no\u2011screen wind\u2011down tonight \u2014 starting with a five\u2011minute doodle and then the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding exercise. If I\u2019m still awake after about twenty minutes, I\u2019ll get up and do a short quiet sketch or take a slow walk until I feel sleepy. Riley holding my phone is the primary phone\u2011removal step and I\u2019ll enable an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter as a backup. Please add those exact steps to the written safety/sleep plan, and I\u2019d like progressive muscle relaxation and a consistent wake time included as optional strategies. The main barrier is the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement to hold the phone tonight makes handing it over feel doable, and I\u2019m willing to try these steps.\nDoctor: I\u2019ll add those exact steps to your written safety and sleep plan. Here\u2019s a one\u2011sentence progressive muscle relaxation cue you can use: \u201cSit or lie comfortably and, starting with your toes, tense each muscle group for 5\u20137 seconds then fully release while taking a slow breath, moving up through your body to your head\u201d; anything else you\u2019d like included?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 please include the progressive muscle relaxation cue exactly as written: \u201cSit or lie comfortably and, starting with your toes, tense each muscle group for 5\u20137 seconds then fully release while taking a slow breath, moving up through your body to your head.\u201d  \n\nAlso add progressive muscle relaxation and a consistent wake time as optional strategies to the written plan. Please note Riley will hold my phone tonight and Aisha is my backup, and include the local crisis number and 988. Please keep the sleep and safety steps exactly as we discussed: a five\u2011minute doodle, the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding exercise, the ~20\u2011minute get\u2011up rule with a short quiet sketch or slow walk if still awake, and an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter as a backup.  \n\nThanks again \u2014 I appreciate you putting this together.\nDoctor: Maya, you\u2019ve been really thorough \u2014 thank you. Over the past two weeks have you been eating more or less than usual, noticed any unintentional weight change, or had changes in appetite (skipping meals, stronger cravings, or nausea)? If so, can you give one or two brief examples, say how often it\u2019s happening, whether it\u2019s affecting school or work, if you\u2019re dieting or on any meds that might explain it, and rate how much of a problem this is from 0\u201310?\nPatient: Appetite changes have been pretty rare and mild. A few times over the past couple of weeks I skipped breakfast after a bad night of sleep and rumination, and sometimes I eat a bit less in the evening when I\u2019m not feeling up to a full meal, but it\u2019s not a regular pattern. I haven\u2019t noticed any unintentional weight change, I\u2019m not dieting, and I\u2019m not taking any medications that would explain appetite shifts. It hasn\u2019t affected school or my caf\u00e9 shifts. On a 0\u201310 scale I\u2019d rate this about a 1 out of 10.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that\u2019s helpful. Over the past two weeks, how often have you felt little interest or pleasure in things you usually enjoy (every day, most days, or several times a week)?

      "output": "Most days lately I notice a diminished interest in things I used to enjoy, especially in the evenings. Sketching has become more of a routine task than something that lights me up \u2014 I still draw because it\u2019s part of my day, but it often feels hollow and mechanical. Browsing other students\u2019 portfolios online tends to trigger comparison and demotivation instead of inspiration, and when I hang out with friends I\u2019m there but the conversations feel flatter and less engaging than they used to. I do still get small moments of pleasure sometimes \u2014 a quick sketch that goes well or a really good conversation can brighten me briefly \u2014 so it\u2019s not complete numbness. Overall I\u2019d say this loss of interest interferes with my life at about a 6 out of 10: it slows down portfolio work, makes decision\u2011making harder, and saps momentum even though I\u2019m still keeping up with school and shifts. It\u2019s definitely worse at night when I\u2019m tired and ruminating."

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave. I\u2019ll send the exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988, and it\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t reply right away. Please lean on Riley or Aisha tonight, and if you feel unsafe at any point call 988, your local crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency department.\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 I appreciate the support and the check\u2011in. That text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988 included is fine. I\u2019ll lean on Riley tonight with the phone held and Aisha as my backup; I may not reply right away in the morning but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ll check in. If I start to feel unsafe I will call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this \u2014 that took courage. Over the past two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating, finishing tasks, or making decisions (for example with schoolwork, sketching, or art\u2011school things)? Can you share a couple concrete examples, how often it\u2019s been happening, and whether it\u2019s getting in the way of day\u2011to\u2011day functioning?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 over the past two weeks I\u2019ve noticed trouble concentrating and making decisions, but it\u2019s intermittent rather than constant. It comes up several times a week, and it\u2019s definitely worse when I\u2019m tired, stressed, or caught up in comparing portfolios late at night while I\u2019m scrolling.\n\nConcrete examples: I missed an early art\u2011school deadline right after the move because I kept putting off finishing and submitting the pieces. I\u2019m procrastinating on portfolio edits more than I used to \u2014 a task that used to take an afternoon stretches into days. Picking which works to include takes me much longer now; I\u2019ll sit with the same six pieces and be unable to decide the order or which to cut, and small technical choices feel magnified and exhausting.\n\nDaytime functioning is largely intact \u2014 I\u2019m going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping my sketching hour most nights \u2014 but these lapses slow me down, lower the energy and quality of my work, and undermine momentum. It\u2019s frustrating because I can do the tasks in principle, but the extra time and indecision are making progress feel much harder than it should be.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and tiring, Maya. Over the past two weeks, have you felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 and how often (daily, several times a week)? Please give a couple concrete examples of how that low energy gets in the way of school, your caf\u00e9 shifts, or sketching; does rest or caffeine help at all, is it worse in the morning or evening, and on a scale from 0\u201310 how severe would you rate your typical energy loss?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 energy loss isn\u2019t a major problem for me right now. Daytime functioning is pretty intact: I\u2019m keeping up with school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping a nightly sketching habit most evenings. The main issue is these evening dips after poor sleep and rumination; when I\u2019m up late scrolling I get mentally drained and even a simple portfolio edit will drag on for hours. For example, picking and sequencing pieces that used to take me an afternoon now stretches over several nights, and an editing session that should be brisk becomes slow and fiddly once I\u2019m tired. Caffeine in the morning helps me feel alert for classes and shifts, and a short rest or a five\u2011minute sketch can reset me enough to keep going, but those things don\u2019t eliminate how vulnerable I feel at night. Overall I\u2019d rate typical energy loss about a 1 out of 10 \u2014 it\u2019s low most days, with the exception of those worse evenings.\nDoctor: Maya, thanks \u2014 that makes sense and I hear how evenings are the hardest. Lately have you been feeling unusually guilty or like you\u2019re a failure (for example blaming yourself for the missed deadline or for comparing yourself to others)? How often do those thoughts come up, can you give a couple concrete examples, do they get in the way of your day\u2011to\u2011day life, and how strong would you rate those feelings on a 0\u201310 scale?\nPatient: I don\u2019t feel unusually guilty or like a failure overall. Mostly it\u2019s occasional frustration or mild self\u2011reproach \u2014 a few times a week at most \u2014 and it\u2019s usually tied to evenings when I\u2019m tired or ruminating. For example, I\u2019ll blame myself briefly for missing that early art\u2011school deadline after the move, or get annoyed at myself for procrastinating on portfolio edits. Another example is feeling discouraged when I compare my work to others online and wonder if I\u2019ve already fallen behind.\n\nThose thoughts are irritating and they slow me down and sap motivation, but they don\u2019t stop me from going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, or keeping up my sketching routine. On a 0\u201310 scale I\u2019d put that feeling around a 1 out of 10 \u2014 present sometimes, but pretty mild and not pervasive.\nDoctor: Thank you \u2014 that\u2019s helpful to hear. Over the past two weeks, have you noticed being physically slowed down (moving, speaking, or thinking more slowly) or, on the other hand, feeling more fidgety or restless and unable to sit still? If so, can you give one or two concrete examples, say how often it happens, and whether roommates, classmates, or coworkers have noticed or it\u2019s gotten in the way of school or your caf\u00e9 shifts? Take your time.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t been noticeably slowed down during the day \u2014 I move and speak about the same and my thinking feels clear enough to get through classes and shifts. What I do notice is situational restlessness at night when I\u2019m up ruminating: a few nights a week I\u2019ll pace around the apartment, bounce my leg, or keep picking at something on the table and tapping it as a way to burn off the restless energy. Sometimes I feel a little mentally foggy the next morning after a really bad night of sleep and rumination, but that\u2019s pretty uncommon.\n\nMy roommates, classmates, and coworkers haven\u2019t really commented on any of this, and it hasn\u2019t meaningfully interfered with school or my caf\u00e9 shifts. It\u2019s mostly an evening thing that makes the nights feel longer and makes focusing on portfolio work harder.\nDoctor: I\u2019m sorry nights have been so rough, Maya \u2014 that sounds exhausting. Can you tell me: how long does it usually take you to fall asleep, do you have trouble staying asleep or wake up early, and roughly how many hours do you get most nights and how many nights per week this happens; do the ruminating thoughts keep you from falling asleep or wake you up, do you nap or use caffeine or any sleep aids, when did this pattern start, and how non\u2011restorative does your sleep feel \u2014 and if you like, I can go over some practical nighttime strategies after you describe it.\nPatient: Usually it takes me about an hour to two hours to fall asleep once I try to go to bed. I wake up several times most nights \u2014 typically two to four awakenings \u2014 and more often than not I end up scrolling when I wake, which drags the night out. I\u2019m getting roughly four to six hours total on most nights, about five to six nights a week. The rumination is the main problem: those looping thoughts keep me from falling asleep and then pull me awake during the night. I don\u2019t nap regularly, and I only use caffeine in the morning which helps for classes and shifts; I don\u2019t take prescription sleep aids. This pattern has gotten worse over the last few months since the move and missing deadlines. Sleep feels non\u2011restorative \u2014 mornings are usually okay, but after a really bad night I\u2019ll feel foggy and slower. I\u2019m open to trying practical nighttime strategies and would like concrete suggestions I can actually do.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve been doing a lot to cope already \u2014 that sleep pattern sounds really wearing. Tonight, a few concrete things to try: hand your phone to Riley and do a 30\u201360 minute no\u2011screen wind\u2011down (5\u2011minute doodle + the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding), if you can\u2019t fall asleep after ~20 minutes get up and do a short quiet sketch or a slow walk until you feel sleepy, enable an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter and keep caffeine to mornings, and try a consistent wake time plus a quick progressive muscle relaxation before bed. Which one or two of those feel most doable to try tonight, and would you like me to add them to the written plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll try the 30\u201360 minute no\u2011screen wind\u2011down tonight \u2014 starting with a five\u2011minute doodle and then the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding exercise. If I\u2019m still awake after about twenty minutes, I\u2019ll get up and do a short quiet sketch or take a slow walk until I feel sleepy. Riley holding my phone is the primary phone\u2011removal step and I\u2019ll enable an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter as a backup. Please add those exact steps to the written safety/sleep plan, and I\u2019d like progressive muscle relaxation and a consistent wake time included as optional strategies. The main barrier is the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement to hold the phone tonight makes handing it over feel doable, and I\u2019m willing to try these steps.\nDoctor: I\u2019ll add those exact steps to your written safety and sleep plan. Here\u2019s a one\u2011sentence progressive muscle relaxation cue you can use: \u201cSit or lie comfortably and, starting with your toes, tense each muscle group for 5\u20137 seconds then fully release while taking a slow breath, moving up through your body to your head\u201d; anything else you\u2019d like included?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 please include the progressive muscle relaxation cue exactly as written: \u201cSit or lie comfortably and, starting with your toes, tense each muscle group for 5\u20137 seconds then fully release while taking a slow breath, moving up through your body to your head.\u201d  \n\nAlso add progressive muscle relaxation and a consistent wake time as optional strategies to the written plan. Please note Riley will hold my phone tonight and Aisha is my backup, and include the local crisis number and 988. Please keep the sleep and safety steps exactly as we discussed: a five\u2011minute doodle, the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding exercise, the ~20\u2011minute get\u2011up rule with a short quiet sketch or slow walk if still awake, and an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter as a backup.  \n\nThanks again \u2014 I appreciate you putting this together.\nDoctor: Maya, you\u2019ve been really thorough \u2014 thank you. Over the past two weeks have you been eating more or less than usual, noticed any unintentional weight change, or had changes in appetite (skipping meals, stronger cravings, or nausea)? If so, can you give one or two brief examples, say how often it\u2019s happening, whether it\u2019s affecting school or work, if you\u2019re dieting or on any meds that might explain it, and rate how much of a problem this is from 0\u201310?\nPatient: Appetite changes have been pretty rare and mild. A few times over the past couple of weeks I skipped breakfast after a bad night of sleep and rumination, and sometimes I eat a bit less in the evening when I\u2019m not feeling up to a full meal, but it\u2019s not a regular pattern. I haven\u2019t noticed any unintentional weight change, I\u2019m not dieting, and I\u2019m not taking any medications that would explain appetite shifts. It hasn\u2019t affected school or my caf\u00e9 shifts. On a 0\u201310 scale I\u2019d rate this about a 1 out of 10.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that\u2019s helpful. Over the past two weeks, how often have you felt little interest or pleasure in things you usually enjoy (every day, most days, or several times a week)? Can you give a couple concrete examples (like sketching, looking at others\u2019 work, or hanging out with friends), tell me if you ever still feel any enjoyment when you do those things, rate how much this loss of interest interferes with your life from 0\u201310, and whether it\u2019s worse at certain times of day (evenings, for example)?\nPatient: Most days lately I notice a diminished interest in things I used to enjoy, especially in the evenings. Sketching has become more of a routine task than something that lights me up \u2014 I still draw because it\u2019s part of my day, but it often feels hollow and mechanical. Browsing other students\u2019 portfolios online tends to trigger comparison and demotivation instead of inspiration, and when I hang out with friends I\u2019m there but the conversations feel flatter and less engaging than they used to. I do still get small moments of pleasure sometimes \u2014 a quick sketch that goes well or a really good conversation can brighten me briefly \u2014 so it\u2019s not complete numbness. Overall I\u2019d say this loss of interest interferes with my life at about a 6 out of 10: it slows down portfolio work, makes decision\u2011making harder, and saps momentum even though I\u2019m still keeping up with school and shifts. It\u2019s definitely worse at night when I\u2019m tired and ruminating.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nMost days lately I notice a diminished interest in things I used to enjoy, especially in the evenings.

I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave. I\u2019ll send the exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988, and it\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t reply right away. Please lean on Riley or Aisha tonight, and if you feel unsafe at any point call 988, your local crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency department.\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 I appreciate the support and the check\u2011in. That text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988 included is fine. I\u2019ll lean on Riley tonight with the phone held and Aisha as my backup; I may not reply right away in the morning but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ll check in. If I start to feel unsafe I will call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this \u2014 that took courage. Over the past two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating, finishing tasks, or making decisions (for example with schoolwork, sketching, or art\u2011school things)? Can you share a couple concrete examples, how often it\u2019s been happening, and whether it\u2019s getting in the way of day\u2011to\u2011day functioning?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 over the past two weeks I\u2019ve noticed trouble concentrating and making decisions, but it\u2019s intermittent rather than constant. It comes up several times a week, and it\u2019s definitely worse when I\u2019m tired, stressed, or caught up in comparing portfolios late at night while I\u2019m scrolling.\n\nConcrete examples: I missed an early art\u2011school deadline right after the move because I kept putting off finishing and submitting the pieces. I\u2019m procrastinating on portfolio edits more than I used to \u2014 a task that used to take an afternoon stretches into days. Picking which works to include takes me much longer now; I\u2019ll sit with the same six pieces and be unable to decide the order or which to cut, and small technical choices feel magnified and exhausting.\n\nDaytime functioning is largely intact \u2014 I\u2019m going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping my sketching hour most nights \u2014 but these lapses slow me down, lower the energy and quality of my work, and undermine momentum. It\u2019s frustrating because I can do the tasks in principle, but the extra time and indecision are making progress feel much harder than it should be.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and tiring, Maya. Over the past two weeks, have you felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 and how often (daily, several times a week)? Please give a couple concrete examples of how that low energy gets in the way of school, your caf\u00e9 shifts, or sketching; does rest or caffeine help at all, is it worse in the morning or evening, and on a scale from 0\u201310 how severe would you rate your typical energy loss?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 energy loss isn\u2019t a major problem for me right now. Daytime functioning is pretty intact: I\u2019m keeping up with school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping a nightly sketching habit most evenings. The main issue is these evening dips after poor sleep and rumination; when I\u2019m up late scrolling I get mentally drained and even a simple portfolio edit will drag on for hours. For example, picking and sequencing pieces that used to take me an afternoon now stretches over several nights, and an editing session that should be brisk becomes slow and fiddly once I\u2019m tired. Caffeine in the morning helps me feel alert for classes and shifts, and a short rest or a five\u2011minute sketch can reset me enough to keep going, but those things don\u2019t eliminate how vulnerable I feel at night. Overall I\u2019d rate typical energy loss about a 1 out of 10 \u2014 it\u2019s low most days, with the exception of those worse evenings.\nDoctor: Maya, thanks \u2014 that makes sense and I hear how evenings are the hardest. Lately have you been feeling unusually guilty or like you\u2019re a failure (for example blaming yourself for the missed deadline or for comparing yourself to others)? How often do those thoughts come up, can you give a couple concrete examples, do they get in the way of your day\u2011to\u2011day life, and how strong would you rate those feelings on a 0\u201310 scale?\nPatient: I don\u2019t feel unusually guilty or like a failure overall. Mostly it\u2019s occasional frustration or mild self\u2011reproach \u2014 a few times a week at most \u2014 and it\u2019s usually tied to evenings when I\u2019m tired or ruminating. For example, I\u2019ll blame myself briefly for missing that early art\u2011school deadline after the move, or get annoyed at myself for procrastinating on portfolio edits. Another example is feeling discouraged when I compare my work to others online and wonder if I\u2019ve already fallen behind.\n\nThose thoughts are irritating and they slow me down and sap motivation, but they don\u2019t stop me from going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, or keeping up my sketching routine. On a 0\u201310 scale I\u2019d put that feeling around a 1 out of 10 \u2014 present sometimes, but pretty mild and not pervasive.\nDoctor: Thank you \u2014 that\u2019s helpful to hear. Over the past two weeks, have you noticed being physically slowed down (moving, speaking, or thinking more slowly) or, on the other hand, feeling more fidgety or restless and unable to sit still? If so, can you give one or two concrete examples, say how often it happens, and whether roommates, classmates, or coworkers have noticed or it\u2019s gotten in the way of school or your caf\u00e9 shifts? Take your time.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t been noticeably slowed down during the day \u2014 I move and speak about the same and my thinking feels clear enough to get through classes and shifts. What I do notice is situational restlessness at night when I\u2019m up ruminating: a few nights a week I\u2019ll pace around the apartment, bounce my leg, or keep picking at something on the table and tapping it as a way to burn off the restless energy. Sometimes I feel a little mentally foggy the next morning after a really bad night of sleep and rumination, but that\u2019s pretty uncommon.\n\nMy roommates, classmates, and coworkers haven\u2019t really commented on any of this, and it hasn\u2019t meaningfully interfered with school or my caf\u00e9 shifts. It\u2019s mostly an evening thing that makes the nights feel longer and makes focusing on portfolio work harder.\nDoctor: I\u2019m sorry nights have been so rough, Maya \u2014 that sounds exhausting. Can you tell me: how long does it usually take you to fall asleep, do you have trouble staying asleep or wake up early, and roughly how many hours do you get most nights and how many nights per week this happens; do the ruminating thoughts keep you from falling asleep or wake you up, do you nap or use caffeine or any sleep aids, when did this pattern start, and how non\u2011restorative does your sleep feel \u2014 and if you like, I can go over some practical nighttime strategies after you describe it.\nPatient: Usually it takes me about an hour to two hours to fall asleep once I try to go to bed. I wake up several times most nights \u2014 typically two to four awakenings \u2014 and more often than not I end up scrolling when I wake, which drags the night out. I\u2019m getting roughly four to six hours total on most nights, about five to six nights a week. The rumination is the main problem: those looping thoughts keep me from falling asleep and then pull me awake during the night. I don\u2019t nap regularly, and I only use caffeine in the morning which helps for classes and shifts; I don\u2019t take prescription sleep aids. This pattern has gotten worse over the last few months since the move and missing deadlines. Sleep feels non\u2011restorative \u2014 mornings are usually okay, but after a really bad night I\u2019ll feel foggy and slower. I\u2019m open to trying practical nighttime strategies and would like concrete suggestions I can actually do.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve been doing a lot to cope already \u2014 that sleep pattern sounds really wearing. Tonight, a few concrete things to try: hand your phone to Riley and do a 30\u201360 minute no\u2011screen wind\u2011down (5\u2011minute doodle + the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding), if you can\u2019t fall asleep after ~20 minutes get up and do a short quiet sketch or a slow walk until you feel sleepy, enable an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter and keep caffeine to mornings, and try a consistent wake time plus a quick progressive muscle relaxation before bed. Which one or two of those feel most doable to try tonight, and would you like me to add them to the written plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll try the 30\u201360 minute no\u2011screen wind\u2011down tonight \u2014 starting with a five\u2011minute doodle and then the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding exercise. If I\u2019m still awake after about twenty minutes, I\u2019ll get up and do a short quiet sketch or take a slow walk until I feel sleepy. Riley holding my phone is the primary phone\u2011removal step and I\u2019ll enable an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter as a backup. Please add those exact steps to the written safety/sleep plan, and I\u2019d like progressive muscle relaxation and a consistent wake time included as optional strategies. The main barrier is the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement to hold the phone tonight makes handing it over feel doable, and I\u2019m willing to try these steps.\nDoctor: I\u2019ll add those exact steps to your written safety and sleep plan. Here\u2019s a one\u2011sentence progressive muscle relaxation cue you can use: \u201cSit or lie comfortably and, starting with your toes, tense each muscle group for 5\u20137 seconds then fully release while taking a slow breath, moving up through your body to your head\u201d; anything else you\u2019d like included?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 please include the progressive muscle relaxation cue exactly as written: \u201cSit or lie comfortably and, starting with your toes, tense each muscle group for 5\u20137 seconds then fully release while taking a slow breath, moving up through your body to your head.\u201d  \n\nAlso add progressive muscle relaxation and a consistent wake time as optional strategies to the written plan. Please note Riley will hold my phone tonight and Aisha is my backup, and include the local crisis number and 988. Please keep the sleep and safety steps exactly as we discussed: a five\u2011minute doodle, the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding exercise, the ~20\u2011minute get\u2011up rule with a short quiet sketch or slow walk if still awake, and an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter as a backup.  \n\nThanks again \u2014 I appreciate you putting this together.\nDoctor: Maya, you\u2019ve been really thorough \u2014 thank you. Over the past two weeks have you been eating more or less than usual, noticed any unintentional weight change, or had changes in appetite (skipping meals, stronger cravings, or nausea)? If so, can you give one or two brief examples, say how often it\u2019s happening, whether it\u2019s affecting school or work, if you\u2019re dieting or on any meds that might explain it, and rate how much of a problem this is from 0\u201310?\nPatient: Appetite changes have been pretty rare and mild. A few times over the past couple of weeks I skipped breakfast after a bad night of sleep and rumination, and sometimes I eat a bit less in the evening when I\u2019m not feeling up to a full meal, but it\u2019s not a regular pattern. I haven\u2019t noticed any unintentional weight change, I\u2019m not dieting, and I\u2019m not taking any medications that would explain appetite shifts. It hasn\u2019t affected school or my caf\u00e9 shifts. On a 0\u201310 scale I\u2019d rate this about a 1 out of 10.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that\u2019s helpful. Over the past two weeks, how often have you felt little interest or pleasure in things you usually enjoy (every day, most days, or several times a week)? Can you give a couple concrete examples (like sketching, looking at others\u2019 work, or hanging out with friends), tell me if you ever still feel any enjoyment when you do those things, rate how much this loss of interest interferes with your life from 0\u201310, and whether it\u2019s worse at certain times of day (evenings, for example)?\nPatient: Most days lately I notice a diminished interest in things I used to enjoy, especially in the evenings. Sketching has become more of a routine task than something that lights me up \u2014 I still draw because it\u2019s part of my day, but it often feels hollow and mechanical. Browsing other students\u2019 portfolios online tends to trigger comparison and demotivation instead of inspiration, and when I hang out with friends I\u2019m there but the conversations feel flatter and less engaging than they used to. I do still get small moments of pleasure sometimes \u2014 a quick sketch that goes well or a really good conversation can brighten me briefly \u2014 so it\u2019s not complete numbness. Overall I\u2019d say this loss of interest interferes with my life at about a 6 out of 10: it slows down portfolio work, makes decision\u2011making harder, and saps momentum even though I\u2019m still keeping up with school and shifts. It\u2019s definitely worse at night when I\u2019m tired and ruminating.\nDoctor: That sounds really draining, Maya \u2014 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been so heavy. How often do those brief moments of pleasure happen (daily, several times a week), and can you give one recent example of something that actually felt enjoyable and what about it helped? Has this loss of interest worsened since the move/missed deadlines or is it mainly tied to evenings, and is there anything else that still brings you a little enjoyment?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat sounds really draining, Maya \u2014 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been so heavy.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Thanks for asking. I\u2019ve been feeling low most days lately \u2014 it\u2019s been a quiet, persistent sort of sadness rather than something that spikes suddenly. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of the things that used to make me feel like myself, like sketching for fun or getting excited about other people\u2019s work; I still draw because it\u2019s part of my routine, but it doesn\u2019t give me the same pleasure.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I wake up at night a lot and end up scrolling portfolios and feeds, which just makes the comparison and stuck feeling worse. Those nights are when thoughts about death come up fairly often, but I won\u2019t go into graphic detail right now. Even so, I\u2019m still getting through school, working my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching when I can \u2014 I look functional from the outside, but it\u2019s been a real struggle to find momentum. The recent move and missing early application deadlines for art school make everything feel more uncertain, and that\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\nI\u2019m willing to talk more about this.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and I appreciate you telling me \u2014 that takes a lot. You mentioned thoughts about death at night \u2014 how often do they come up and what are they like when they happen? Take your time answering; you can share as much as you\u2019re comfortable with. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or making a plan, do you have access to anything that could be used, and do you feel safe right now?\nPatient: They come up most nights, usually when I\u2019m awake and scrolling late \u2014 it\u2019s more like a quiet, looping thought wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear, not vivid images or anything graphic. I don\u2019t have a plan or intent and I haven\u2019t taken any steps toward hurting myself. I also don\u2019t have ready access to weapons or other lethal means where I\u2019m living now. Generally I can get through school, my caf\u00e9 shift, and sketching during the day, but nights are worse and I feel more vulnerable then, like I\u2019m less safe when I\u2019m alone and tired. I\u2019m not in immediate danger right now and I want support \u2014 I want to feel safer and to understand why this keeps happening. I\u2019m willing to talk more and work on ways to make the nights easier.\nDoctor: Maya, thank you \u2014 that was really brave to share, and I want you to know I take these nightly, passive thoughts seriously. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or intentionally self\u2011harmed in the past, and do you currently use alcohol or drugs? Are there prescription medications or other potentially dangerous items in the home where you\u2019re staying now?  \n\nWho might you be able to call or be with at night when you feel vulnerable, what has helped calm you before, and would you be open to making a short safety plan together now (for example, naming someone to alert, removing any means, and listing a few specific coping steps you can try when those thoughts start)? Take your time \u2014 answer whatever feels okay.\nPatient: I\u2019ve never tried to hurt myself or engaged in intentional self\u2011harm in the past. The thoughts about death come up most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling; they\u2019re passive ruminations \u2014 wishing I wouldn\u2019t wake up or that I could disappear \u2014 not vivid or planned. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to weapons where I\u2019m staying. There are prescription medications in the apartment for my roommates, but I don\u2019t use them, and I don\u2019t have a personal stash or ready access to large quantities. I don\u2019t use recreational drugs and I only drink rarely, not as a way to cope.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling vulnerable at night there are people I could reach out to: my roommate, who is usually around in the evenings, and my close friend Aisha \u2014 I can text or call her. I also know I could contact a crisis line if it got to that point. Things that have helped before are doing a very short sketch or doodle to ground myself, simple breathing or grounding exercises, talking with someone, or moving to a more public place like going in for a caf\u00e9 shift when I\u2019m really low.\n\nI\u2019m willing to make a short safety plan now and try concrete steps to make nights safer. I can move devices out of my bedroom or leave my phone with my roommate, write a short list of coping steps and people to contact, and try the quick sketching and grounding exercises immediately when the thoughts start. I want to feel safer and I\u2019m ready to try these steps.\nDoctor: That sounds really brave and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for being so specific. Who exactly will you contact (your roommate, Aisha, or both) and how would you prefer to reach them (call, text, or just knock on their door)? Would your roommate be willing tonight to keep your phone/room access or put their medications out of easy reach? Please name three very short coping steps you\u2019ll try first (for example: one quick sketch, a 5\u2011minute grounding exercise, or going into the caf\u00e9), and tell me if you see any barriers to doing these tonight \u2014 do you feel safe right now and are you comfortable moving forward with this plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll contact my roommate Riley first \u2014 I\u2019ll knock or call them if they\u2019re home, and if I can\u2019t reach Riley I\u2019ll text or call Aisha. Riley is usually around in the evenings and has agreed tonight to hold my phone and to keep their medications out of easy reach.\n\nThe three things I\u2019ll try right away are a very quick five\u2011minute sketch or doodle to ground myself, a five\u2011minute grounding exercise using 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 with slow breaths, and if that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll move to a more public place \u2014 either go into my caf\u00e9 shift if the timing works or leave the apartment to be with Riley or call/text Aisha. The main barrier for me is the urge to keep scrolling and how hard it is to hand over my phone when those thoughts start, and I worry about nights when Riley might not be home. \n\nI feel reasonably safe right now and I\u2019m comfortable moving forward with this short safety plan. These thoughts happen most nights when I\u2019m awake and scrolling, and having these concrete steps and people in place makes me feel more able to manage them. I\u2019m ready to try it.\nDoctor: That plan is really thoughtful and practical, Maya \u2014 thank you for how carefully you\u2019ve put it together; if Riley isn\u2019t home, is Aisha your backup contact?  \n\nCould you pick one concrete phone\u2011removal step to try tonight (leave it charging in the living room, hand it to Riley, or use an app blocker) \u2014 which feels most doable for you?  \n\nI can write a very short safety plan now with those names and steps, and would you like a quick check\u2011in by text or call after the first night to see how it went?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 Aisha is my backup contact if Riley isn\u2019t home. Tonight I\u2019ll hand my phone to Riley since they agreed to hold it; that feels like the most concrete step I can take to stop scrolling when the thoughts start. If Riley ends up not being available, my fallback is to leave my phone charging in the living room and/or enable an app blocker, then text or call Aisha right away.\n\nI\u2019ll accept a brief check\u2011in after the first night and prefer a text. Handing the phone over is hard for me because of the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement makes it feel doable tonight, and having the backup plan with Aisha helps me feel safer moving forward.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 thank you, that\u2019s really responsible and brave. Riley will hold your phone tonight, Aisha is your backup, and you\u2019d like a brief text check\u2011in \u2014 what time should I send that? On a scale of 0\u201310, how safe do you feel right now, and would you like me to add crisis numbers (e.g., a local crisis line or 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S.) to your written plan?\nPatient: 9:00 AM is a good time for the text check\u2011in. Right now I\u2019d rate my safety about a 6 out of 10 \u2014 reasonably safe during the day but definitely more vulnerable at night. Yes, please add crisis numbers to the written plan, including the local crisis line and 988. I\u2019m willing to proceed with the plan and I appreciate the check\u2011in; having Riley hold my phone tonight and Aisha as backup already makes me feel more able to manage the nights.\nDoctor: That sounds clear and helpful, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send a brief supportive text at 9:00 AM; which phone number would you like me to use? Would you like me to include the local crisis number and 988 in that text or keep them only in the written plan, and is it okay if I try reaching out again if I don\u2019t get a reply? Riley holding your phone tonight and Aisha as backup are really good supports \u2014 I\u2019m glad you have them.\nPatient: Please use my cell number on file as the best contact. 9:00 AM works for the brief check\u2011in. Please include both the local crisis number and 988 in that text. It\u2019s okay for you to try reaching me again if I don\u2019t reply. Thank you for checking in \u2014 I really appreciate it.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 I\u2019ll send that brief supportive text at 9:00 AM to your cell with the local crisis number and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if I don\u2019t hear back. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports tonight \u2014 is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to say in the message or anything else I should know before tonight? If you start to feel unsafe at any point, please call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department right away.\nPatient: Thanks \u2014 please keep the text very short and supportive, something like: \"Hope you slept okay \u2014 remember Riley is holding your phone tonight and Aisha is your backup. If you need extra support, local crisis line [local number] or 988 are available.\" Please include both the local crisis number and 988. It\u2019s fine to try again if I don\u2019t reply; I may not respond right away, but I really appreciate the check\u2011in.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that wording is perfect. I\u2019ll send that exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file, include both the local crisis line and 988, and I\u2019ll try again if you don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m really glad you have Riley and Aisha as supports \u2014 is there anything else you\u2019d like included or any last concern before tonight?\nPatient: That wording is fine \u2014 nothing else to add. Thank you for checking in and for sending the text. I may not reply right away in the morning, but I appreciate the support and I\u2019m ready to proceed with the plan tonight.\nDoctor: Maya \u2014 I\u2019m really proud of how carefully you put this plan together; that was brave. I\u2019ll send the exact short text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988, and it\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t reply right away. Please lean on Riley or Aisha tonight, and if you feel unsafe at any point call 988, your local crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency department.\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 I appreciate the support and the check\u2011in. That text at 9:00 AM to the cell on file with the local crisis number and 988 included is fine. I\u2019ll lean on Riley tonight with the phone held and Aisha as my backup; I may not reply right away in the morning but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ll check in. If I start to feel unsafe I will call 988 or go to the nearest emergency department.\nDoctor: Maya, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this \u2014 that took courage. Over the past two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating, finishing tasks, or making decisions (for example with schoolwork, sketching, or art\u2011school things)? Can you share a couple concrete examples, how often it\u2019s been happening, and whether it\u2019s getting in the way of day\u2011to\u2011day functioning?\nPatient: Yes \u2014 over the past two weeks I\u2019ve noticed trouble concentrating and making decisions, but it\u2019s intermittent rather than constant. It comes up several times a week, and it\u2019s definitely worse when I\u2019m tired, stressed, or caught up in comparing portfolios late at night while I\u2019m scrolling.\n\nConcrete examples: I missed an early art\u2011school deadline right after the move because I kept putting off finishing and submitting the pieces. I\u2019m procrastinating on portfolio edits more than I used to \u2014 a task that used to take an afternoon stretches into days. Picking which works to include takes me much longer now; I\u2019ll sit with the same six pieces and be unable to decide the order or which to cut, and small technical choices feel magnified and exhausting.\n\nDaytime functioning is largely intact \u2014 I\u2019m going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping my sketching hour most nights \u2014 but these lapses slow me down, lower the energy and quality of my work, and undermine momentum. It\u2019s frustrating because I can do the tasks in principle, but the extra time and indecision are making progress feel much harder than it should be.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating and tiring, Maya. Over the past two weeks, have you felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 and how often (daily, several times a week)? Please give a couple concrete examples of how that low energy gets in the way of school, your caf\u00e9 shifts, or sketching; does rest or caffeine help at all, is it worse in the morning or evening, and on a scale from 0\u201310 how severe would you rate your typical energy loss?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t felt unusually tired or lacking energy most days \u2014 energy loss isn\u2019t a major problem for me right now. Daytime functioning is pretty intact: I\u2019m keeping up with school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, and keeping a nightly sketching habit most evenings. The main issue is these evening dips after poor sleep and rumination; when I\u2019m up late scrolling I get mentally drained and even a simple portfolio edit will drag on for hours. For example, picking and sequencing pieces that used to take me an afternoon now stretches over several nights, and an editing session that should be brisk becomes slow and fiddly once I\u2019m tired. Caffeine in the morning helps me feel alert for classes and shifts, and a short rest or a five\u2011minute sketch can reset me enough to keep going, but those things don\u2019t eliminate how vulnerable I feel at night. Overall I\u2019d rate typical energy loss about a 1 out of 10 \u2014 it\u2019s low most days, with the exception of those worse evenings.\nDoctor: Maya, thanks \u2014 that makes sense and I hear how evenings are the hardest. Lately have you been feeling unusually guilty or like you\u2019re a failure (for example blaming yourself for the missed deadline or for comparing yourself to others)? How often do those thoughts come up, can you give a couple concrete examples, do they get in the way of your day\u2011to\u2011day life, and how strong would you rate those feelings on a 0\u201310 scale?\nPatient: I don\u2019t feel unusually guilty or like a failure overall. Mostly it\u2019s occasional frustration or mild self\u2011reproach \u2014 a few times a week at most \u2014 and it\u2019s usually tied to evenings when I\u2019m tired or ruminating. For example, I\u2019ll blame myself briefly for missing that early art\u2011school deadline after the move, or get annoyed at myself for procrastinating on portfolio edits. Another example is feeling discouraged when I compare my work to others online and wonder if I\u2019ve already fallen behind.\n\nThose thoughts are irritating and they slow me down and sap motivation, but they don\u2019t stop me from going to school, doing my caf\u00e9 shifts, or keeping up my sketching routine. On a 0\u201310 scale I\u2019d put that feeling around a 1 out of 10 \u2014 present sometimes, but pretty mild and not pervasive.\nDoctor: Thank you \u2014 that\u2019s helpful to hear. Over the past two weeks, have you noticed being physically slowed down (moving, speaking, or thinking more slowly) or, on the other hand, feeling more fidgety or restless and unable to sit still? If so, can you give one or two concrete examples, say how often it happens, and whether roommates, classmates, or coworkers have noticed or it\u2019s gotten in the way of school or your caf\u00e9 shifts? Take your time.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t been noticeably slowed down during the day \u2014 I move and speak about the same and my thinking feels clear enough to get through classes and shifts. What I do notice is situational restlessness at night when I\u2019m up ruminating: a few nights a week I\u2019ll pace around the apartment, bounce my leg, or keep picking at something on the table and tapping it as a way to burn off the restless energy. Sometimes I feel a little mentally foggy the next morning after a really bad night of sleep and rumination, but that\u2019s pretty uncommon.\n\nMy roommates, classmates, and coworkers haven\u2019t really commented on any of this, and it hasn\u2019t meaningfully interfered with school or my caf\u00e9 shifts. It\u2019s mostly an evening thing that makes the nights feel longer and makes focusing on portfolio work harder.\nDoctor: I\u2019m sorry nights have been so rough, Maya \u2014 that sounds exhausting. Can you tell me: how long does it usually take you to fall asleep, do you have trouble staying asleep or wake up early, and roughly how many hours do you get most nights and how many nights per week this happens; do the ruminating thoughts keep you from falling asleep or wake you up, do you nap or use caffeine or any sleep aids, when did this pattern start, and how non\u2011restorative does your sleep feel \u2014 and if you like, I can go over some practical nighttime strategies after you describe it.\nPatient: Usually it takes me about an hour to two hours to fall asleep once I try to go to bed. I wake up several times most nights \u2014 typically two to four awakenings \u2014 and more often than not I end up scrolling when I wake, which drags the night out. I\u2019m getting roughly four to six hours total on most nights, about five to six nights a week. The rumination is the main problem: those looping thoughts keep me from falling asleep and then pull me awake during the night. I don\u2019t nap regularly, and I only use caffeine in the morning which helps for classes and shifts; I don\u2019t take prescription sleep aids. This pattern has gotten worse over the last few months since the move and missing deadlines. Sleep feels non\u2011restorative \u2014 mornings are usually okay, but after a really bad night I\u2019ll feel foggy and slower. I\u2019m open to trying practical nighttime strategies and would like concrete suggestions I can actually do.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve been doing a lot to cope already \u2014 that sleep pattern sounds really wearing. Tonight, a few concrete things to try: hand your phone to Riley and do a 30\u201360 minute no\u2011screen wind\u2011down (5\u2011minute doodle + the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding), if you can\u2019t fall asleep after ~20 minutes get up and do a short quiet sketch or a slow walk until you feel sleepy, enable an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter and keep caffeine to mornings, and try a consistent wake time plus a quick progressive muscle relaxation before bed. Which one or two of those feel most doable to try tonight, and would you like me to add them to the written plan?\nPatient: I\u2019ll try the 30\u201360 minute no\u2011screen wind\u2011down tonight \u2014 starting with a five\u2011minute doodle and then the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding exercise. If I\u2019m still awake after about twenty minutes, I\u2019ll get up and do a short quiet sketch or take a slow walk until I feel sleepy. Riley holding my phone is the primary phone\u2011removal step and I\u2019ll enable an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter as a backup. Please add those exact steps to the written safety/sleep plan, and I\u2019d like progressive muscle relaxation and a consistent wake time included as optional strategies. The main barrier is the urge to keep scrolling, but Riley\u2019s agreement to hold the phone tonight makes handing it over feel doable, and I\u2019m willing to try these steps.\nDoctor: I\u2019ll add those exact steps to your written safety and sleep plan. Here\u2019s a one\u2011sentence progressive muscle relaxation cue you can use: \u201cSit or lie comfortably and, starting with your toes, tense each muscle group for 5\u20137 seconds then fully release while taking a slow breath, moving up through your body to your head\u201d; anything else you\u2019d like included?\nPatient: Thank you \u2014 please include the progressive muscle relaxation cue exactly as written: \u201cSit or lie comfortably and, starting with your toes, tense each muscle group for 5\u20137 seconds then fully release while taking a slow breath, moving up through your body to your head.\u201d  \n\nAlso add progressive muscle relaxation and a consistent wake time as optional strategies to the written plan. Please note Riley will hold my phone tonight and Aisha is my backup, and include the local crisis number and 988. Please keep the sleep and safety steps exactly as we discussed: a five\u2011minute doodle, the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding exercise, the ~20\u2011minute get\u2011up rule with a short quiet sketch or slow walk if still awake, and an app\u2011blocker/blue\u2011light filter as a backup.  \n\nThanks again \u2014 I appreciate you putting this together.\nDoctor: Maya, you\u2019ve been really thorough \u2014 thank you. Over the past two weeks have you been eating more or less than usual, noticed any unintentional weight change, or had changes in appetite (skipping meals, stronger cravings, or nausea)? If so, can you give one or two brief examples, say how often it\u2019s happening, whether it\u2019s affecting school or work, if you\u2019re dieting or on any meds that might explain it, and rate how much of a problem this is from 0\u201310?\nPatient: Appetite changes have been pretty rare and mild. A few times over the past couple of weeks I skipped breakfast after a bad night of sleep and rumination, and sometimes I eat a bit less in the evening when I\u2019m not feeling up to a full meal, but it\u2019s not a regular pattern. I haven\u2019t noticed any unintentional weight change, I\u2019m not dieting, and I\u2019m not taking any medications that would explain appetite shifts. It hasn\u2019t affected school or my caf\u00e9 shifts. On a 0\u201310 scale I\u2019d rate this about a 1 out of 10.\nDoctor: Thanks, Maya \u2014 that\u2019s helpful. Over the past two weeks, how often have you felt little interest or pleasure in things you usually enjoy (every day, most days, or several times a week)? Can you give a couple concrete examples (like sketching, looking at others\u2019 work, or hanging out with friends), tell me if you ever still feel any enjoyment when you do those things, rate how much this loss of interest interferes with your life from 0\u201310, and whether it\u2019s worse at certain times of day (evenings, for example)?\nPatient: Most days lately I notice a diminished interest in things I used to enjoy, especially in the evenings. Sketching has become more of a routine task than something that lights me up \u2014 I still draw because it\u2019s part of my day, but it often feels hollow and mechanical. Browsing other students\u2019 portfolios online tends to trigger comparison and demotivation instead of inspiration, and when I hang out with friends I\u2019m there but the conversations feel flatter and less engaging than they used to. I do still get small moments of pleasure sometimes \u2014 a quick sketch that goes well or a really good conversation can brighten me briefly \u2014 so it\u2019s not complete numbness. Overall I\u2019d say this loss of interest interferes with my life at about a 6 out of 10: it slows down portfolio work, makes decision\u2011making harder, and saps momentum even though I\u2019m still keeping up with school and shifts. It\u2019s definitely worse at night when I\u2019m tired and ruminating.\nDoctor: That sounds really draining, Maya \u2014 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been so heavy. How often do those brief moments of pleasure happen (daily, several times a week), and can you give one recent example of something that actually felt enjoyable and what about it helped? Has this loss of interest worsened since the move/missed deadlines or is it mainly tied to evenings, and is there anything else that still brings you a little enjoyment?\nPatient: They happen several times a week and some days I\u2019ll get a small lift \u2014 maybe once that day. A recent example was a quick sketch I did between classes: I hit a sweet spot where the lines felt right, the textures came together, and I got this brief sense of flow and visible result that actually lifted me for an hour. Another example was a late\u2011night call with Aisha where the conversation felt genuinely connecting \u2014 not forced \u2014 and I walked away oddly lighter for the rest of the evening.\n\nThe loss of interest has definitely deepened since the move and missing those early deadlines, and it\u2019s most pronounced in the evenings when I\u2019m tired and ruminating. Still, little things help: parts of my caf\u00e9 shift (the routine, people\u2011watching), short walks outside, and getting a quick compliment or positive feedback on a piece can give me a small boost. Those moments are fleeting but meaningful \u2014 they\u2019re what keep me going \u2014 and I\u2019m willing to try the sleep and safety strategies we talked about to try to make more of them happen.\nDoctor: That makes sense \u2014 those small lifts matter, and it\u2019s good you notice them. Over the past two weeks, how often have you felt down, sad, or empty for most of the day (every day, most days, several times a week), and would you say those feelings are fairly constant or they come and go?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat makes sense \u2014 those small lifts matter, and it\u2019s good you notice them.
