Other times, I'm caught in this loop of worrying whether I've disappointed the people around me, which is exhausting.\n\nUnfortunately, sleep hasn't been great\u2014I find myself lying awake worrying about things. The worry keeps me up, and then fatigue follows me around. It makes me feel like I'm constantly running on empty. However, these doubts and guilt seem almost never-ending, which just adds to it all.\n\nOutside of these feelings, my routine feels a little unstable, which doesn't help much either. But I'm managing the best I can, I suppose."

    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "My sleep has been quite inconsistent. I often find myself lying awake because I\u2019m stuck thinking and worrying about various things, especially at night. It sometimes takes forever to fall asleep, and when I do, I often wake up frequently. \n\nOverall, on many nights I don't really feel rested, and it seems like the lack of quality sleep is affecting my energy levels throughout the day. It\u2019s quite challenging\u2014I'm hoping to find some way to improve this soon."

      "content": "Yes, I\u2019ve definitely noticed a mix of both. There are times when I feel really sluggish\u2014like my body is just heavy and it's hard to get going with anything. Other times, I feel this restlessness; I\u2019m on edge but can't channel that energy productively. \n\nIt's like I'm caught between feeling immobilized and overly wired, and it's just draining. I think it's largely connected to those relentless thoughts and worries."

    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yes, I have. It's been quite difficult to focus because my mind is constantly clouded with worries about whether I'm letting others down or not doing enough. \n\nMaking decisions feels overwhelming, too. Even small choices require extra effort, and I second-guess myself a lot. It\u2019s frustrating, as everything takes longer and adds to the mental fatigue."

      "role": "assistant",

    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yes, that's been happening quite a bit. I often feel like I\u2019m not doing enough or living up to expectations, and it results in this overwhelming sense of guilt. It\u2019s hard not to feel like I'm failing loved ones or somehow not being who I should be for them. \n\nThese feelings are quite persistent and add to the overall fatigue. It\u2019s difficult to shake off, no matter how much I tell myself otherwise."
