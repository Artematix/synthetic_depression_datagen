I find myself quite tired more often, even after what should be enough rest. Some nights, I just can\u2019t seem to settle into sleep properly, which only makes the tiredness worse during the day. A lot of this, I think, comes from feeling this ongoing pressure to stay accountable for the wellbeing of those I care for, both at work and at home. It\u2019s like there\u2019s no room to pause because I\u2019m always worried about whether I\u2019m doing enough or if something might slip through the cracks.

Still, at the end of the day, that pressure doesn\u2019t just disappear. It often leads to a restless mind when I\u2019m trying to sleep, with worries and thoughts running over again. Balancing my own needs with everyone else\u2019s feels like a constant challenge, and I\u2019m aware of it even as I push to maintain some stability.

That restlessness makes the sleep I do get feel broken and not very refreshing. Even when I get a decent number of hours, I often don\u2019t feel fully rested in the morning, which just adds to the sense of fatigue during the day.

I find myself quite tired more often, even after what should be enough rest. Some nights, I just can\u2019t seem to settle into sleep properly, which only makes the tiredness worse during the day. A lot of this, I think, comes from feeling this ongoing pressure to stay accountable for the wellbeing of those I care for, both at work and at home. It\u2019s like there\u2019s no room to pause because I\u2019m always worried about whether I\u2019m doing enough or if something might slip through the cracks. That sense of responsibility feels heavy sometimes, though I try to manage it the best I can."

Still, at the end of the day, that pressure doesn\u2019t just disappear. It often leads to a restless mind when I\u2019m trying to sleep, with worries and thoughts running over again. Balancing my own needs with everyone else\u2019s feels like a constant challenge, and I\u2019m aware of it even as I push to maintain some stability.

Even when I get a decent number of hours, I often don\u2019t feel fully rested in the morning, which just adds to the sense of fatigue during the day.
