I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it.

It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break.

Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun.

It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow.
