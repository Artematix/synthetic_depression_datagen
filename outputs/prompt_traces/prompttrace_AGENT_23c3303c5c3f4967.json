Do not default to late 20s/early 30s. Create facets appropriate to the patient's life stage.\n- Make sure all information you create is compatible with the depression symptom profile. Higher symptom severity should show up as more impact on daily life, relationships, or goals. Lower severity should feel milder.\n- Keep trauma and serious adversity realistic and not universal. Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

Otherwise, things have been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say the low energy comes and goes, can you tell me more about when it tends to show up? How long does it usually last, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day activities? Have you noticed any particular triggers or patterns around it?\nPatient: It tends to come and go throughout the day, sometimes more noticeable in the afternoons. The tiredness can last a few hours, but it doesn\u2019t really stop me from getting things done. I wouldn\u2019t say it has a major effect on my daily routine. I haven't really picked up on any specific triggers or patterns.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. Let\u2019s talk about your sleep for a moment\u2014are you having any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling refreshed?\nPatient: No, my sleep has been fairly normal. I don\u2019t have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, and I usually feel okay when I wake up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear your sleep is steady, Claire. How about your mood\u2014have you been feeling down or sad recently?\nPatient: I have felt down at times, though not too often or too deeply. It\u2019s more like a low mood that passes rather than something that really overwhelms me.\nDoctor: When you feel this low mood, Claire, how long does it usually last? Are there certain situations that seem to bring it on more? What do you usually do to manage or cope when these feelings come up?\nPatient: The low moods tend to be brief and come and go without lasting for too long. I haven't noticed any particular situations that clearly trigger them. Usually, I just keep going with my routine and try to focus on what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Claire, how do these brief low moods affect how you feel overall during the day? When you push through them and keep up with your routine, does that feel manageable most of the time, or do you notice it wearing you down?\nPatient: For the most part, pushing through those low moods feels manageable. They don't seem to wear me down too much since they don\u2019t last very long. Sticking to my routine helps keep things steady.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Claire. During those low moods, do you notice any changes in your motivation or energy to do things? Does staying on your routine ever feel like a struggle, even just a little?\nPatient: Yes, my motivation and energy do dip somewhat during those times. It takes a bit more effort, but I\u2019m usually still able to keep up with my routine without too much difficulty.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to check in about how things you normally enjoy feel right now.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hello. Lately, I've been feeling a bit off, mostly tired more than usual. Nothing extreme, just a general sense of low energy that comes and goes. Otherwise, things have been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say the low energy comes and goes, can you tell me more about when it tends to show up? How long does it usually last, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day activities? Have you noticed any particular triggers or patterns around it?\nPatient: It tends to come and go throughout the day, sometimes more noticeable in the afternoons. The tiredness can last a few hours, but it doesn\u2019t really stop me from getting things done. I wouldn\u2019t say it has a major effect on my daily routine. I haven't really picked up on any specific triggers or patterns.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. Let\u2019s talk about your sleep for a moment\u2014are you having any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling refreshed?\nPatient: No, my sleep has been fairly normal. I don\u2019t have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, and I usually feel okay when I wake up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear your sleep is steady, Claire. How about your mood\u2014have you been feeling down or sad recently?\nPatient: I have felt down at times, though not too often or too deeply. It\u2019s more like a low mood that passes rather than something that really overwhelms me.\nDoctor: When you feel this low mood, Claire, how long does it usually last? Are there certain situations that seem to bring it on more? What do you usually do to manage or cope when these feelings come up?\nPatient: The low moods tend to be brief and come and go without lasting for too long. I haven't noticed any particular situations that clearly trigger them. Usually, I just keep going with my routine and try to focus on what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Claire, how do these brief low moods affect how you feel overall during the day? When you push through them and keep up with your routine, does that feel manageable most of the time, or do you notice it wearing you down?\nPatient: For the most part, pushing through those low moods feels manageable. They don't seem to wear me down too much since they don\u2019t last very long. Sticking to my routine helps keep things steady.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Claire. During those low moods, do you notice any changes in your motivation or energy to do things? Does staying on your routine ever feel like a struggle, even just a little?\nPatient: Yes, my motivation and energy do dip somewhat during those times. It takes a bit more effort, but I\u2019m usually still able to keep up with my routine without too much difficulty.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to check in about how things you normally enjoy feel right now. Have you noticed any changes\u2014like having less interest or pleasure in activities you usually like, especially during times when your mood or energy dips?\nPatient: There have been times when things I usually enjoy feel less interesting or satisfying, though it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more occasional and doesn\u2019t really stop me from doing those things.\nDoctor: Can you tell me about some specific activities that have felt less interesting or satisfying lately, Claire? How often does this happen, and do you find it affects your mood or motivation when it does?\nPatient: Sometimes, activities like reading or watching movies feel a bit less interesting than usual.

It happens occasionally rather than all the time. When it does, it might lower my mood or motivation just a little, but not significantly.\nDoctor: Claire, when reading or watching movies feel less interesting, what does that actually feel like for you? How often do those moments come up, how long do they last, and what do you usually do to manage or get through them?\nPatient: When reading or watching movies feel less interesting, it mostly just feels a bit dull or unengaging.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hello. Lately, I've been feeling a bit off, mostly tired more than usual. Nothing extreme, just a general sense of low energy that comes and goes. Otherwise, things have been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say the low energy comes and goes, can you tell me more about when it tends to show up? How long does it usually last, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day activities? Have you noticed any particular triggers or patterns around it?\nPatient: It tends to come and go throughout the day, sometimes more noticeable in the afternoons. The tiredness can last a few hours, but it doesn\u2019t really stop me from getting things done. I wouldn\u2019t say it has a major effect on my daily routine. I haven't really picked up on any specific triggers or patterns.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. Let\u2019s talk about your sleep for a moment\u2014are you having any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling refreshed?\nPatient: No, my sleep has been fairly normal. I don\u2019t have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, and I usually feel okay when I wake up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear your sleep is steady, Claire. How about your mood\u2014have you been feeling down or sad recently?\nPatient: I have felt down at times, though not too often or too deeply. It\u2019s more like a low mood that passes rather than something that really overwhelms me.\nDoctor: When you feel this low mood, Claire, how long does it usually last? Are there certain situations that seem to bring it on more? What do you usually do to manage or cope when these feelings come up?\nPatient: The low moods tend to be brief and come and go without lasting for too long. I haven't noticed any particular situations that clearly trigger them. Usually, I just keep going with my routine and try to focus on what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Claire, how do these brief low moods affect how you feel overall during the day? When you push through them and keep up with your routine, does that feel manageable most of the time, or do you notice it wearing you down?\nPatient: For the most part, pushing through those low moods feels manageable. They don't seem to wear me down too much since they don\u2019t last very long. Sticking to my routine helps keep things steady.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Claire. During those low moods, do you notice any changes in your motivation or energy to do things? Does staying on your routine ever feel like a struggle, even just a little?\nPatient: Yes, my motivation and energy do dip somewhat during those times. It takes a bit more effort, but I\u2019m usually still able to keep up with my routine without too much difficulty.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to check in about how things you normally enjoy feel right now. Have you noticed any changes\u2014like having less interest or pleasure in activities you usually like, especially during times when your mood or energy dips?\nPatient: There have been times when things I usually enjoy feel less interesting or satisfying, though it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more occasional and doesn\u2019t really stop me from doing those things.\nDoctor: Can you tell me about some specific activities that have felt less interesting or satisfying lately, Claire? How often does this happen, and do you find it affects your mood or motivation when it does?\nPatient: Sometimes, activities like reading or watching movies feel a bit less interesting than usual. It happens occasionally rather than all the time. When it does, it might lower my mood or motivation just a little, but not significantly.\nDoctor: Claire, when reading or watching movies feel less interesting, what does that actually feel like for you? How often do those moments come up, how long do they last, and what do you usually do to manage or get through them?\nPatient: When reading or watching movies feel less interesting, it mostly just feels a bit dull or unengaging. Those moments come up occasionally and usually don\u2019t last very long. I more or less push through or distract myself without making a big deal out of it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling any times recently where you felt worthless or overly guilty about things, even when you think those feelings might not match the situation?\nPatient: That doesn\u2019t happen very often. I might feel that way once in a while, but it\u2019s rare and doesn\u2019t really stick with me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s completely normal to have those feelings now and then, Claire, especially with everything you\u2019re navigating.

Nothing extreme, just a general sense of low energy that comes and goes. Otherwise, things have been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say the low energy comes and goes, can you tell me more about when it tends to show up? How long does it usually last, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day activities? Have you noticed any particular triggers or patterns around it?\nPatient: It tends to come and go throughout the day, sometimes more noticeable in the afternoons. The tiredness can last a few hours, but it doesn\u2019t really stop me from getting things done. I wouldn\u2019t say it has a major effect on my daily routine. I haven't really picked up on any specific triggers or patterns.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. Let\u2019s talk about your sleep for a moment\u2014are you having any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling refreshed?\nPatient: No, my sleep has been fairly normal. I don\u2019t have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, and I usually feel okay when I wake up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear your sleep is steady, Claire. How about your mood\u2014have you been feeling down or sad recently?\nPatient: I have felt down at times, though not too often or too deeply. It\u2019s more like a low mood that passes rather than something that really overwhelms me.\nDoctor: When you feel this low mood, Claire, how long does it usually last? Are there certain situations that seem to bring it on more? What do you usually do to manage or cope when these feelings come up?\nPatient: The low moods tend to be brief and come and go without lasting for too long. I haven't noticed any particular situations that clearly trigger them. Usually, I just keep going with my routine and try to focus on what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Claire, how do these brief low moods affect how you feel overall during the day? When you push through them and keep up with your routine, does that feel manageable most of the time, or do you notice it wearing you down?\nPatient: For the most part, pushing through those low moods feels manageable. They don't seem to wear me down too much since they don\u2019t last very long. Sticking to my routine helps keep things steady.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Claire. During those low moods, do you notice any changes in your motivation or energy to do things? Does staying on your routine ever feel like a struggle, even just a little?\nPatient: Yes, my motivation and energy do dip somewhat during those times. It takes a bit more effort, but I\u2019m usually still able to keep up with my routine without too much difficulty.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to check in about how things you normally enjoy feel right now. Have you noticed any changes\u2014like having less interest or pleasure in activities you usually like, especially during times when your mood or energy dips?\nPatient: There have been times when things I usually enjoy feel less interesting or satisfying, though it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more occasional and doesn\u2019t really stop me from doing those things.\nDoctor: Can you tell me about some specific activities that have felt less interesting or satisfying lately, Claire? How often does this happen, and do you find it affects your mood or motivation when it does?\nPatient: Sometimes, activities like reading or watching movies feel a bit less interesting than usual. It happens occasionally rather than all the time. When it does, it might lower my mood or motivation just a little, but not significantly.\nDoctor: Claire, when reading or watching movies feel less interesting, what does that actually feel like for you? How often do those moments come up, how long do they last, and what do you usually do to manage or get through them?\nPatient: When reading or watching movies feel less interesting, it mostly just feels a bit dull or unengaging. Those moments come up occasionally and usually don\u2019t last very long. I more or less push through or distract myself without making a big deal out of it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling any times recently where you felt worthless or overly guilty about things, even when you think those feelings might not match the situation?\nPatient: That doesn\u2019t happen very often. I might feel that way once in a while, but it\u2019s rare and doesn\u2019t really stick with me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s completely normal to have those feelings now and then, Claire, especially with everything you\u2019re navigating. I appreciate you being open about it. If it ever feels like more or starts to linger, I\u2019m here to talk it through whenever you\u2019re ready.\nPatient: Thank you. I appreciate that.

Nothing extreme, just a general sense of low energy that comes and goes. Otherwise, things have been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say the low energy comes and goes, can you tell me more about when it tends to show up? How long does it usually last, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day activities? Have you noticed any particular triggers or patterns around it?\nPatient: It tends to come and go throughout the day, sometimes more noticeable in the afternoons. The tiredness can last a few hours, but it doesn\u2019t really stop me from getting things done. I wouldn\u2019t say it has a major effect on my daily routine. I haven't really picked up on any specific triggers or patterns.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. Let\u2019s talk about your sleep for a moment\u2014are you having any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling refreshed?\nPatient: No, my sleep has been fairly normal. I don\u2019t have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, and I usually feel okay when I wake up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear your sleep is steady, Claire. How about your mood\u2014have you been feeling down or sad recently?\nPatient: I have felt down at times, though not too often or too deeply. It\u2019s more like a low mood that passes rather than something that really overwhelms me.\nDoctor: When you feel this low mood, Claire, how long does it usually last? Are there certain situations that seem to bring it on more? What do you usually do to manage or cope when these feelings come up?\nPatient: The low moods tend to be brief and come and go without lasting for too long. I haven't noticed any particular situations that clearly trigger them. Usually, I just keep going with my routine and try to focus on what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Claire, how do these brief low moods affect how you feel overall during the day? When you push through them and keep up with your routine, does that feel manageable most of the time, or do you notice it wearing you down?\nPatient: For the most part, pushing through those low moods feels manageable. They don't seem to wear me down too much since they don\u2019t last very long. Sticking to my routine helps keep things steady.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Claire. During those low moods, do you notice any changes in your motivation or energy to do things? Does staying on your routine ever feel like a struggle, even just a little?\nPatient: Yes, my motivation and energy do dip somewhat during those times. It takes a bit more effort, but I\u2019m usually still able to keep up with my routine without too much difficulty.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to check in about how things you normally enjoy feel right now. Have you noticed any changes\u2014like having less interest or pleasure in activities you usually like, especially during times when your mood or energy dips?\nPatient: There have been times when things I usually enjoy feel less interesting or satisfying, though it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more occasional and doesn\u2019t really stop me from doing those things.\nDoctor: Can you tell me about some specific activities that have felt less interesting or satisfying lately, Claire? How often does this happen, and do you find it affects your mood or motivation when it does?\nPatient: Sometimes, activities like reading or watching movies feel a bit less interesting than usual. It happens occasionally rather than all the time. When it does, it might lower my mood or motivation just a little, but not significantly.\nDoctor: Claire, when reading or watching movies feel less interesting, what does that actually feel like for you? How often do those moments come up, how long do they last, and what do you usually do to manage or get through them?\nPatient: When reading or watching movies feel less interesting, it mostly just feels a bit dull or unengaging. Those moments come up occasionally and usually don\u2019t last very long. I more or less push through or distract myself without making a big deal out of it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling any times recently where you felt worthless or overly guilty about things, even when you think those feelings might not match the situation?\nPatient: That doesn\u2019t happen very often. I might feel that way once in a while, but it\u2019s rare and doesn\u2019t really stick with me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s completely normal to have those feelings now and then, Claire, especially with everything you\u2019re navigating.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hello. Lately, I've been feeling a bit off, mostly tired more than usual. Nothing extreme, just a general sense of low energy that comes and goes. Otherwise, things have been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say the low energy comes and goes, can you tell me more about when it tends to show up? How long does it usually last, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day activities? Have you noticed any particular triggers or patterns around it?\nPatient: It tends to come and go throughout the day, sometimes more noticeable in the afternoons. The tiredness can last a few hours, but it doesn\u2019t really stop me from getting things done. I wouldn\u2019t say it has a major effect on my daily routine. I haven't really picked up on any specific triggers or patterns.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. Let\u2019s talk about your sleep for a moment\u2014are you having any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling refreshed?\nPatient: No, my sleep has been fairly normal. I don\u2019t have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, and I usually feel okay when I wake up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear your sleep is steady, Claire. How about your mood\u2014have you been feeling down or sad recently?\nPatient: I have felt down at times, though not too often or too deeply. It\u2019s more like a low mood that passes rather than something that really overwhelms me.\nDoctor: When you feel this low mood, Claire, how long does it usually last? Are there certain situations that seem to bring it on more? What do you usually do to manage or cope when these feelings come up?\nPatient: The low moods tend to be brief and come and go without lasting for too long. I haven't noticed any particular situations that clearly trigger them. Usually, I just keep going with my routine and try to focus on what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Claire, how do these brief low moods affect how you feel overall during the day? When you push through them and keep up with your routine, does that feel manageable most of the time, or do you notice it wearing you down?\nPatient: For the most part, pushing through those low moods feels manageable. They don't seem to wear me down too much since they don\u2019t last very long. Sticking to my routine helps keep things steady.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Claire. During those low moods, do you notice any changes in your motivation or energy to do things? Does staying on your routine ever feel like a struggle, even just a little?\nPatient: Yes, my motivation and energy do dip somewhat during those times. It takes a bit more effort, but I\u2019m usually still able to keep up with my routine without too much difficulty.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to check in about how things you normally enjoy feel right now. Have you noticed any changes\u2014like having less interest or pleasure in activities you usually like, especially during times when your mood or energy dips?\nPatient: There have been times when things I usually enjoy feel less interesting or satisfying, though it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more occasional and doesn\u2019t really stop me from doing those things.\nDoctor: Can you tell me about some specific activities that have felt less interesting or satisfying lately, Claire? How often does this happen, and do you find it affects your mood or motivation when it does?\nPatient: Sometimes, activities like reading or watching movies feel a bit less interesting than usual. It happens occasionally rather than all the time. When it does, it might lower my mood or motivation just a little, but not significantly.\nDoctor: Claire, when reading or watching movies feel less interesting, what does that actually feel like for you? How often do those moments come up, how long do they last, and what do you usually do to manage or get through them?\nPatient: When reading or watching movies feel less interesting, it mostly just feels a bit dull or unengaging. Those moments come up occasionally and usually don\u2019t last very long. I more or less push through or distract myself without making a big deal out of it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling any times recently where you felt worthless or overly guilty about things, even when you think those feelings might not match the situation?\nPatient: That doesn\u2019t happen very often. I might feel that way once in a while, but it\u2019s rare and doesn\u2019t really stick with me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s completely normal to have those feelings now and then, Claire, especially with everything you\u2019re navigating. I appreciate you being open about it. If it ever feels like more or starts to linger, I\u2019m here to talk it through whenever you\u2019re ready.\nPatient: Thank you. I appreciate that. Like I mentioned, those feelings are rare and don\u2019t really last long when they do come up. It\u2019s good to know you\u2019re available if it ever changes.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to ask something important\u2014have you had any thoughts about death, or about hurting yourself, even if just briefly or occasionally? It\u2019s okay to be honest here.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some thoughts like that, but they\u2019re very rare and don\u2019t last long.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Claire. It can be tough to talk about. Can you tell me how often these thoughts come up? Do you have any thoughts about how you would act on them, or a plan? What do you usually do when you have these thoughts?\nPatient: Those thoughts come up very rarely and don\u2019t really stick around. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent with them. Usually, I try to distract myself or push the thoughts away when they do happen.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say these thoughts come up rarely, how often would you say that is?

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hello. Lately, I've been feeling a bit off, mostly tired more than usual. Nothing extreme, just a general sense of low energy that comes and goes. Otherwise, things have been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say the low energy comes and goes, can you tell me more about when it tends to show up? How long does it usually last, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day activities? Have you noticed any particular triggers or patterns around it?\nPatient: It tends to come and go throughout the day, sometimes more noticeable in the afternoons. The tiredness can last a few hours, but it doesn\u2019t really stop me from getting things done. I wouldn\u2019t say it has a major effect on my daily routine. I haven't really picked up on any specific triggers or patterns.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. Let\u2019s talk about your sleep for a moment\u2014are you having any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling refreshed?\nPatient: No, my sleep has been fairly normal. I don\u2019t have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, and I usually feel okay when I wake up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear your sleep is steady, Claire. How about your mood\u2014have you been feeling down or sad recently?\nPatient: I have felt down at times, though not too often or too deeply. It\u2019s more like a low mood that passes rather than something that really overwhelms me.\nDoctor: When you feel this low mood, Claire, how long does it usually last? Are there certain situations that seem to bring it on more? What do you usually do to manage or cope when these feelings come up?\nPatient: The low moods tend to be brief and come and go without lasting for too long. I haven't noticed any particular situations that clearly trigger them. Usually, I just keep going with my routine and try to focus on what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Claire, how do these brief low moods affect how you feel overall during the day? When you push through them and keep up with your routine, does that feel manageable most of the time, or do you notice it wearing you down?\nPatient: For the most part, pushing through those low moods feels manageable. They don't seem to wear me down too much since they don\u2019t last very long. Sticking to my routine helps keep things steady.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Claire. During those low moods, do you notice any changes in your motivation or energy to do things? Does staying on your routine ever feel like a struggle, even just a little?\nPatient: Yes, my motivation and energy do dip somewhat during those times. It takes a bit more effort, but I\u2019m usually still able to keep up with my routine without too much difficulty.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to check in about how things you normally enjoy feel right now. Have you noticed any changes\u2014like having less interest or pleasure in activities you usually like, especially during times when your mood or energy dips?\nPatient: There have been times when things I usually enjoy feel less interesting or satisfying, though it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more occasional and doesn\u2019t really stop me from doing those things.\nDoctor: Can you tell me about some specific activities that have felt less interesting or satisfying lately, Claire? How often does this happen, and do you find it affects your mood or motivation when it does?\nPatient: Sometimes, activities like reading or watching movies feel a bit less interesting than usual. It happens occasionally rather than all the time. When it does, it might lower my mood or motivation just a little, but not significantly.\nDoctor: Claire, when reading or watching movies feel less interesting, what does that actually feel like for you? How often do those moments come up, how long do they last, and what do you usually do to manage or get through them?\nPatient: When reading or watching movies feel less interesting, it mostly just feels a bit dull or unengaging. Those moments come up occasionally and usually don\u2019t last very long. I more or less push through or distract myself without making a big deal out of it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling any times recently where you felt worthless or overly guilty about things, even when you think those feelings might not match the situation?\nPatient: That doesn\u2019t happen very often. I might feel that way once in a while, but it\u2019s rare and doesn\u2019t really stick with me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s completely normal to have those feelings now and then, Claire, especially with everything you\u2019re navigating. I appreciate you being open about it. If it ever feels like more or starts to linger, I\u2019m here to talk it through whenever you\u2019re ready.\nPatient: Thank you. I appreciate that. Like I mentioned, those feelings are rare and don\u2019t really last long when they do come up. It\u2019s good to know you\u2019re available if it ever changes.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to ask something important\u2014have you had any thoughts about death, or about hurting yourself, even if just briefly or occasionally? It\u2019s okay to be honest here.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some thoughts like that, but they\u2019re very rare and don\u2019t last long.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Claire. It can be tough to talk about. Can you tell me how often these thoughts come up? Do you have any thoughts about how you would act on them, or a plan? What do you usually do when you have these thoughts?\nPatient: Those thoughts come up very rarely and don\u2019t really stick around. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent with them. Usually, I try to distract myself or push the thoughts away when they do happen.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say these thoughts come up rarely, how often would you say that is? And how well do you feel your ways of coping\u2014like distracting yourself\u2014are working when those thoughts pop up? It\u2019s good you have ways to manage; I want to make sure you feel safe sharing here.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s not more than once every few weeks, maybe even less often. Distraction usually helps enough to keep things from becoming too difficult. I do feel safe sharing this with you.\nDoctor: Claire, since you mentioned feeling tired and low in energy earlier, I want to understand that a bit better.

I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling any times recently where you felt worthless or overly guilty about things, even when you think those feelings might not match the situation?\nPatient: That doesn\u2019t happen very often. I might feel that way once in a while, but it\u2019s rare and doesn\u2019t really stick with me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s completely normal to have those feelings now and then, Claire, especially with everything you\u2019re navigating. I appreciate you being open about it. If it ever feels like more or starts to linger, I\u2019m here to talk it through whenever you\u2019re ready.\nPatient: Thank you. I appreciate that. Like I mentioned, those feelings are rare and don\u2019t really last long when they do come up. It\u2019s good to know you\u2019re available if it ever changes.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to ask something important\u2014have you had any thoughts about death, or about hurting yourself, even if just briefly or occasionally? It\u2019s okay to be honest here.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some thoughts like that, but they\u2019re very rare and don\u2019t last long.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Claire. It can be tough to talk about. Can you tell me how often these thoughts come up? Do you have any thoughts about how you would act on them, or a plan? What do you usually do when you have these thoughts?\nPatient: Those thoughts come up very rarely and don\u2019t really stick around. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent with them. Usually, I try to distract myself or push the thoughts away when they do happen.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say these thoughts come up rarely, how often would you say that is? And how well do you feel your ways of coping\u2014like distracting yourself\u2014are working when those thoughts pop up? It\u2019s good you have ways to manage; I want to make sure you feel safe sharing here.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s not more than once every few weeks, maybe even less often. Distraction usually helps enough to keep things from becoming too difficult. I do feel safe sharing this with you.\nDoctor: Claire, since you mentioned feeling tired and low in energy earlier, I want to understand that a bit better. How often do you notice these feelings during your day, and how much do they affect what you\u2019re able to do? It sounds like you\u2019ve been managing quite a bit.\nPatient: I notice feeling tired or low in energy fairly often, maybe a few times throughout the day.

I mostly manage by pushing myself to keep going despite the fatigue.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nI notice feeling tired or low in energy fairly often, maybe a few times throughout the day.

Nothing extreme, just a general sense of low energy that comes and goes. Otherwise, things have been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say the low energy comes and goes, can you tell me more about when it tends to show up? How long does it usually last, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day activities? Have you noticed any particular triggers or patterns around it?\nPatient: It tends to come and go throughout the day, sometimes more noticeable in the afternoons. The tiredness can last a few hours, but it doesn\u2019t really stop me from getting things done. I wouldn\u2019t say it has a major effect on my daily routine. I haven't really picked up on any specific triggers or patterns.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. Let\u2019s talk about your sleep for a moment\u2014are you having any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling refreshed?\nPatient: No, my sleep has been fairly normal. I don\u2019t have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, and I usually feel okay when I wake up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear your sleep is steady, Claire. How about your mood\u2014have you been feeling down or sad recently?\nPatient: I have felt down at times, though not too often or too deeply. It\u2019s more like a low mood that passes rather than something that really overwhelms me.\nDoctor: When you feel this low mood, Claire, how long does it usually last? Are there certain situations that seem to bring it on more? What do you usually do to manage or cope when these feelings come up?\nPatient: The low moods tend to be brief and come and go without lasting for too long. I haven't noticed any particular situations that clearly trigger them. Usually, I just keep going with my routine and try to focus on what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Claire, how do these brief low moods affect how you feel overall during the day? When you push through them and keep up with your routine, does that feel manageable most of the time, or do you notice it wearing you down?\nPatient: For the most part, pushing through those low moods feels manageable. They don't seem to wear me down too much since they don\u2019t last very long. Sticking to my routine helps keep things steady.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Claire. During those low moods, do you notice any changes in your motivation or energy to do things? Does staying on your routine ever feel like a struggle, even just a little?\nPatient: Yes, my motivation and energy do dip somewhat during those times. It takes a bit more effort, but I\u2019m usually still able to keep up with my routine without too much difficulty.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to check in about how things you normally enjoy feel right now. Have you noticed any changes\u2014like having less interest or pleasure in activities you usually like, especially during times when your mood or energy dips?\nPatient: There have been times when things I usually enjoy feel less interesting or satisfying, though it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more occasional and doesn\u2019t really stop me from doing those things.\nDoctor: Can you tell me about some specific activities that have felt less interesting or satisfying lately, Claire? How often does this happen, and do you find it affects your mood or motivation when it does?\nPatient: Sometimes, activities like reading or watching movies feel a bit less interesting than usual. It happens occasionally rather than all the time. When it does, it might lower my mood or motivation just a little, but not significantly.\nDoctor: Claire, when reading or watching movies feel less interesting, what does that actually feel like for you? How often do those moments come up, how long do they last, and what do you usually do to manage or get through them?\nPatient: When reading or watching movies feel less interesting, it mostly just feels a bit dull or unengaging. Those moments come up occasionally and usually don\u2019t last very long. I more or less push through or distract myself without making a big deal out of it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire.

What do you usually do to manage or cope when these feelings come up?\nPatient: The low moods tend to be brief and come and go without lasting for too long. I haven't noticed any particular situations that clearly trigger them. Usually, I just keep going with my routine and try to focus on what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Claire, how do these brief low moods affect how you feel overall during the day? When you push through them and keep up with your routine, does that feel manageable most of the time, or do you notice it wearing you down?\nPatient: For the most part, pushing through those low moods feels manageable. They don't seem to wear me down too much since they don\u2019t last very long. Sticking to my routine helps keep things steady.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Claire. During those low moods, do you notice any changes in your motivation or energy to do things? Does staying on your routine ever feel like a struggle, even just a little?\nPatient: Yes, my motivation and energy do dip somewhat during those times. It takes a bit more effort, but I\u2019m usually still able to keep up with my routine without too much difficulty.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to check in about how things you normally enjoy feel right now. Have you noticed any changes\u2014like having less interest or pleasure in activities you usually like, especially during times when your mood or energy dips?\nPatient: There have been times when things I usually enjoy feel less interesting or satisfying, though it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more occasional and doesn\u2019t really stop me from doing those things.\nDoctor: Can you tell me about some specific activities that have felt less interesting or satisfying lately, Claire? How often does this happen, and do you find it affects your mood or motivation when it does?\nPatient: Sometimes, activities like reading or watching movies feel a bit less interesting than usual. It happens occasionally rather than all the time. When it does, it might lower my mood or motivation just a little, but not significantly.\nDoctor: Claire, when reading or watching movies feel less interesting, what does that actually feel like for you? How often do those moments come up, how long do they last, and what do you usually do to manage or get through them?\nPatient: When reading or watching movies feel less interesting, it mostly just feels a bit dull or unengaging. Those moments come up occasionally and usually don\u2019t last very long. I more or less push through or distract myself without making a big deal out of it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling any times recently where you felt worthless or overly guilty about things, even when you think those feelings might not match the situation?\nPatient: That doesn\u2019t happen very often. I might feel that way once in a while, but it\u2019s rare and doesn\u2019t really stick with me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s completely normal to have those feelings now and then, Claire, especially with everything you\u2019re navigating. I appreciate you being open about it. If it ever feels like more or starts to linger, I\u2019m here to talk it through whenever you\u2019re ready.\nPatient: Thank you. I appreciate that. Like I mentioned, those feelings are rare and don\u2019t really last long when they do come up. It\u2019s good to know you\u2019re available if it ever changes.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to ask something important\u2014have you had any thoughts about death, or about hurting yourself, even if just briefly or occasionally? It\u2019s okay to be honest here.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some thoughts like that, but they\u2019re very rare and don\u2019t last long.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Claire. It can be tough to talk about. Can you tell me how often these thoughts come up? Do you have any thoughts about how you would act on them, or a plan? What do you usually do when you have these thoughts?\nPatient: Those thoughts come up very rarely and don\u2019t really stick around. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent with them. Usually, I try to distract myself or push the thoughts away when they do happen.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say these thoughts come up rarely, how often would you say that is? And how well do you feel your ways of coping\u2014like distracting yourself\u2014are working when those thoughts pop up? It\u2019s good you have ways to manage; I want to make sure you feel safe sharing here.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s not more than once every few weeks, maybe even less often. Distraction usually helps enough to keep things from becoming too difficult. I do feel safe sharing this with you.\nDoctor: Claire, since you mentioned feeling tired and low in energy earlier, I want to understand that a bit better. How often do you notice these feelings during your day, and how much do they affect what you\u2019re able to do? It sounds like you\u2019ve been managing quite a bit.\nPatient: I notice feeling tired or low in energy fairly often, maybe a few times throughout the day. It\u2019s noticeable, but it doesn\u2019t usually stop me from doing what needs to be done. I mostly manage by pushing myself to keep going despite the fatigue.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re working hard to keep things on track, Claire. When you feel that tiredness, does it ever make it harder to concentrate or make decisions during the day?\nPatient: Sometimes when I\u2019m tired, concentration feels a bit off, but my ability to make decisions doesn\u2019t seem noticeably affected.

Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hello. Lately, I've been feeling a bit off, mostly tired more than usual. Nothing extreme, just a general sense of low energy that comes and goes. Otherwise, things have been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say the low energy comes and goes, can you tell me more about when it tends to show up? How long does it usually last, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day activities? Have you noticed any particular triggers or patterns around it?\nPatient: It tends to come and go throughout the day, sometimes more noticeable in the afternoons. The tiredness can last a few hours, but it doesn\u2019t really stop me from getting things done. I wouldn\u2019t say it has a major effect on my daily routine. I haven't really picked up on any specific triggers or patterns.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. Let\u2019s talk about your sleep for a moment\u2014are you having any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling refreshed?\nPatient: No, my sleep has been fairly normal. I don\u2019t have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, and I usually feel okay when I wake up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear your sleep is steady, Claire. How about your mood\u2014have you been feeling down or sad recently?\nPatient: I have felt down at times, though not too often or too deeply. It\u2019s more like a low mood that passes rather than something that really overwhelms me.\nDoctor: When you feel this low mood, Claire, how long does it usually last? Are there certain situations that seem to bring it on more? What do you usually do to manage or cope when these feelings come up?\nPatient: The low moods tend to be brief and come and go without lasting for too long. I haven't noticed any particular situations that clearly trigger them. Usually, I just keep going with my routine and try to focus on what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Claire, how do these brief low moods affect how you feel overall during the day? When you push through them and keep up with your routine, does that feel manageable most of the time, or do you notice it wearing you down?\nPatient: For the most part, pushing through those low moods feels manageable. They don't seem to wear me down too much since they don\u2019t last very long. Sticking to my routine helps keep things steady.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Claire. During those low moods, do you notice any changes in your motivation or energy to do things? Does staying on your routine ever feel like a struggle, even just a little?\nPatient: Yes, my motivation and energy do dip somewhat during those times. It takes a bit more effort, but I\u2019m usually still able to keep up with my routine without too much difficulty.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to check in about how things you normally enjoy feel right now. Have you noticed any changes\u2014like having less interest or pleasure in activities you usually like, especially during times when your mood or energy dips?\nPatient: There have been times when things I usually enjoy feel less interesting or satisfying, though it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more occasional and doesn\u2019t really stop me from doing those things.\nDoctor: Can you tell me about some specific activities that have felt less interesting or satisfying lately, Claire? How often does this happen, and do you find it affects your mood or motivation when it does?\nPatient: Sometimes, activities like reading or watching movies feel a bit less interesting than usual. It happens occasionally rather than all the time. When it does, it might lower my mood or motivation just a little, but not significantly.\nDoctor: Claire, when reading or watching movies feel less interesting, what does that actually feel like for you? How often do those moments come up, how long do they last, and what do you usually do to manage or get through them?\nPatient: When reading or watching movies feel less interesting, it mostly just feels a bit dull or unengaging. Those moments come up occasionally and usually don\u2019t last very long. I more or less push through or distract myself without making a big deal out of it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling any times recently where you felt worthless or overly guilty about things, even when you think those feelings might not match the situation?\nPatient: That doesn\u2019t happen very often. I might feel that way once in a while, but it\u2019s rare and doesn\u2019t really stick with me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s completely normal to have those feelings now and then, Claire, especially with everything you\u2019re navigating. I appreciate you being open about it. If it ever feels like more or starts to linger, I\u2019m here to talk it through whenever you\u2019re ready.\nPatient: Thank you. I appreciate that. Like I mentioned, those feelings are rare and don\u2019t really last long when they do come up. It\u2019s good to know you\u2019re available if it ever changes.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to ask something important\u2014have you had any thoughts about death, or about hurting yourself, even if just briefly or occasionally? It\u2019s okay to be honest here.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some thoughts like that, but they\u2019re very rare and don\u2019t last long.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Claire. It can be tough to talk about. Can you tell me how often these thoughts come up? Do you have any thoughts about how you would act on them, or a plan? What do you usually do when you have these thoughts?\nPatient: Those thoughts come up very rarely and don\u2019t really stick around. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent with them. Usually, I try to distract myself or push the thoughts away when they do happen.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say these thoughts come up rarely, how often would you say that is? And how well do you feel your ways of coping\u2014like distracting yourself\u2014are working when those thoughts pop up? It\u2019s good you have ways to manage; I want to make sure you feel safe sharing here.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s not more than once every few weeks, maybe even less often. Distraction usually helps enough to keep things from becoming too difficult. I do feel safe sharing this with you.\nDoctor: Claire, since you mentioned feeling tired and low in energy earlier, I want to understand that a bit better. How often do you notice these feelings during your day, and how much do they affect what you\u2019re able to do? It sounds like you\u2019ve been managing quite a bit.\nPatient: I notice feeling tired or low in energy fairly often, maybe a few times throughout the day. It\u2019s noticeable, but it doesn\u2019t usually stop me from doing what needs to be done. I mostly manage by pushing myself to keep going despite the fatigue.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re working hard to keep things on track, Claire. When you feel that tiredness, does it ever make it harder to concentrate or make decisions during the day?\nPatient: Sometimes when I\u2019m tired, concentration feels a bit off, but my ability to make decisions doesn\u2019t seem noticeably affected. The fatigue affects my overall energy more than my thinking.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying that, Claire. Apart from the times you feel tired, have you noticed any ongoing trouble concentrating or making decisions? If so, can you share some examples or situations where that happens? I want to get a clear picture of how this impacts your daily life.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any ongoing trouble concentrating or making decisions. When concentration feels off, it\u2019s just occasional and usually tied to feeling tired. It doesn\u2019t really affect how I handle things day to day.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nNo, I haven\u2019t noticed any ongoing trouble concentrating or making decisions.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hello. Lately, I've been feeling a bit off, mostly tired more than usual. Nothing extreme, just a general sense of low energy that comes and goes. Otherwise, things have been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say the low energy comes and goes, can you tell me more about when it tends to show up? How long does it usually last, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day activities? Have you noticed any particular triggers or patterns around it?\nPatient: It tends to come and go throughout the day, sometimes more noticeable in the afternoons. The tiredness can last a few hours, but it doesn\u2019t really stop me from getting things done. I wouldn\u2019t say it has a major effect on my daily routine. I haven't really picked up on any specific triggers or patterns.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. Let\u2019s talk about your sleep for a moment\u2014are you having any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling refreshed?\nPatient: No, my sleep has been fairly normal. I don\u2019t have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, and I usually feel okay when I wake up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear your sleep is steady, Claire. How about your mood\u2014have you been feeling down or sad recently?\nPatient: I have felt down at times, though not too often or too deeply. It\u2019s more like a low mood that passes rather than something that really overwhelms me.\nDoctor: When you feel this low mood, Claire, how long does it usually last? Are there certain situations that seem to bring it on more? What do you usually do to manage or cope when these feelings come up?\nPatient: The low moods tend to be brief and come and go without lasting for too long. I haven't noticed any particular situations that clearly trigger them. Usually, I just keep going with my routine and try to focus on what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Claire, how do these brief low moods affect how you feel overall during the day? When you push through them and keep up with your routine, does that feel manageable most of the time, or do you notice it wearing you down?\nPatient: For the most part, pushing through those low moods feels manageable. They don't seem to wear me down too much since they don\u2019t last very long. Sticking to my routine helps keep things steady.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Claire. During those low moods, do you notice any changes in your motivation or energy to do things? Does staying on your routine ever feel like a struggle, even just a little?\nPatient: Yes, my motivation and energy do dip somewhat during those times. It takes a bit more effort, but I\u2019m usually still able to keep up with my routine without too much difficulty.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to check in about how things you normally enjoy feel right now. Have you noticed any changes\u2014like having less interest or pleasure in activities you usually like, especially during times when your mood or energy dips?\nPatient: There have been times when things I usually enjoy feel less interesting or satisfying, though it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more occasional and doesn\u2019t really stop me from doing those things.\nDoctor: Can you tell me about some specific activities that have felt less interesting or satisfying lately, Claire? How often does this happen, and do you find it affects your mood or motivation when it does?\nPatient: Sometimes, activities like reading or watching movies feel a bit less interesting than usual. It happens occasionally rather than all the time. When it does, it might lower my mood or motivation just a little, but not significantly.\nDoctor: Claire, when reading or watching movies feel less interesting, what does that actually feel like for you? How often do those moments come up, how long do they last, and what do you usually do to manage or get through them?\nPatient: When reading or watching movies feel less interesting, it mostly just feels a bit dull or unengaging. Those moments come up occasionally and usually don\u2019t last very long. I more or less push through or distract myself without making a big deal out of it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling any times recently where you felt worthless or overly guilty about things, even when you think those feelings might not match the situation?\nPatient: That doesn\u2019t happen very often. I might feel that way once in a while, but it\u2019s rare and doesn\u2019t really stick with me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s completely normal to have those feelings now and then, Claire, especially with everything you\u2019re navigating. I appreciate you being open about it. If it ever feels like more or starts to linger, I\u2019m here to talk it through whenever you\u2019re ready.\nPatient: Thank you. I appreciate that. Like I mentioned, those feelings are rare and don\u2019t really last long when they do come up. It\u2019s good to know you\u2019re available if it ever changes.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to ask something important\u2014have you had any thoughts about death, or about hurting yourself, even if just briefly or occasionally? It\u2019s okay to be honest here.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some thoughts like that, but they\u2019re very rare and don\u2019t last long.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Claire. It can be tough to talk about. Can you tell me how often these thoughts come up? Do you have any thoughts about how you would act on them, or a plan? What do you usually do when you have these thoughts?\nPatient: Those thoughts come up very rarely and don\u2019t really stick around. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent with them. Usually, I try to distract myself or push the thoughts away when they do happen.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say these thoughts come up rarely, how often would you say that is? And how well do you feel your ways of coping\u2014like distracting yourself\u2014are working when those thoughts pop up? It\u2019s good you have ways to manage; I want to make sure you feel safe sharing here.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s not more than once every few weeks, maybe even less often. Distraction usually helps enough to keep things from becoming too difficult. I do feel safe sharing this with you.\nDoctor: Claire, since you mentioned feeling tired and low in energy earlier, I want to understand that a bit better. How often do you notice these feelings during your day, and how much do they affect what you\u2019re able to do? It sounds like you\u2019ve been managing quite a bit.\nPatient: I notice feeling tired or low in energy fairly often, maybe a few times throughout the day. It\u2019s noticeable, but it doesn\u2019t usually stop me from doing what needs to be done. I mostly manage by pushing myself to keep going despite the fatigue.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re working hard to keep things on track, Claire. When you feel that tiredness, does it ever make it harder to concentrate or make decisions during the day?\nPatient: Sometimes when I\u2019m tired, concentration feels a bit off, but my ability to make decisions doesn\u2019t seem noticeably affected. The fatigue affects my overall energy more than my thinking.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying that, Claire. Apart from the times you feel tired, have you noticed any ongoing trouble concentrating or making decisions? If so, can you share some examples or situations where that happens? I want to get a clear picture of how this impacts your daily life.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any ongoing trouble concentrating or making decisions. When concentration feels off, it\u2019s just occasional and usually tied to feeling tired. It doesn\u2019t really affect how I handle things day to day.\nDoctor: That helps clear things up, Claire. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: Yes, there have been some changes in my appetite and a bit of weight fluctuation, but nothing too dramatic or concerning.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nYes, there have been some changes in my appetite and a bit of weight fluctuation, but nothing too dramatic or concerning.",

It\u2019s okay to be honest here.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some thoughts like that, but they\u2019re very rare and don\u2019t last long.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Claire. It can be tough to talk about. Can you tell me how often these thoughts come up? Do you have any thoughts about how you would act on them, or a plan? What do you usually do when you have these thoughts?\nPatient: Those thoughts come up very rarely and don\u2019t really stick around. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent with them. Usually, I try to distract myself or push the thoughts away when they do happen.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say these thoughts come up rarely, how often would you say that is? And how well do you feel your ways of coping\u2014like distracting yourself\u2014are working when those thoughts pop up? It\u2019s good you have ways to manage; I want to make sure you feel safe sharing here.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s not more than once every few weeks, maybe even less often. Distraction usually helps enough to keep things from becoming too difficult. I do feel safe sharing this with you.\nDoctor: Claire, since you mentioned feeling tired and low in energy earlier, I want to understand that a bit better. How often do you notice these feelings during your day, and how much do they affect what you\u2019re able to do? It sounds like you\u2019ve been managing quite a bit.\nPatient: I notice feeling tired or low in energy fairly often, maybe a few times throughout the day. It\u2019s noticeable, but it doesn\u2019t usually stop me from doing what needs to be done. I mostly manage by pushing myself to keep going despite the fatigue.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re working hard to keep things on track, Claire. When you feel that tiredness, does it ever make it harder to concentrate or make decisions during the day?\nPatient: Sometimes when I\u2019m tired, concentration feels a bit off, but my ability to make decisions doesn\u2019t seem noticeably affected. The fatigue affects my overall energy more than my thinking.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying that, Claire. Apart from the times you feel tired, have you noticed any ongoing trouble concentrating or making decisions? If so, can you share some examples or situations where that happens? I want to get a clear picture of how this impacts your daily life.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any ongoing trouble concentrating or making decisions. When concentration feels off, it\u2019s just occasional and usually tied to feeling tired. It doesn\u2019t really affect how I handle things day to day.\nDoctor: That helps clear things up, Claire. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: Yes, there have been some changes in my appetite and a bit of weight fluctuation, but nothing too dramatic or concerning.\nDoctor: Can you tell me more about these changes, Claire? Are you eating more or less than usual, and over what time frame have you noticed these shifts in appetite and weight? Understanding this helps me see how things are affecting you overall.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nCan you tell me more about these changes, Claire?

Understanding this helps me see how things are affecting you overall.\n\nTask:\nDecide how the patient should respond next and output JSON only.",

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hello. Lately, I've been feeling a bit off, mostly tired more than usual. Nothing extreme, just a general sense of low energy that comes and goes. Otherwise, things have been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say the low energy comes and goes, can you tell me more about when it tends to show up? How long does it usually last, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day activities? Have you noticed any particular triggers or patterns around it?\nPatient: It tends to come and go throughout the day, sometimes more noticeable in the afternoons. The tiredness can last a few hours, but it doesn\u2019t really stop me from getting things done. I wouldn\u2019t say it has a major effect on my daily routine. I haven't really picked up on any specific triggers or patterns.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. Let\u2019s talk about your sleep for a moment\u2014are you having any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling refreshed?\nPatient: No, my sleep has been fairly normal. I don\u2019t have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, and I usually feel okay when I wake up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear your sleep is steady, Claire. How about your mood\u2014have you been feeling down or sad recently?\nPatient: I have felt down at times, though not too often or too deeply. It\u2019s more like a low mood that passes rather than something that really overwhelms me.\nDoctor: When you feel this low mood, Claire, how long does it usually last? Are there certain situations that seem to bring it on more? What do you usually do to manage or cope when these feelings come up?\nPatient: The low moods tend to be brief and come and go without lasting for too long. I haven't noticed any particular situations that clearly trigger them. Usually, I just keep going with my routine and try to focus on what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Claire, how do these brief low moods affect how you feel overall during the day? When you push through them and keep up with your routine, does that feel manageable most of the time, or do you notice it wearing you down?\nPatient: For the most part, pushing through those low moods feels manageable. They don't seem to wear me down too much since they don\u2019t last very long. Sticking to my routine helps keep things steady.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Claire. During those low moods, do you notice any changes in your motivation or energy to do things? Does staying on your routine ever feel like a struggle, even just a little?\nPatient: Yes, my motivation and energy do dip somewhat during those times. It takes a bit more effort, but I\u2019m usually still able to keep up with my routine without too much difficulty.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to check in about how things you normally enjoy feel right now. Have you noticed any changes\u2014like having less interest or pleasure in activities you usually like, especially during times when your mood or energy dips?\nPatient: There have been times when things I usually enjoy feel less interesting or satisfying, though it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more occasional and doesn\u2019t really stop me from doing those things.\nDoctor: Can you tell me about some specific activities that have felt less interesting or satisfying lately, Claire? How often does this happen, and do you find it affects your mood or motivation when it does?\nPatient: Sometimes, activities like reading or watching movies feel a bit less interesting than usual. It happens occasionally rather than all the time. When it does, it might lower my mood or motivation just a little, but not significantly.\nDoctor: Claire, when reading or watching movies feel less interesting, what does that actually feel like for you? How often do those moments come up, how long do they last, and what do you usually do to manage or get through them?\nPatient: When reading or watching movies feel less interesting, it mostly just feels a bit dull or unengaging. Those moments come up occasionally and usually don\u2019t last very long. I more or less push through or distract myself without making a big deal out of it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling any times recently where you felt worthless or overly guilty about things, even when you think those feelings might not match the situation?\nPatient: That doesn\u2019t happen very often. I might feel that way once in a while, but it\u2019s rare and doesn\u2019t really stick with me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s completely normal to have those feelings now and then, Claire, especially with everything you\u2019re navigating. I appreciate you being open about it. If it ever feels like more or starts to linger, I\u2019m here to talk it through whenever you\u2019re ready.\nPatient: Thank you. I appreciate that.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hello. Lately, I've been feeling a bit off, mostly tired more than usual. Nothing extreme, just a general sense of low energy that comes and goes. Otherwise, things have been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say the low energy comes and goes, can you tell me more about when it tends to show up? How long does it usually last, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day activities? Have you noticed any particular triggers or patterns around it?\nPatient: It tends to come and go throughout the day, sometimes more noticeable in the afternoons. The tiredness can last a few hours, but it doesn\u2019t really stop me from getting things done. I wouldn\u2019t say it has a major effect on my daily routine. I haven't really picked up on any specific triggers or patterns.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. Let\u2019s talk about your sleep for a moment\u2014are you having any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling refreshed?\nPatient: No, my sleep has been fairly normal. I don\u2019t have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, and I usually feel okay when I wake up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear your sleep is steady, Claire. How about your mood\u2014have you been feeling down or sad recently?\nPatient: I have felt down at times, though not too often or too deeply. It\u2019s more like a low mood that passes rather than something that really overwhelms me.\nDoctor: When you feel this low mood, Claire, how long does it usually last? Are there certain situations that seem to bring it on more? What do you usually do to manage or cope when these feelings come up?\nPatient: The low moods tend to be brief and come and go without lasting for too long. I haven't noticed any particular situations that clearly trigger them. Usually, I just keep going with my routine and try to focus on what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Claire, how do these brief low moods affect how you feel overall during the day? When you push through them and keep up with your routine, does that feel manageable most of the time, or do you notice it wearing you down?\nPatient: For the most part, pushing through those low moods feels manageable. They don't seem to wear me down too much since they don\u2019t last very long. Sticking to my routine helps keep things steady.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Claire. During those low moods, do you notice any changes in your motivation or energy to do things? Does staying on your routine ever feel like a struggle, even just a little?\nPatient: Yes, my motivation and energy do dip somewhat during those times. It takes a bit more effort, but I\u2019m usually still able to keep up with my routine without too much difficulty.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to check in about how things you normally enjoy feel right now. Have you noticed any changes\u2014like having less interest or pleasure in activities you usually like, especially during times when your mood or energy dips?\nPatient: There have been times when things I usually enjoy feel less interesting or satisfying, though it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more occasional and doesn\u2019t really stop me from doing those things.\nDoctor: Can you tell me about some specific activities that have felt less interesting or satisfying lately, Claire? How often does this happen, and do you find it affects your mood or motivation when it does?\nPatient: Sometimes, activities like reading or watching movies feel a bit less interesting than usual. It happens occasionally rather than all the time. When it does, it might lower my mood or motivation just a little, but not significantly.\nDoctor: Claire, when reading or watching movies feel less interesting, what does that actually feel like for you? How often do those moments come up, how long do they last, and what do you usually do to manage or get through them?\nPatient: When reading or watching movies feel less interesting, it mostly just feels a bit dull or unengaging. Those moments come up occasionally and usually don\u2019t last very long. I more or less push through or distract myself without making a big deal out of it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling any times recently where you felt worthless or overly guilty about things, even when you think those feelings might not match the situation?\nPatient: That doesn\u2019t happen very often. I might feel that way once in a while, but it\u2019s rare and doesn\u2019t really stick with me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s completely normal to have those feelings now and then, Claire, especially with everything you\u2019re navigating. I appreciate you being open about it. If it ever feels like more or starts to linger, I\u2019m here to talk it through whenever you\u2019re ready.\nPatient: Thank you. I appreciate that. Like I mentioned, those feelings are rare and don\u2019t really last long when they do come up. It\u2019s good to know you\u2019re available if it ever changes.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to ask something important\u2014have you had any thoughts about death, or about hurting yourself, even if just briefly or occasionally? It\u2019s okay to be honest here.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some thoughts like that, but they\u2019re very rare and don\u2019t last long.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Claire. It can be tough to talk about. Can you tell me how often these thoughts come up? Do you have any thoughts about how you would act on them, or a plan? What do you usually do when you have these thoughts?\nPatient: Those thoughts come up very rarely and don\u2019t really stick around. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent with them. Usually, I try to distract myself or push the thoughts away when they do happen.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say these thoughts come up rarely, how often would you say that is? And how well do you feel your ways of coping\u2014like distracting yourself\u2014are working when those thoughts pop up? It\u2019s good you have ways to manage; I want to make sure you feel safe sharing here.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s not more than once every few weeks, maybe even less often. Distraction usually helps enough to keep things from becoming too difficult. I do feel safe sharing this with you.\nDoctor: Claire, since you mentioned feeling tired and low in energy earlier, I want to understand that a bit better. How often do you notice these feelings during your day, and how much do they affect what you\u2019re able to do? It sounds like you\u2019ve been managing quite a bit.\nPatient: I notice feeling tired or low in energy fairly often, maybe a few times throughout the day. It\u2019s noticeable, but it doesn\u2019t usually stop me from doing what needs to be done. I mostly manage by pushing myself to keep going despite the fatigue.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re working hard to keep things on track, Claire. When you feel that tiredness, does it ever make it harder to concentrate or make decisions during the day?\nPatient: Sometimes when I\u2019m tired, concentration feels a bit off, but my ability to make decisions doesn\u2019t seem noticeably affected. The fatigue affects my overall energy more than my thinking.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying that, Claire. Apart from the times you feel tired, have you noticed any ongoing trouble concentrating or making decisions? If so, can you share some examples or situations where that happens? I want to get a clear picture of how this impacts your daily life.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any ongoing trouble concentrating or making decisions. When concentration feels off, it\u2019s just occasional and usually tied to feeling tired. It doesn\u2019t really affect how I handle things day to day.\nDoctor: That helps clear things up, Claire. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: Yes, there have been some changes in my appetite and a bit of weight fluctuation, but nothing too dramatic or concerning.\nDoctor: Can you tell me more about these changes, Claire? Are you eating more or less than usual, and over what time frame have you noticed these shifts in appetite and weight? Understanding this helps me see how things are affecting you overall.\nPatient: My appetite has gone up and down a bit recently, so some days I eat more, and others less. I\u2019ve noticed some minor changes in weight, but nothing that feels like a major issue. It\u2019s been over the past few weeks.\nDoctor: Claire, how often do these ups and downs in appetite happen? Do you notice if certain times or situations affect your eating more? Also, do the changes in weight line up with when your mood or energy shifts? And do these fluctuations affect how you feel physically or get through your day?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nClaire, how often do these ups and downs in appetite happen?

I want to get a clear picture of how this impacts your daily life.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any ongoing trouble concentrating or making decisions. When concentration feels off, it\u2019s just occasional and usually tied to feeling tired. It doesn\u2019t really affect how I handle things day to day.\nDoctor: That helps clear things up, Claire. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: Yes, there have been some changes in my appetite and a bit of weight fluctuation, but nothing too dramatic or concerning.\nDoctor: Can you tell me more about these changes, Claire? Are you eating more or less than usual, and over what time frame have you noticed these shifts in appetite and weight? Understanding this helps me see how things are affecting you overall.\nPatient: My appetite has gone up and down a bit recently, so some days I eat more, and others less. I\u2019ve noticed some minor changes in weight, but nothing that feels like a major issue. It\u2019s been over the past few weeks.\nDoctor: Claire, how often do these ups and downs in appetite happen? Do you notice if certain times or situations affect your eating more? Also, do the changes in weight line up with when your mood or energy shifts? And do these fluctuations affect how you feel physically or get through your day?\nPatient: The changes in appetite happen off and on without any clear pattern. The weight shifts have been minor and don\u2019t seem closely tied to how my mood or energy is. Overall, these fluctuations don\u2019t really affect how I feel physically or my ability to get through the day.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nThe changes in appetite happen off and on without any clear pattern.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hello. Lately, I've been feeling a bit off, mostly tired more than usual. Nothing extreme, just a general sense of low energy that comes and goes. Otherwise, things have been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say the low energy comes and goes, can you tell me more about when it tends to show up? How long does it usually last, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day activities? Have you noticed any particular triggers or patterns around it?\nPatient: It tends to come and go throughout the day, sometimes more noticeable in the afternoons. The tiredness can last a few hours, but it doesn\u2019t really stop me from getting things done. I wouldn\u2019t say it has a major effect on my daily routine. I haven't really picked up on any specific triggers or patterns.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. Let\u2019s talk about your sleep for a moment\u2014are you having any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling refreshed?\nPatient: No, my sleep has been fairly normal. I don\u2019t have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, and I usually feel okay when I wake up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear your sleep is steady, Claire. How about your mood\u2014have you been feeling down or sad recently?\nPatient: I have felt down at times, though not too often or too deeply. It\u2019s more like a low mood that passes rather than something that really overwhelms me.\nDoctor: When you feel this low mood, Claire, how long does it usually last? Are there certain situations that seem to bring it on more? What do you usually do to manage or cope when these feelings come up?\nPatient: The low moods tend to be brief and come and go without lasting for too long. I haven't noticed any particular situations that clearly trigger them. Usually, I just keep going with my routine and try to focus on what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Claire, how do these brief low moods affect how you feel overall during the day? When you push through them and keep up with your routine, does that feel manageable most of the time, or do you notice it wearing you down?\nPatient: For the most part, pushing through those low moods feels manageable. They don't seem to wear me down too much since they don\u2019t last very long. Sticking to my routine helps keep things steady.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Claire. During those low moods, do you notice any changes in your motivation or energy to do things? Does staying on your routine ever feel like a struggle, even just a little?\nPatient: Yes, my motivation and energy do dip somewhat during those times. It takes a bit more effort, but I\u2019m usually still able to keep up with my routine without too much difficulty.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to check in about how things you normally enjoy feel right now. Have you noticed any changes\u2014like having less interest or pleasure in activities you usually like, especially during times when your mood or energy dips?\nPatient: There have been times when things I usually enjoy feel less interesting or satisfying, though it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more occasional and doesn\u2019t really stop me from doing those things.\nDoctor: Can you tell me about some specific activities that have felt less interesting or satisfying lately, Claire? How often does this happen, and do you find it affects your mood or motivation when it does?\nPatient: Sometimes, activities like reading or watching movies feel a bit less interesting than usual. It happens occasionally rather than all the time. When it does, it might lower my mood or motivation just a little, but not significantly.\nDoctor: Claire, when reading or watching movies feel less interesting, what does that actually feel like for you? How often do those moments come up, how long do they last, and what do you usually do to manage or get through them?\nPatient: When reading or watching movies feel less interesting, it mostly just feels a bit dull or unengaging. Those moments come up occasionally and usually don\u2019t last very long. I more or less push through or distract myself without making a big deal out of it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling any times recently where you felt worthless or overly guilty about things, even when you think those feelings might not match the situation?\nPatient: That doesn\u2019t happen very often. I might feel that way once in a while, but it\u2019s rare and doesn\u2019t really stick with me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s completely normal to have those feelings now and then, Claire, especially with everything you\u2019re navigating. I appreciate you being open about it. If it ever feels like more or starts to linger, I\u2019m here to talk it through whenever you\u2019re ready.\nPatient: Thank you. I appreciate that. Like I mentioned, those feelings are rare and don\u2019t really last long when they do come up. It\u2019s good to know you\u2019re available if it ever changes.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to ask something important\u2014have you had any thoughts about death, or about hurting yourself, even if just briefly or occasionally? It\u2019s okay to be honest here.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some thoughts like that, but they\u2019re very rare and don\u2019t last long.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Claire. It can be tough to talk about. Can you tell me how often these thoughts come up? Do you have any thoughts about how you would act on them, or a plan? What do you usually do when you have these thoughts?\nPatient: Those thoughts come up very rarely and don\u2019t really stick around. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent with them. Usually, I try to distract myself or push the thoughts away when they do happen.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say these thoughts come up rarely, how often would you say that is? And how well do you feel your ways of coping\u2014like distracting yourself\u2014are working when those thoughts pop up? It\u2019s good you have ways to manage; I want to make sure you feel safe sharing here.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s not more than once every few weeks, maybe even less often. Distraction usually helps enough to keep things from becoming too difficult. I do feel safe sharing this with you.\nDoctor: Claire, since you mentioned feeling tired and low in energy earlier, I want to understand that a bit better. How often do you notice these feelings during your day, and how much do they affect what you\u2019re able to do? It sounds like you\u2019ve been managing quite a bit.\nPatient: I notice feeling tired or low in energy fairly often, maybe a few times throughout the day. It\u2019s noticeable, but it doesn\u2019t usually stop me from doing what needs to be done. I mostly manage by pushing myself to keep going despite the fatigue.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re working hard to keep things on track, Claire. When you feel that tiredness, does it ever make it harder to concentrate or make decisions during the day?\nPatient: Sometimes when I\u2019m tired, concentration feels a bit off, but my ability to make decisions doesn\u2019t seem noticeably affected. The fatigue affects my overall energy more than my thinking.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying that, Claire. Apart from the times you feel tired, have you noticed any ongoing trouble concentrating or making decisions? If so, can you share some examples or situations where that happens? I want to get a clear picture of how this impacts your daily life.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any ongoing trouble concentrating or making decisions. When concentration feels off, it\u2019s just occasional and usually tied to feeling tired. It doesn\u2019t really affect how I handle things day to day.\nDoctor: That helps clear things up, Claire. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: Yes, there have been some changes in my appetite and a bit of weight fluctuation, but nothing too dramatic or concerning.\nDoctor: Can you tell me more about these changes, Claire?

I don\u2019t have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, and I usually feel okay when I wake up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear your sleep is steady, Claire. How about your mood\u2014have you been feeling down or sad recently?\nPatient: I have felt down at times, though not too often or too deeply. It\u2019s more like a low mood that passes rather than something that really overwhelms me.\nDoctor: When you feel this low mood, Claire, how long does it usually last? Are there certain situations that seem to bring it on more? What do you usually do to manage or cope when these feelings come up?\nPatient: The low moods tend to be brief and come and go without lasting for too long. I haven't noticed any particular situations that clearly trigger them. Usually, I just keep going with my routine and try to focus on what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Claire, how do these brief low moods affect how you feel overall during the day? When you push through them and keep up with your routine, does that feel manageable most of the time, or do you notice it wearing you down?\nPatient: For the most part, pushing through those low moods feels manageable. They don't seem to wear me down too much since they don\u2019t last very long. Sticking to my routine helps keep things steady.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Claire. During those low moods, do you notice any changes in your motivation or energy to do things? Does staying on your routine ever feel like a struggle, even just a little?\nPatient: Yes, my motivation and energy do dip somewhat during those times. It takes a bit more effort, but I\u2019m usually still able to keep up with my routine without too much difficulty.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to check in about how things you normally enjoy feel right now. Have you noticed any changes\u2014like having less interest or pleasure in activities you usually like, especially during times when your mood or energy dips?\nPatient: There have been times when things I usually enjoy feel less interesting or satisfying, though it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more occasional and doesn\u2019t really stop me from doing those things.\nDoctor: Can you tell me about some specific activities that have felt less interesting or satisfying lately, Claire? How often does this happen, and do you find it affects your mood or motivation when it does?\nPatient: Sometimes, activities like reading or watching movies feel a bit less interesting than usual. It happens occasionally rather than all the time. When it does, it might lower my mood or motivation just a little, but not significantly.\nDoctor: Claire, when reading or watching movies feel less interesting, what does that actually feel like for you? How often do those moments come up, how long do they last, and what do you usually do to manage or get through them?\nPatient: When reading or watching movies feel less interesting, it mostly just feels a bit dull or unengaging. Those moments come up occasionally and usually don\u2019t last very long. I more or less push through or distract myself without making a big deal out of it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Claire. I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling any times recently where you felt worthless or overly guilty about things, even when you think those feelings might not match the situation?\nPatient: That doesn\u2019t happen very often. I might feel that way once in a while, but it\u2019s rare and doesn\u2019t really stick with me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s completely normal to have those feelings now and then, Claire, especially with everything you\u2019re navigating. I appreciate you being open about it. If it ever feels like more or starts to linger, I\u2019m here to talk it through whenever you\u2019re ready.\nPatient: Thank you. I appreciate that. Like I mentioned, those feelings are rare and don\u2019t really last long when they do come up. It\u2019s good to know you\u2019re available if it ever changes.\nDoctor: Claire, I want to ask something important\u2014have you had any thoughts about death, or about hurting yourself, even if just briefly or occasionally? It\u2019s okay to be honest here.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some thoughts like that, but they\u2019re very rare and don\u2019t last long.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Claire. It can be tough to talk about. Can you tell me how often these thoughts come up? Do you have any thoughts about how you would act on them, or a plan? What do you usually do when you have these thoughts?\nPatient: Those thoughts come up very rarely and don\u2019t really stick around. I don\u2019t have any plan or intent with them. Usually, I try to distract myself or push the thoughts away when they do happen.\nDoctor: Claire, when you say these thoughts come up rarely, how often would you say that is? And how well do you feel your ways of coping\u2014like distracting yourself\u2014are working when those thoughts pop up? It\u2019s good you have ways to manage; I want to make sure you feel safe sharing here.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s not more than once every few weeks, maybe even less often. Distraction usually helps enough to keep things from becoming too difficult. I do feel safe sharing this with you.\nDoctor: Claire, since you mentioned feeling tired and low in energy earlier, I want to understand that a bit better. How often do you notice these feelings during your day, and how much do they affect what you\u2019re able to do? It sounds like you\u2019ve been managing quite a bit.\nPatient: I notice feeling tired or low in energy fairly often, maybe a few times throughout the day. It\u2019s noticeable, but it doesn\u2019t usually stop me from doing what needs to be done. I mostly manage by pushing myself to keep going despite the fatigue.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re working hard to keep things on track, Claire. When you feel that tiredness, does it ever make it harder to concentrate or make decisions during the day?\nPatient: Sometimes when I\u2019m tired, concentration feels a bit off, but my ability to make decisions doesn\u2019t seem noticeably affected. The fatigue affects my overall energy more than my thinking.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying that, Claire. Apart from the times you feel tired, have you noticed any ongoing trouble concentrating or making decisions? If so, can you share some examples or situations where that happens? I want to get a clear picture of how this impacts your daily life.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any ongoing trouble concentrating or making decisions. When concentration feels off, it\u2019s just occasional and usually tied to feeling tired. It doesn\u2019t really affect how I handle things day to day.\nDoctor: That helps clear things up, Claire. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: Yes, there have been some changes in my appetite and a bit of weight fluctuation, but nothing too dramatic or concerning.\nDoctor: Can you tell me more about these changes, Claire? Are you eating more or less than usual, and over what time frame have you noticed these shifts in appetite and weight? Understanding this helps me see how things are affecting you overall.\nPatient: My appetite has gone up and down a bit recently, so some days I eat more, and others less. I\u2019ve noticed some minor changes in weight, but nothing that feels like a major issue. It\u2019s been over the past few weeks.\nDoctor: Claire, how often do these ups and downs in appetite happen? Do you notice if certain times or situations affect your eating more? Also, do the changes in weight line up with when your mood or energy shifts? And do these fluctuations affect how you feel physically or get through your day?\nPatient: The changes in appetite happen off and on without any clear pattern. The weight shifts have been minor and don\u2019t seem closely tied to how my mood or energy is. Overall, these fluctuations don\u2019t really affect how I feel physically or my ability to get through the day.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that, Claire. I want to ask\u2014have you noticed any changes in how fast your body or mind feels? Like, do you ever feel physically slowed down in your movements or speech, or on the flip side, restless or fidgety?\nPatient: Sometimes I do notice feeling a bit slowed down or restless, but it\u2019s occasional and not too intense. It doesn\u2019t happen very often or interfere much.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
