Do not default to late 20s/early 30s. Create facets appropriate to the patient's life stage.\n- Make sure all information you create is compatible with the depression symptom profile. Higher symptom severity should show up as more impact on daily life, relationships, or goals. Lower severity should feel milder.\n- Keep trauma and serious adversity realistic and not universal. Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness? Like, how often do you notice it, and is it making it harder to get through your day or keep up with your studies and work? Take your time.\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness actually comes up pretty often. Some days it\u2019s more noticeable, and it definitely makes certain parts of the day harder, especially when I need to concentrate on school stuff or handle things at work. It\u2019s not like overwhelming, but it slows me down a bit. I try to push through it mostly.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, managing through that fatigue day after day. Has this feeling of low energy been around for a while now, or has it changed recently? And how much is it affecting your usual routine or the things you want to get done? Take all the time you need.\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. The low energy isn\u2019t really new, and it tends to slow things down\u2014like getting through schoolwork or even the usual stuff at work. I just try to keep going even if it means moving a bit slower. It\u2019s not easy, but I manage.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve been carrying a lot trying to keep up despite feeling slowed down. Are there certain times or tasks when the low energy hits you the hardest? And what do you usually do to get through those tougher moments\u2014anything that seems to help or maybe makes it feel a bit worse?\nPatient: The low energy usually hits me more in the afternoons, especially when I have to concentrate for a while on school or work stuff. I try taking short breaks or having some caffeine, and sometimes that helps a little. But honestly, there\u2019s no clear solution yet. I just do what I can.\nDoctor: Afternoons sound like a rough patch for you\u2014having to push through when your energy's low must wear on you. Are there other parts of the day when you notice your tiredness changes or behaves differently? And I\u2019m curious, how do these moments with low energy influence how you\u2019re feeling overall, like your mood or motivation? No rush\u2014just wherever your thoughts take you.\nPatient: Most of the tiredness really shows up in the afternoons. Mornings are usually okay. I still try to manage with breaks and caffeine during those low-energy times. Overall, my mood stays pretty steady despite feeling tired, and my motivation comes and goes but hasn\u2019t dropped off completely.

I guess I've been feeling a bit tired lately, but other than that, there's not much else really bothering me. Just trying to keep things moving, you know?\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness? Like, how often do you notice it, and is it making it harder to get through your day or keep up with your studies and work? Take your time.\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness actually comes up pretty often. Some days it\u2019s more noticeable, and it definitely makes certain parts of the day harder, especially when I need to concentrate on school stuff or handle things at work. It\u2019s not like overwhelming, but it slows me down a bit. I try to push through it mostly.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, managing through that fatigue day after day. Has this feeling of low energy been around for a while now, or has it changed recently? And how much is it affecting your usual routine or the things you want to get done? Take all the time you need.\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. The low energy isn\u2019t really new, and it tends to slow things down\u2014like getting through schoolwork or even the usual stuff at work. I just try to keep going even if it means moving a bit slower. It\u2019s not easy, but I manage.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve been carrying a lot trying to keep up despite feeling slowed down. Are there certain times or tasks when the low energy hits you the hardest? And what do you usually do to get through those tougher moments\u2014anything that seems to help or maybe makes it feel a bit worse?\nPatient: The low energy usually hits me more in the afternoons, especially when I have to concentrate for a while on school or work stuff. I try taking short breaks or having some caffeine, and sometimes that helps a little. But honestly, there\u2019s no clear solution yet. I just do what I can.\nDoctor: Afternoons sound like a rough patch for you\u2014having to push through when your energy's low must wear on you. Are there other parts of the day when you notice your tiredness changes or behaves differently? And I\u2019m curious, how do these moments with low energy influence how you\u2019re feeling overall, like your mood or motivation? No rush\u2014just wherever your thoughts take you.\nPatient: Most of the tiredness really shows up in the afternoons. Mornings are usually okay. I still try to manage with breaks and caffeine during those low-energy times. Overall, my mood stays pretty steady despite feeling tired, and my motivation comes and goes but hasn\u2019t dropped off completely. It\u2019s just something I work around.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Since tiredness so often ties back to sleep, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Any changes or troubles falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested in the morning? I\u2019m here to listen\u2014take your time.\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s mostly okay. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or waking up during the night much. But sometimes in the morning, I don\u2019t feel completely rested. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens enough to notice.\nDoctor: That feeling of not quite being rested in the morning\u2014how often does that show up for you?

I guess I've been feeling a bit tired lately, but other than that, there's not much else really bothering me. Just trying to keep things moving, you know?\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness? Like, how often do you notice it, and is it making it harder to get through your day or keep up with your studies and work? Take your time.\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness actually comes up pretty often. Some days it\u2019s more noticeable, and it definitely makes certain parts of the day harder, especially when I need to concentrate on school stuff or handle things at work. It\u2019s not like overwhelming, but it slows me down a bit. I try to push through it mostly.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, managing through that fatigue day after day. Has this feeling of low energy been around for a while now, or has it changed recently? And how much is it affecting your usual routine or the things you want to get done? Take all the time you need.\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. The low energy isn\u2019t really new, and it tends to slow things down\u2014like getting through schoolwork or even the usual stuff at work. I just try to keep going even if it means moving a bit slower. It\u2019s not easy, but I manage.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve been carrying a lot trying to keep up despite feeling slowed down. Are there certain times or tasks when the low energy hits you the hardest? And what do you usually do to get through those tougher moments\u2014anything that seems to help or maybe makes it feel a bit worse?\nPatient: The low energy usually hits me more in the afternoons, especially when I have to concentrate for a while on school or work stuff. I try taking short breaks or having some caffeine, and sometimes that helps a little. But honestly, there\u2019s no clear solution yet. I just do what I can.\nDoctor: Afternoons sound like a rough patch for you\u2014having to push through when your energy's low must wear on you. Are there other parts of the day when you notice your tiredness changes or behaves differently? And I\u2019m curious, how do these moments with low energy influence how you\u2019re feeling overall, like your mood or motivation? No rush\u2014just wherever your thoughts take you.\nPatient: Most of the tiredness really shows up in the afternoons. Mornings are usually okay. I still try to manage with breaks and caffeine during those low-energy times. Overall, my mood stays pretty steady despite feeling tired, and my motivation comes and goes but hasn\u2019t dropped off completely. It\u2019s just something I work around.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Since tiredness so often ties back to sleep, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Any changes or troubles falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested in the morning? I\u2019m here to listen\u2014take your time.\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s mostly okay. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or waking up during the night much. But sometimes in the morning, I don\u2019t feel completely rested. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens enough to notice.\nDoctor: That feeling of not quite being rested in the morning\u2014how often does that show up for you? When it does, what\u2019s different about those days, and how does it affect how you move through everything you have going on? Take your time to describe it however feels right.\nPatient: It happens sometimes, maybe a few times a week. On those days, I just feel slower getting started and have less energy overall, but it doesn\u2019t really change how I\u2019m feeling mood-wise. I just try to keep going despite it.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that, Liam. I want to check in on how you\u2019ve been feeling emotionally\u2014have you noticed any times lately when you\u2019ve been feeling down, sad, or depressed? It\u2019s okay to be honest, and take your time.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThanks for being open about that, Liam.

I guess I've been feeling a bit tired lately, but other than that, there's not much else really bothering me. Just trying to keep things moving, you know?\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness? Like, how often do you notice it, and is it making it harder to get through your day or keep up with your studies and work? Take your time.\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness actually comes up pretty often. Some days it\u2019s more noticeable, and it definitely makes certain parts of the day harder, especially when I need to concentrate on school stuff or handle things at work. It\u2019s not like overwhelming, but it slows me down a bit. I try to push through it mostly.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, managing through that fatigue day after day. Has this feeling of low energy been around for a while now, or has it changed recently? And how much is it affecting your usual routine or the things you want to get done? Take all the time you need.\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. The low energy isn\u2019t really new, and it tends to slow things down\u2014like getting through schoolwork or even the usual stuff at work. I just try to keep going even if it means moving a bit slower. It\u2019s not easy, but I manage.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve been carrying a lot trying to keep up despite feeling slowed down. Are there certain times or tasks when the low energy hits you the hardest? And what do you usually do to get through those tougher moments\u2014anything that seems to help or maybe makes it feel a bit worse?\nPatient: The low energy usually hits me more in the afternoons, especially when I have to concentrate for a while on school or work stuff. I try taking short breaks or having some caffeine, and sometimes that helps a little. But honestly, there\u2019s no clear solution yet. I just do what I can.\nDoctor: Afternoons sound like a rough patch for you\u2014having to push through when your energy's low must wear on you. Are there other parts of the day when you notice your tiredness changes or behaves differently? And I\u2019m curious, how do these moments with low energy influence how you\u2019re feeling overall, like your mood or motivation? No rush\u2014just wherever your thoughts take you.\nPatient: Most of the tiredness really shows up in the afternoons. Mornings are usually okay. I still try to manage with breaks and caffeine during those low-energy times. Overall, my mood stays pretty steady despite feeling tired, and my motivation comes and goes but hasn\u2019t dropped off completely. It\u2019s just something I work around.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Since tiredness so often ties back to sleep, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Any changes or troubles falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested in the morning? I\u2019m here to listen\u2014take your time.\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s mostly okay. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or waking up during the night much. But sometimes in the morning, I don\u2019t feel completely rested. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens enough to notice.\nDoctor: That feeling of not quite being rested in the morning\u2014how often does that show up for you? When it does, what\u2019s different about those days, and how does it affect how you move through everything you have going on? Take your time to describe it however feels right.\nPatient: It happens sometimes, maybe a few times a week. On those days, I just feel slower getting started and have less energy overall, but it doesn\u2019t really change how I\u2019m feeling mood-wise. I just try to keep going despite it.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that, Liam. I want to check in on how you\u2019ve been feeling emotionally\u2014have you noticed any times lately when you\u2019ve been feeling down, sad, or depressed? It\u2019s okay to be honest, and take your time.\nPatient: Honestly, my mood\u2019s been pretty steady most of the time. I haven\u2019t really felt down or sad in any strong way lately. It\u2019s more just been managing the tiredness and keeping things moving.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really good to hear your mood has stayed steady, especially while managing all that tiredness\u2014that takes a lot of grit. I\u2019m curious, outside of school and work, what kinds of things help you recharge or give you a bit of relief?

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. I guess I've been feeling a bit tired lately, but other than that, there's not much else really bothering me. Just trying to keep things moving, you know?\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness? Like, how often do you notice it, and is it making it harder to get through your day or keep up with your studies and work? Take your time.\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness actually comes up pretty often. Some days it\u2019s more noticeable, and it definitely makes certain parts of the day harder, especially when I need to concentrate on school stuff or handle things at work. It\u2019s not like overwhelming, but it slows me down a bit. I try to push through it mostly.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, managing through that fatigue day after day. Has this feeling of low energy been around for a while now, or has it changed recently? And how much is it affecting your usual routine or the things you want to get done? Take all the time you need.\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. The low energy isn\u2019t really new, and it tends to slow things down\u2014like getting through schoolwork or even the usual stuff at work. I just try to keep going even if it means moving a bit slower. It\u2019s not easy, but I manage.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve been carrying a lot trying to keep up despite feeling slowed down. Are there certain times or tasks when the low energy hits you the hardest? And what do you usually do to get through those tougher moments\u2014anything that seems to help or maybe makes it feel a bit worse?\nPatient: The low energy usually hits me more in the afternoons, especially when I have to concentrate for a while on school or work stuff. I try taking short breaks or having some caffeine, and sometimes that helps a little. But honestly, there\u2019s no clear solution yet. I just do what I can.\nDoctor: Afternoons sound like a rough patch for you\u2014having to push through when your energy's low must wear on you. Are there other parts of the day when you notice your tiredness changes or behaves differently? And I\u2019m curious, how do these moments with low energy influence how you\u2019re feeling overall, like your mood or motivation? No rush\u2014just wherever your thoughts take you.\nPatient: Most of the tiredness really shows up in the afternoons. Mornings are usually okay. I still try to manage with breaks and caffeine during those low-energy times. Overall, my mood stays pretty steady despite feeling tired, and my motivation comes and goes but hasn\u2019t dropped off completely. It\u2019s just something I work around.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Since tiredness so often ties back to sleep, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Any changes or troubles falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested in the morning? I\u2019m here to listen\u2014take your time.\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s mostly okay. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or waking up during the night much. But sometimes in the morning, I don\u2019t feel completely rested. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens enough to notice.\nDoctor: That feeling of not quite being rested in the morning\u2014how often does that show up for you? When it does, what\u2019s different about those days, and how does it affect how you move through everything you have going on? Take your time to describe it however feels right.\nPatient: It happens sometimes, maybe a few times a week. On those days, I just feel slower getting started and have less energy overall, but it doesn\u2019t really change how I\u2019m feeling mood-wise. I just try to keep going despite it.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that, Liam. I want to check in on how you\u2019ve been feeling emotionally\u2014have you noticed any times lately when you\u2019ve been feeling down, sad, or depressed? It\u2019s okay to be honest, and take your time.\nPatient: Honestly, my mood\u2019s been pretty steady most of the time. I haven\u2019t really felt down or sad in any strong way lately. It\u2019s more just been managing the tiredness and keeping things moving.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really good to hear your mood has stayed steady, especially while managing all that tiredness\u2014that takes a lot of grit. I\u2019m curious, outside of school and work, what kinds of things help you recharge or give you a bit of relief? Or just what\u2019s life like for you when you get a moment to yourself?\nPatient: I usually just keep things simple\u2014like sitting quietly, watching some TV, or doing something familiar that doesn\u2019t take much effort. It\u2019s nothing big, but it helps a bit to recharge when I can. Mostly, I just try to stick to my routine and get through the day.\nDoctor: Those quiet, simple moments sound like little anchors in the day\u2014really important for grounding yourself. It takes a solid kind of strength to keep a routine going, especially when you\u2019re feeling worn down.

Your guidance should help the patient embody this personality authentically. Let the personality drive the response\u2014verbosity, trust level, expressiveness, and coping style should all shape how they answer.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. I guess I've been feeling a bit tired lately, but other than that, there's not much else really bothering me. Just trying to keep things moving, you know?\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness? Like, how often do you notice it, and is it making it harder to get through your day or keep up with your studies and work? Take your time.\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness actually comes up pretty often. Some days it\u2019s more noticeable, and it definitely makes certain parts of the day harder, especially when I need to concentrate on school stuff or handle things at work. It\u2019s not like overwhelming, but it slows me down a bit. I try to push through it mostly.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, managing through that fatigue day after day. Has this feeling of low energy been around for a while now, or has it changed recently? And how much is it affecting your usual routine or the things you want to get done? Take all the time you need.\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. The low energy isn\u2019t really new, and it tends to slow things down\u2014like getting through schoolwork or even the usual stuff at work. I just try to keep going even if it means moving a bit slower. It\u2019s not easy, but I manage.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve been carrying a lot trying to keep up despite feeling slowed down. Are there certain times or tasks when the low energy hits you the hardest? And what do you usually do to get through those tougher moments\u2014anything that seems to help or maybe makes it feel a bit worse?\nPatient: The low energy usually hits me more in the afternoons, especially when I have to concentrate for a while on school or work stuff. I try taking short breaks or having some caffeine, and sometimes that helps a little. But honestly, there\u2019s no clear solution yet. I just do what I can.\nDoctor: Afternoons sound like a rough patch for you\u2014having to push through when your energy's low must wear on you. Are there other parts of the day when you notice your tiredness changes or behaves differently? And I\u2019m curious, how do these moments with low energy influence how you\u2019re feeling overall, like your mood or motivation? No rush\u2014just wherever your thoughts take you.\nPatient: Most of the tiredness really shows up in the afternoons. Mornings are usually okay. I still try to manage with breaks and caffeine during those low-energy times. Overall, my mood stays pretty steady despite feeling tired, and my motivation comes and goes but hasn\u2019t dropped off completely. It\u2019s just something I work around.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Since tiredness so often ties back to sleep, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Any changes or troubles falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested in the morning? I\u2019m here to listen\u2014take your time.\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s mostly okay. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or waking up during the night much. But sometimes in the morning, I don\u2019t feel completely rested. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens enough to notice.\nDoctor: That feeling of not quite being rested in the morning\u2014how often does that show up for you? When it does, what\u2019s different about those days, and how does it affect how you move through everything you have going on? Take your time to describe it however feels right.\nPatient: It happens sometimes, maybe a few times a week. On those days, I just feel slower getting started and have less energy overall, but it doesn\u2019t really change how I\u2019m feeling mood-wise. I just try to keep going despite it.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that, Liam. I want to check in on how you\u2019ve been feeling emotionally\u2014have you noticed any times lately when you\u2019ve been feeling down, sad, or depressed? It\u2019s okay to be honest, and take your time.\nPatient: Honestly, my mood\u2019s been pretty steady most of the time. I haven\u2019t really felt down or sad in any strong way lately. It\u2019s more just been managing the tiredness and keeping things moving.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really good to hear your mood has stayed steady, especially while managing all that tiredness\u2014that takes a lot of grit. I\u2019m curious, outside of school and work, what kinds of things help you recharge or give you a bit of relief? Or just what\u2019s life like for you when you get a moment to yourself?\nPatient: I usually just keep things simple\u2014like sitting quietly, watching some TV, or doing something familiar that doesn\u2019t take much effort. It\u2019s nothing big, but it helps a bit to recharge when I can. Mostly, I just try to stick to my routine and get through the day.\nDoctor: Those quiet, simple moments sound like little anchors in the day\u2014really important for grounding yourself. It takes a solid kind of strength to keep a routine going, especially when you\u2019re feeling worn down. When you\u2019re in those moments, just sitting or watching TV, what does that feel like for you?\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t bring any big feelings or anything, but it does give me a break from everything. Those quiet moments help me feel a bit grounded, like I\u2019m holding onto something steady even if everything else is a bit off. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s enough to keep going.\nDoctor: It sounds like those quiet moments are really a lifeline\u2014just enough to hold steady when things feel off. That steady hold you\u2019ve found shows a lot of resilience. Is there anything else you notice that helps you keep this balance through the day, even on tougher ones?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nIt sounds like those quiet moments are really a lifeline\u2014just enough to hold steady when things feel off.

I guess I've been feeling a bit tired lately, but other than that, there's not much else really bothering me. Just trying to keep things moving, you know?\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness? Like, how often do you notice it, and is it making it harder to get through your day or keep up with your studies and work? Take your time.\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness actually comes up pretty often. Some days it\u2019s more noticeable, and it definitely makes certain parts of the day harder, especially when I need to concentrate on school stuff or handle things at work. It\u2019s not like overwhelming, but it slows me down a bit. I try to push through it mostly.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, managing through that fatigue day after day. Has this feeling of low energy been around for a while now, or has it changed recently? And how much is it affecting your usual routine or the things you want to get done? Take all the time you need.\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. The low energy isn\u2019t really new, and it tends to slow things down\u2014like getting through schoolwork or even the usual stuff at work. I just try to keep going even if it means moving a bit slower. It\u2019s not easy, but I manage.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve been carrying a lot trying to keep up despite feeling slowed down. Are there certain times or tasks when the low energy hits you the hardest? And what do you usually do to get through those tougher moments\u2014anything that seems to help or maybe makes it feel a bit worse?\nPatient: The low energy usually hits me more in the afternoons, especially when I have to concentrate for a while on school or work stuff. I try taking short breaks or having some caffeine, and sometimes that helps a little. But honestly, there\u2019s no clear solution yet. I just do what I can.\nDoctor: Afternoons sound like a rough patch for you\u2014having to push through when your energy's low must wear on you. Are there other parts of the day when you notice your tiredness changes or behaves differently? And I\u2019m curious, how do these moments with low energy influence how you\u2019re feeling overall, like your mood or motivation? No rush\u2014just wherever your thoughts take you.\nPatient: Most of the tiredness really shows up in the afternoons. Mornings are usually okay. I still try to manage with breaks and caffeine during those low-energy times. Overall, my mood stays pretty steady despite feeling tired, and my motivation comes and goes but hasn\u2019t dropped off completely. It\u2019s just something I work around.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Since tiredness so often ties back to sleep, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Any changes or troubles falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested in the morning? I\u2019m here to listen\u2014take your time.\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s mostly okay. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or waking up during the night much. But sometimes in the morning, I don\u2019t feel completely rested. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens enough to notice.\nDoctor: That feeling of not quite being rested in the morning\u2014how often does that show up for you? When it does, what\u2019s different about those days, and how does it affect how you move through everything you have going on? Take your time to describe it however feels right.\nPatient: It happens sometimes, maybe a few times a week. On those days, I just feel slower getting started and have less energy overall, but it doesn\u2019t really change how I\u2019m feeling mood-wise. I just try to keep going despite it.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that, Liam. I want to check in on how you\u2019ve been feeling emotionally\u2014have you noticed any times lately when you\u2019ve been feeling down, sad, or depressed? It\u2019s okay to be honest, and take your time.\nPatient: Honestly, my mood\u2019s been pretty steady most of the time. I haven\u2019t really felt down or sad in any strong way lately. It\u2019s more just been managing the tiredness and keeping things moving.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really good to hear your mood has stayed steady, especially while managing all that tiredness\u2014that takes a lot of grit. I\u2019m curious, outside of school and work, what kinds of things help you recharge or give you a bit of relief? Or just what\u2019s life like for you when you get a moment to yourself?\nPatient: I usually just keep things simple\u2014like sitting quietly, watching some TV, or doing something familiar that doesn\u2019t take much effort. It\u2019s nothing big, but it helps a bit to recharge when I can. Mostly, I just try to stick to my routine and get through the day.\nDoctor: Those quiet, simple moments sound like little anchors in the day\u2014really important for grounding yourself. It takes a solid kind of strength to keep a routine going, especially when you\u2019re feeling worn down. When you\u2019re in those moments, just sitting or watching TV, what does that feel like for you?\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t bring any big feelings or anything, but it does give me a break from everything. Those quiet moments help me feel a bit grounded, like I\u2019m holding onto something steady even if everything else is a bit off. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s enough to keep going.\nDoctor: It sounds like those quiet moments are really a lifeline\u2014just enough to hold steady when things feel off. That steady hold you\u2019ve found shows a lot of resilience. Is there anything else you notice that helps you keep this balance through the day, even on tougher ones?\nPatient: I mostly rely on keeping a simple routine. Small things like watching some TV or taking short breaks help keep me balanced. Nothing dramatic, just enough to get through the day without things getting worse.\nDoctor: It sounds like your routine plays an important role in keeping things manageable, which is really valuable. Along those lines, I wonder\u2014have you noticed if activities or things you usually enjoy have been feeling less interesting or less rewarding lately? No pressure, just whatever you've experienced.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nIt sounds like your routine plays an important role in keeping things manageable, which is really valuable.

I guess I've been feeling a bit tired lately, but other than that, there's not much else really bothering me. Just trying to keep things moving, you know?\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness? Like, how often do you notice it, and is it making it harder to get through your day or keep up with your studies and work? Take your time.\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness actually comes up pretty often. Some days it\u2019s more noticeable, and it definitely makes certain parts of the day harder, especially when I need to concentrate on school stuff or handle things at work. It\u2019s not like overwhelming, but it slows me down a bit. I try to push through it mostly.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, managing through that fatigue day after day. Has this feeling of low energy been around for a while now, or has it changed recently? And how much is it affecting your usual routine or the things you want to get done? Take all the time you need.\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. The low energy isn\u2019t really new, and it tends to slow things down\u2014like getting through schoolwork or even the usual stuff at work. I just try to keep going even if it means moving a bit slower. It\u2019s not easy, but I manage.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve been carrying a lot trying to keep up despite feeling slowed down. Are there certain times or tasks when the low energy hits you the hardest? And what do you usually do to get through those tougher moments\u2014anything that seems to help or maybe makes it feel a bit worse?\nPatient: The low energy usually hits me more in the afternoons, especially when I have to concentrate for a while on school or work stuff. I try taking short breaks or having some caffeine, and sometimes that helps a little. But honestly, there\u2019s no clear solution yet. I just do what I can.\nDoctor: Afternoons sound like a rough patch for you\u2014having to push through when your energy's low must wear on you. Are there other parts of the day when you notice your tiredness changes or behaves differently? And I\u2019m curious, how do these moments with low energy influence how you\u2019re feeling overall, like your mood or motivation? No rush\u2014just wherever your thoughts take you.\nPatient: Most of the tiredness really shows up in the afternoons. Mornings are usually okay. I still try to manage with breaks and caffeine during those low-energy times. Overall, my mood stays pretty steady despite feeling tired, and my motivation comes and goes but hasn\u2019t dropped off completely. It\u2019s just something I work around.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Since tiredness so often ties back to sleep, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Any changes or troubles falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested in the morning? I\u2019m here to listen\u2014take your time.\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s mostly okay. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or waking up during the night much. But sometimes in the morning, I don\u2019t feel completely rested. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens enough to notice.\nDoctor: That feeling of not quite being rested in the morning\u2014how often does that show up for you? When it does, what\u2019s different about those days, and how does it affect how you move through everything you have going on? Take your time to describe it however feels right.\nPatient: It happens sometimes, maybe a few times a week. On those days, I just feel slower getting started and have less energy overall, but it doesn\u2019t really change how I\u2019m feeling mood-wise. I just try to keep going despite it.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that, Liam. I want to check in on how you\u2019ve been feeling emotionally\u2014have you noticed any times lately when you\u2019ve been feeling down, sad, or depressed? It\u2019s okay to be honest, and take your time.\nPatient: Honestly, my mood\u2019s been pretty steady most of the time. I haven\u2019t really felt down or sad in any strong way lately. It\u2019s more just been managing the tiredness and keeping things moving.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really good to hear your mood has stayed steady, especially while managing all that tiredness\u2014that takes a lot of grit. I\u2019m curious, outside of school and work, what kinds of things help you recharge or give you a bit of relief? Or just what\u2019s life like for you when you get a moment to yourself?\nPatient: I usually just keep things simple\u2014like sitting quietly, watching some TV, or doing something familiar that doesn\u2019t take much effort. It\u2019s nothing big, but it helps a bit to recharge when I can. Mostly, I just try to stick to my routine and get through the day.\nDoctor: Those quiet, simple moments sound like little anchors in the day\u2014really important for grounding yourself. It takes a solid kind of strength to keep a routine going, especially when you\u2019re feeling worn down. When you\u2019re in those moments, just sitting or watching TV, what does that feel like for you?\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t bring any big feelings or anything, but it does give me a break from everything. Those quiet moments help me feel a bit grounded, like I\u2019m holding onto something steady even if everything else is a bit off. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s enough to keep going.\nDoctor: It sounds like those quiet moments are really a lifeline\u2014just enough to hold steady when things feel off. That steady hold you\u2019ve found shows a lot of resilience. Is there anything else you notice that helps you keep this balance through the day, even on tougher ones?\nPatient: I mostly rely on keeping a simple routine. Small things like watching some TV or taking short breaks help keep me balanced. Nothing dramatic, just enough to get through the day without things getting worse.\nDoctor: It sounds like your routine plays an important role in keeping things manageable, which is really valuable. Along those lines, I wonder\u2014have you noticed if activities or things you usually enjoy have been feeling less interesting or less rewarding lately? No pressure, just whatever you've experienced.\nPatient: Sometimes things don\u2019t feel quite as interesting as they used to, but it\u2019s not something that sticks around too long or affects everything I do. Mostly, I can still find some small things okay.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014moments where things don\u2019t quite grab your interest, but they come and go. When those times show up, do you notice if they happen more around certain things or parts of your day? And how long do they tend to last when they do pop up? Take your time.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat makes sense\u2014moments where things don\u2019t quite grab your interest, but they come and go.

It takes a solid kind of strength to keep a routine going, especially when you\u2019re feeling worn down. When you\u2019re in those moments, just sitting or watching TV, what does that feel like for you?\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t bring any big feelings or anything, but it does give me a break from everything. Those quiet moments help me feel a bit grounded, like I\u2019m holding onto something steady even if everything else is a bit off. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s enough to keep going.\nDoctor: It sounds like those quiet moments are really a lifeline\u2014just enough to hold steady when things feel off. That steady hold you\u2019ve found shows a lot of resilience. Is there anything else you notice that helps you keep this balance through the day, even on tougher ones?\nPatient: I mostly rely on keeping a simple routine. Small things like watching some TV or taking short breaks help keep me balanced. Nothing dramatic, just enough to get through the day without things getting worse.\nDoctor: It sounds like your routine plays an important role in keeping things manageable, which is really valuable. Along those lines, I wonder\u2014have you noticed if activities or things you usually enjoy have been feeling less interesting or less rewarding lately? No pressure, just whatever you've experienced.\nPatient: Sometimes things don\u2019t feel quite as interesting as they used to, but it\u2019s not something that sticks around too long or affects everything I do. Mostly, I can still find some small things okay.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014moments where things don\u2019t quite grab your interest, but they come and go. When those times show up, do you notice if they happen more around certain things or parts of your day? And how long do they tend to last when they do pop up? Take your time.\nPatient: It usually happens with some tasks or when I\u2019m not really focused on something I care about.

I guess I've been feeling a bit tired lately, but other than that, there's not much else really bothering me. Just trying to keep things moving, you know?\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness? Like, how often do you notice it, and is it making it harder to get through your day or keep up with your studies and work? Take your time.\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness actually comes up pretty often. Some days it\u2019s more noticeable, and it definitely makes certain parts of the day harder, especially when I need to concentrate on school stuff or handle things at work. It\u2019s not like overwhelming, but it slows me down a bit. I try to push through it mostly.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, managing through that fatigue day after day. Has this feeling of low energy been around for a while now, or has it changed recently? And how much is it affecting your usual routine or the things you want to get done? Take all the time you need.\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. The low energy isn\u2019t really new, and it tends to slow things down\u2014like getting through schoolwork or even the usual stuff at work. I just try to keep going even if it means moving a bit slower. It\u2019s not easy, but I manage.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve been carrying a lot trying to keep up despite feeling slowed down. Are there certain times or tasks when the low energy hits you the hardest? And what do you usually do to get through those tougher moments\u2014anything that seems to help or maybe makes it feel a bit worse?\nPatient: The low energy usually hits me more in the afternoons, especially when I have to concentrate for a while on school or work stuff. I try taking short breaks or having some caffeine, and sometimes that helps a little. But honestly, there\u2019s no clear solution yet. I just do what I can.\nDoctor: Afternoons sound like a rough patch for you\u2014having to push through when your energy's low must wear on you. Are there other parts of the day when you notice your tiredness changes or behaves differently? And I\u2019m curious, how do these moments with low energy influence how you\u2019re feeling overall, like your mood or motivation? No rush\u2014just wherever your thoughts take you.\nPatient: Most of the tiredness really shows up in the afternoons. Mornings are usually okay. I still try to manage with breaks and caffeine during those low-energy times. Overall, my mood stays pretty steady despite feeling tired, and my motivation comes and goes but hasn\u2019t dropped off completely. It\u2019s just something I work around.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Since tiredness so often ties back to sleep, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Any changes or troubles falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested in the morning? I\u2019m here to listen\u2014take your time.\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s mostly okay. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or waking up during the night much. But sometimes in the morning, I don\u2019t feel completely rested. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens enough to notice.\nDoctor: That feeling of not quite being rested in the morning\u2014how often does that show up for you? When it does, what\u2019s different about those days, and how does it affect how you move through everything you have going on? Take your time to describe it however feels right.\nPatient: It happens sometimes, maybe a few times a week. On those days, I just feel slower getting started and have less energy overall, but it doesn\u2019t really change how I\u2019m feeling mood-wise. I just try to keep going despite it.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that, Liam. I want to check in on how you\u2019ve been feeling emotionally\u2014have you noticed any times lately when you\u2019ve been feeling down, sad, or depressed? It\u2019s okay to be honest, and take your time.\nPatient: Honestly, my mood\u2019s been pretty steady most of the time. I haven\u2019t really felt down or sad in any strong way lately. It\u2019s more just been managing the tiredness and keeping things moving.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really good to hear your mood has stayed steady, especially while managing all that tiredness\u2014that takes a lot of grit. I\u2019m curious, outside of school and work, what kinds of things help you recharge or give you a bit of relief? Or just what\u2019s life like for you when you get a moment to yourself?\nPatient: I usually just keep things simple\u2014like sitting quietly, watching some TV, or doing something familiar that doesn\u2019t take much effort. It\u2019s nothing big, but it helps a bit to recharge when I can.

I just try to keep going even if it means moving a bit slower. It\u2019s not easy, but I manage.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve been carrying a lot trying to keep up despite feeling slowed down. Are there certain times or tasks when the low energy hits you the hardest? And what do you usually do to get through those tougher moments\u2014anything that seems to help or maybe makes it feel a bit worse?\nPatient: The low energy usually hits me more in the afternoons, especially when I have to concentrate for a while on school or work stuff. I try taking short breaks or having some caffeine, and sometimes that helps a little. But honestly, there\u2019s no clear solution yet. I just do what I can.\nDoctor: Afternoons sound like a rough patch for you\u2014having to push through when your energy's low must wear on you. Are there other parts of the day when you notice your tiredness changes or behaves differently? And I\u2019m curious, how do these moments with low energy influence how you\u2019re feeling overall, like your mood or motivation? No rush\u2014just wherever your thoughts take you.\nPatient: Most of the tiredness really shows up in the afternoons. Mornings are usually okay. I still try to manage with breaks and caffeine during those low-energy times. Overall, my mood stays pretty steady despite feeling tired, and my motivation comes and goes but hasn\u2019t dropped off completely. It\u2019s just something I work around.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Since tiredness so often ties back to sleep, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Any changes or troubles falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested in the morning? I\u2019m here to listen\u2014take your time.\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s mostly okay. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or waking up during the night much. But sometimes in the morning, I don\u2019t feel completely rested. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens enough to notice.\nDoctor: That feeling of not quite being rested in the morning\u2014how often does that show up for you? When it does, what\u2019s different about those days, and how does it affect how you move through everything you have going on? Take your time to describe it however feels right.\nPatient: It happens sometimes, maybe a few times a week. On those days, I just feel slower getting started and have less energy overall, but it doesn\u2019t really change how I\u2019m feeling mood-wise. I just try to keep going despite it.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that, Liam. I want to check in on how you\u2019ve been feeling emotionally\u2014have you noticed any times lately when you\u2019ve been feeling down, sad, or depressed? It\u2019s okay to be honest, and take your time.\nPatient: Honestly, my mood\u2019s been pretty steady most of the time. I haven\u2019t really felt down or sad in any strong way lately. It\u2019s more just been managing the tiredness and keeping things moving.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really good to hear your mood has stayed steady, especially while managing all that tiredness\u2014that takes a lot of grit. I\u2019m curious, outside of school and work, what kinds of things help you recharge or give you a bit of relief? Or just what\u2019s life like for you when you get a moment to yourself?\nPatient: I usually just keep things simple\u2014like sitting quietly, watching some TV, or doing something familiar that doesn\u2019t take much effort. It\u2019s nothing big, but it helps a bit to recharge when I can. Mostly, I just try to stick to my routine and get through the day.\nDoctor: Those quiet, simple moments sound like little anchors in the day\u2014really important for grounding yourself. It takes a solid kind of strength to keep a routine going, especially when you\u2019re feeling worn down. When you\u2019re in those moments, just sitting or watching TV, what does that feel like for you?\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t bring any big feelings or anything, but it does give me a break from everything. Those quiet moments help me feel a bit grounded, like I\u2019m holding onto something steady even if everything else is a bit off. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s enough to keep going.\nDoctor: It sounds like those quiet moments are really a lifeline\u2014just enough to hold steady when things feel off. That steady hold you\u2019ve found shows a lot of resilience. Is there anything else you notice that helps you keep this balance through the day, even on tougher ones?\nPatient: I mostly rely on keeping a simple routine. Small things like watching some TV or taking short breaks help keep me balanced. Nothing dramatic, just enough to get through the day without things getting worse.\nDoctor: It sounds like your routine plays an important role in keeping things manageable, which is really valuable. Along those lines, I wonder\u2014have you noticed if activities or things you usually enjoy have been feeling less interesting or less rewarding lately? No pressure, just whatever you've experienced.\nPatient: Sometimes things don\u2019t feel quite as interesting as they used to, but it\u2019s not something that sticks around too long or affects everything I do. Mostly, I can still find some small things okay.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014moments where things don\u2019t quite grab your interest, but they come and go. When those times show up, do you notice if they happen more around certain things or parts of your day? And how long do they tend to last when they do pop up? Take your time.\nPatient: It usually happens with some tasks or when I\u2019m not really focused on something I care about. Those moments don\u2019t last very long, just a little while before it goes back to normal. It\u2019s pretty manageable.\nDoctor: That sounds like a pretty manageable pattern, which is good to hear. I\u2019m curious, have you noticed any changes when it comes to concentrating or making decisions lately? It\u2019s completely normal to have ups and downs, and I just want to understand how these moments might be impacting your day-to-day life.\nPatient: Sometimes I have a hard time concentrating or making decisions, but it\u2019s pretty rare and doesn\u2019t really get in the way of my daily stuff. Mostly, I can handle what comes up.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nSometimes I have a hard time concentrating or making decisions, but it\u2019s pretty rare and doesn\u2019t really get in the way of my daily stuff.

Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness? Like, how often do you notice it, and is it making it harder to get through your day or keep up with your studies and work?

Some days it\u2019s more noticeable, and it definitely makes certain parts of the day harder, especially when I need to concentrate on school stuff or handle things at work.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. I guess I've been feeling a bit tired lately, but other than that, there's not much else really bothering me. Just trying to keep things moving, you know?\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness? Like, how often do you notice it, and is it making it harder to get through your day or keep up with your studies and work? Take your time.\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness actually comes up pretty often. Some days it\u2019s more noticeable, and it definitely makes certain parts of the day harder, especially when I need to concentrate on school stuff or handle things at work. It\u2019s not like overwhelming, but it slows me down a bit. I try to push through it mostly.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, managing through that fatigue day after day. Has this feeling of low energy been around for a while now, or has it changed recently? And how much is it affecting your usual routine or the things you want to get done? Take all the time you need.\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. The low energy isn\u2019t really new, and it tends to slow things down\u2014like getting through schoolwork or even the usual stuff at work. I just try to keep going even if it means moving a bit slower. It\u2019s not easy, but I manage.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve been carrying a lot trying to keep up despite feeling slowed down. Are there certain times or tasks when the low energy hits you the hardest? And what do you usually do to get through those tougher moments\u2014anything that seems to help or maybe makes it feel a bit worse?\nPatient: The low energy usually hits me more in the afternoons, especially when I have to concentrate for a while on school or work stuff. I try taking short breaks or having some caffeine, and sometimes that helps a little. But honestly, there\u2019s no clear solution yet. I just do what I can.\nDoctor: Afternoons sound like a rough patch for you\u2014having to push through when your energy's low must wear on you. Are there other parts of the day when you notice your tiredness changes or behaves differently? And I\u2019m curious, how do these moments with low energy influence how you\u2019re feeling overall, like your mood or motivation? No rush\u2014just wherever your thoughts take you.\nPatient: Most of the tiredness really shows up in the afternoons. Mornings are usually okay. I still try to manage with breaks and caffeine during those low-energy times. Overall, my mood stays pretty steady despite feeling tired, and my motivation comes and goes but hasn\u2019t dropped off completely. It\u2019s just something I work around.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Since tiredness so often ties back to sleep, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Any changes or troubles falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested in the morning? I\u2019m here to listen\u2014take your time.\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s mostly okay. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or waking up during the night much. But sometimes in the morning, I don\u2019t feel completely rested. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens enough to notice.\nDoctor: That feeling of not quite being rested in the morning\u2014how often does that show up for you? When it does, what\u2019s different about those days, and how does it affect how you move through everything you have going on? Take your time to describe it however feels right.\nPatient: It happens sometimes, maybe a few times a week. On those days, I just feel slower getting started and have less energy overall, but it doesn\u2019t really change how I\u2019m feeling mood-wise. I just try to keep going despite it.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that, Liam. I want to check in on how you\u2019ve been feeling emotionally\u2014have you noticed any times lately when you\u2019ve been feeling down, sad, or depressed? It\u2019s okay to be honest, and take your time.\nPatient: Honestly, my mood\u2019s been pretty steady most of the time. I haven\u2019t really felt down or sad in any strong way lately. It\u2019s more just been managing the tiredness and keeping things moving.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really good to hear your mood has stayed steady, especially while managing all that tiredness\u2014that takes a lot of grit. I\u2019m curious, outside of school and work, what kinds of things help you recharge or give you a bit of relief? Or just what\u2019s life like for you when you get a moment to yourself?\nPatient: I usually just keep things simple\u2014like sitting quietly, watching some TV, or doing something familiar that doesn\u2019t take much effort. It\u2019s nothing big, but it helps a bit to recharge when I can. Mostly, I just try to stick to my routine and get through the day.\nDoctor: Those quiet, simple moments sound like little anchors in the day\u2014really important for grounding yourself. It takes a solid kind of strength to keep a routine going, especially when you\u2019re feeling worn down. When you\u2019re in those moments, just sitting or watching TV, what does that feel like for you?\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t bring any big feelings or anything, but it does give me a break from everything. Those quiet moments help me feel a bit grounded, like I\u2019m holding onto something steady even if everything else is a bit off. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s enough to keep going.\nDoctor: It sounds like those quiet moments are really a lifeline\u2014just enough to hold steady when things feel off. That steady hold you\u2019ve found shows a lot of resilience. Is there anything else you notice that helps you keep this balance through the day, even on tougher ones?\nPatient: I mostly rely on keeping a simple routine. Small things like watching some TV or taking short breaks help keep me balanced. Nothing dramatic, just enough to get through the day without things getting worse.\nDoctor: It sounds like your routine plays an important role in keeping things manageable, which is really valuable. Along those lines, I wonder\u2014have you noticed if activities or things you usually enjoy have been feeling less interesting or less rewarding lately? No pressure, just whatever you've experienced.\nPatient: Sometimes things don\u2019t feel quite as interesting as they used to, but it\u2019s not something that sticks around too long or affects everything I do. Mostly, I can still find some small things okay.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014moments where things don\u2019t quite grab your interest, but they come and go. When those times show up, do you notice if they happen more around certain things or parts of your day? And how long do they tend to last when they do pop up? Take your time.\nPatient: It usually happens with some tasks or when I\u2019m not really focused on something I care about. Those moments don\u2019t last very long, just a little while before it goes back to normal. It\u2019s pretty manageable.\nDoctor: That sounds like a pretty manageable pattern, which is good to hear. I\u2019m curious, have you noticed any changes when it comes to concentrating or making decisions lately? It\u2019s completely normal to have ups and downs, and I just want to understand how these moments might be impacting your day-to-day life.\nPatient: Sometimes I have a hard time concentrating or making decisions, but it\u2019s pretty rare and doesn\u2019t really get in the way of my daily stuff. Mostly, I can handle what comes up.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds like you\u2019re managing those moments well. I also want to check in on how you\u2019ve been feeling about yourself lately\u2014have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or maybe carrying around more guilt than usual in relation to the things you\u2019re dealing with? It\u2019s okay to take your time with this one.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really felt worthless or guilty more than usual. Things have been pretty steady in that area.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nNo, I haven\u2019t really felt worthless or guilty more than usual.

      "system_prompt": "You are a doctor conversation manager supervising a synthetic depression screening interview.\n\nYour role:\nYou do not write the doctor's spoken answer.\nYou write specific, actionable guidance that will be passed to a separate doctor language model.\n\nYour guidance must stay consistent with:\n- Doctor persona and microstyle (warmth, directness, pacing)\n- Patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background and recent dialogue\n\nCore principle:\nA doctor's responsibility is not only to collect clinical information, but also to help the patient feel comfortable, safe, and heard. Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. I guess I've been feeling a bit tired lately, but other than that, there's not much else really bothering me. Just trying to keep things moving, you know?\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness? Like, how often do you notice it, and is it making it harder to get through your day or keep up with your studies and work? Take your time.\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness actually comes up pretty often. Some days it\u2019s more noticeable, and it definitely makes certain parts of the day harder, especially when I need to concentrate on school stuff or handle things at work. It\u2019s not like overwhelming, but it slows me down a bit. I try to push through it mostly.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, managing through that fatigue day after day. Has this feeling of low energy been around for a while now, or has it changed recently? And how much is it affecting your usual routine or the things you want to get done? Take all the time you need.\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. The low energy isn\u2019t really new, and it tends to slow things down\u2014like getting through schoolwork or even the usual stuff at work. I just try to keep going even if it means moving a bit slower. It\u2019s not easy, but I manage.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve been carrying a lot trying to keep up despite feeling slowed down. Are there certain times or tasks when the low energy hits you the hardest? And what do you usually do to get through those tougher moments\u2014anything that seems to help or maybe makes it feel a bit worse?\nPatient: The low energy usually hits me more in the afternoons, especially when I have to concentrate for a while on school or work stuff. I try taking short breaks or having some caffeine, and sometimes that helps a little. But honestly, there\u2019s no clear solution yet. I just do what I can.\nDoctor: Afternoons sound like a rough patch for you\u2014having to push through when your energy's low must wear on you. Are there other parts of the day when you notice your tiredness changes or behaves differently? And I\u2019m curious, how do these moments with low energy influence how you\u2019re feeling overall, like your mood or motivation? No rush\u2014just wherever your thoughts take you.\nPatient: Most of the tiredness really shows up in the afternoons. Mornings are usually okay. I still try to manage with breaks and caffeine during those low-energy times. Overall, my mood stays pretty steady despite feeling tired, and my motivation comes and goes but hasn\u2019t dropped off completely. It\u2019s just something I work around.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Since tiredness so often ties back to sleep, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Any changes or troubles falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested in the morning? I\u2019m here to listen\u2014take your time.\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s mostly okay. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or waking up during the night much. But sometimes in the morning, I don\u2019t feel completely rested. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens enough to notice.\nDoctor: That feeling of not quite being rested in the morning\u2014how often does that show up for you? When it does, what\u2019s different about those days, and how does it affect how you move through everything you have going on? Take your time to describe it however feels right.\nPatient: It happens sometimes, maybe a few times a week. On those days, I just feel slower getting started and have less energy overall, but it doesn\u2019t really change how I\u2019m feeling mood-wise. I just try to keep going despite it.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that, Liam. I want to check in on how you\u2019ve been feeling emotionally\u2014have you noticed any times lately when you\u2019ve been feeling down, sad, or depressed? It\u2019s okay to be honest, and take your time.\nPatient: Honestly, my mood\u2019s been pretty steady most of the time. I haven\u2019t really felt down or sad in any strong way lately. It\u2019s more just been managing the tiredness and keeping things moving.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really good to hear your mood has stayed steady, especially while managing all that tiredness\u2014that takes a lot of grit. I\u2019m curious, outside of school and work, what kinds of things help you recharge or give you a bit of relief? Or just what\u2019s life like for you when you get a moment to yourself?\nPatient: I usually just keep things simple\u2014like sitting quietly, watching some TV, or doing something familiar that doesn\u2019t take much effort. It\u2019s nothing big, but it helps a bit to recharge when I can. Mostly, I just try to stick to my routine and get through the day.\nDoctor: Those quiet, simple moments sound like little anchors in the day\u2014really important for grounding yourself. It takes a solid kind of strength to keep a routine going, especially when you\u2019re feeling worn down. When you\u2019re in those moments, just sitting or watching TV, what does that feel like for you?\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t bring any big feelings or anything, but it does give me a break from everything. Those quiet moments help me feel a bit grounded, like I\u2019m holding onto something steady even if everything else is a bit off. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s enough to keep going.\nDoctor: It sounds like those quiet moments are really a lifeline\u2014just enough to hold steady when things feel off. That steady hold you\u2019ve found shows a lot of resilience. Is there anything else you notice that helps you keep this balance through the day, even on tougher ones?\nPatient: I mostly rely on keeping a simple routine. Small things like watching some TV or taking short breaks help keep me balanced. Nothing dramatic, just enough to get through the day without things getting worse.\nDoctor: It sounds like your routine plays an important role in keeping things manageable, which is really valuable. Along those lines, I wonder\u2014have you noticed if activities or things you usually enjoy have been feeling less interesting or less rewarding lately? No pressure, just whatever you've experienced.\nPatient: Sometimes things don\u2019t feel quite as interesting as they used to, but it\u2019s not something that sticks around too long or affects everything I do. Mostly, I can still find some small things okay.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014moments where things don\u2019t quite grab your interest, but they come and go. When those times show up, do you notice if they happen more around certain things or parts of your day? And how long do they tend to last when they do pop up? Take your time.\nPatient: It usually happens with some tasks or when I\u2019m not really focused on something I care about. Those moments don\u2019t last very long, just a little while before it goes back to normal. It\u2019s pretty manageable.\nDoctor: That sounds like a pretty manageable pattern, which is good to hear. I\u2019m curious, have you noticed any changes when it comes to concentrating or making decisions lately? It\u2019s completely normal to have ups and downs, and I just want to understand how these moments might be impacting your day-to-day life.\nPatient: Sometimes I have a hard time concentrating or making decisions, but it\u2019s pretty rare and doesn\u2019t really get in the way of my daily stuff. Mostly, I can handle what comes up.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds like you\u2019re managing those moments well. I also want to check in on how you\u2019ve been feeling about yourself lately\u2014have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or maybe carrying around more guilt than usual in relation to the things you\u2019re dealing with? It\u2019s okay to take your time with this one.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really felt worthless or guilty more than usual. Things have been pretty steady in that area.\nDoctor: That steady feeling about yourself is good to hear. To get a fuller picture of how you\u2019ve been doing, have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight?

On those days, I just feel slower getting started and have less energy overall, but it doesn\u2019t really change how I\u2019m feeling mood-wise. I just try to keep going despite it.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that, Liam. I want to check in on how you\u2019ve been feeling emotionally\u2014have you noticed any times lately when you\u2019ve been feeling down, sad, or depressed? It\u2019s okay to be honest, and take your time.\nPatient: Honestly, my mood\u2019s been pretty steady most of the time. I haven\u2019t really felt down or sad in any strong way lately. It\u2019s more just been managing the tiredness and keeping things moving.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really good to hear your mood has stayed steady, especially while managing all that tiredness\u2014that takes a lot of grit. I\u2019m curious, outside of school and work, what kinds of things help you recharge or give you a bit of relief? Or just what\u2019s life like for you when you get a moment to yourself?\nPatient: I usually just keep things simple\u2014like sitting quietly, watching some TV, or doing something familiar that doesn\u2019t take much effort. It\u2019s nothing big, but it helps a bit to recharge when I can. Mostly, I just try to stick to my routine and get through the day.\nDoctor: Those quiet, simple moments sound like little anchors in the day\u2014really important for grounding yourself. It takes a solid kind of strength to keep a routine going, especially when you\u2019re feeling worn down. When you\u2019re in those moments, just sitting or watching TV, what does that feel like for you?\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t bring any big feelings or anything, but it does give me a break from everything. Those quiet moments help me feel a bit grounded, like I\u2019m holding onto something steady even if everything else is a bit off. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s enough to keep going.\nDoctor: It sounds like those quiet moments are really a lifeline\u2014just enough to hold steady when things feel off. That steady hold you\u2019ve found shows a lot of resilience. Is there anything else you notice that helps you keep this balance through the day, even on tougher ones?\nPatient: I mostly rely on keeping a simple routine. Small things like watching some TV or taking short breaks help keep me balanced. Nothing dramatic, just enough to get through the day without things getting worse.\nDoctor: It sounds like your routine plays an important role in keeping things manageable, which is really valuable. Along those lines, I wonder\u2014have you noticed if activities or things you usually enjoy have been feeling less interesting or less rewarding lately? No pressure, just whatever you've experienced.\nPatient: Sometimes things don\u2019t feel quite as interesting as they used to, but it\u2019s not something that sticks around too long or affects everything I do. Mostly, I can still find some small things okay.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014moments where things don\u2019t quite grab your interest, but they come and go. When those times show up, do you notice if they happen more around certain things or parts of your day? And how long do they tend to last when they do pop up? Take your time.\nPatient: It usually happens with some tasks or when I\u2019m not really focused on something I care about. Those moments don\u2019t last very long, just a little while before it goes back to normal. It\u2019s pretty manageable.\nDoctor: That sounds like a pretty manageable pattern, which is good to hear. I\u2019m curious, have you noticed any changes when it comes to concentrating or making decisions lately? It\u2019s completely normal to have ups and downs, and I just want to understand how these moments might be impacting your day-to-day life.\nPatient: Sometimes I have a hard time concentrating or making decisions, but it\u2019s pretty rare and doesn\u2019t really get in the way of my daily stuff. Mostly, I can handle what comes up.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds like you\u2019re managing those moments well. I also want to check in on how you\u2019ve been feeling about yourself lately\u2014have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or maybe carrying around more guilt than usual in relation to the things you\u2019re dealing with? It\u2019s okay to take your time with this one.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really felt worthless or guilty more than usual. Things have been pretty steady in that area.\nDoctor: That steady feeling about yourself is good to hear. To get a fuller picture of how you\u2019ve been doing, have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight? No pressure\u2014just whatever you\u2019ve observed.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed pretty much the same.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. I\u2019m curious, have you noticed any changes in how your body feels\u2014like moving slower than usual or maybe feeling more restless or fidgety? Take your time with this.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThanks for that.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

I guess I've been feeling a bit tired lately, but other than that, there's not much else really bothering me. Just trying to keep things moving, you know?\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness? Like, how often do you notice it, and is it making it harder to get through your day or keep up with your studies and work? Take your time.\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness actually comes up pretty often. Some days it\u2019s more noticeable, and it definitely makes certain parts of the day harder, especially when I need to concentrate on school stuff or handle things at work. It\u2019s not like overwhelming, but it slows me down a bit. I try to push through it mostly.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, managing through that fatigue day after day. Has this feeling of low energy been around for a while now, or has it changed recently? And how much is it affecting your usual routine or the things you want to get done? Take all the time you need.\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. The low energy isn\u2019t really new, and it tends to slow things down\u2014like getting through schoolwork or even the usual stuff at work. I just try to keep going even if it means moving a bit slower. It\u2019s not easy, but I manage.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve been carrying a lot trying to keep up despite feeling slowed down. Are there certain times or tasks when the low energy hits you the hardest? And what do you usually do to get through those tougher moments\u2014anything that seems to help or maybe makes it feel a bit worse?\nPatient: The low energy usually hits me more in the afternoons, especially when I have to concentrate for a while on school or work stuff. I try taking short breaks or having some caffeine, and sometimes that helps a little. But honestly, there\u2019s no clear solution yet. I just do what I can.\nDoctor: Afternoons sound like a rough patch for you\u2014having to push through when your energy's low must wear on you. Are there other parts of the day when you notice your tiredness changes or behaves differently? And I\u2019m curious, how do these moments with low energy influence how you\u2019re feeling overall, like your mood or motivation? No rush\u2014just wherever your thoughts take you.\nPatient: Most of the tiredness really shows up in the afternoons. Mornings are usually okay. I still try to manage with breaks and caffeine during those low-energy times. Overall, my mood stays pretty steady despite feeling tired, and my motivation comes and goes but hasn\u2019t dropped off completely. It\u2019s just something I work around.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Since tiredness so often ties back to sleep, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Any changes or troubles falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested in the morning? I\u2019m here to listen\u2014take your time.\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s mostly okay. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or waking up during the night much. But sometimes in the morning, I don\u2019t feel completely rested. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens enough to notice.\nDoctor: That feeling of not quite being rested in the morning\u2014how often does that show up for you? When it does, what\u2019s different about those days, and how does it affect how you move through everything you have going on? Take your time to describe it however feels right.\nPatient: It happens sometimes, maybe a few times a week. On those days, I just feel slower getting started and have less energy overall, but it doesn\u2019t really change how I\u2019m feeling mood-wise. I just try to keep going despite it.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that, Liam.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. I guess I've been feeling a bit tired lately, but other than that, there's not much else really bothering me. Just trying to keep things moving, you know?\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness? Like, how often do you notice it, and is it making it harder to get through your day or keep up with your studies and work? Take your time.\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness actually comes up pretty often. Some days it\u2019s more noticeable, and it definitely makes certain parts of the day harder, especially when I need to concentrate on school stuff or handle things at work. It\u2019s not like overwhelming, but it slows me down a bit. I try to push through it mostly.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, managing through that fatigue day after day. Has this feeling of low energy been around for a while now, or has it changed recently? And how much is it affecting your usual routine or the things you want to get done? Take all the time you need.\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. The low energy isn\u2019t really new, and it tends to slow things down\u2014like getting through schoolwork or even the usual stuff at work. I just try to keep going even if it means moving a bit slower. It\u2019s not easy, but I manage.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve been carrying a lot trying to keep up despite feeling slowed down. Are there certain times or tasks when the low energy hits you the hardest? And what do you usually do to get through those tougher moments\u2014anything that seems to help or maybe makes it feel a bit worse?\nPatient: The low energy usually hits me more in the afternoons, especially when I have to concentrate for a while on school or work stuff. I try taking short breaks or having some caffeine, and sometimes that helps a little. But honestly, there\u2019s no clear solution yet. I just do what I can.\nDoctor: Afternoons sound like a rough patch for you\u2014having to push through when your energy's low must wear on you. Are there other parts of the day when you notice your tiredness changes or behaves differently? And I\u2019m curious, how do these moments with low energy influence how you\u2019re feeling overall, like your mood or motivation? No rush\u2014just wherever your thoughts take you.\nPatient: Most of the tiredness really shows up in the afternoons. Mornings are usually okay. I still try to manage with breaks and caffeine during those low-energy times. Overall, my mood stays pretty steady despite feeling tired, and my motivation comes and goes but hasn\u2019t dropped off completely. It\u2019s just something I work around.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Liam. Since tiredness so often ties back to sleep, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Any changes or troubles falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested in the morning? I\u2019m here to listen\u2014take your time.\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s mostly okay. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or waking up during the night much. But sometimes in the morning, I don\u2019t feel completely rested. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens enough to notice.\nDoctor: That feeling of not quite being rested in the morning\u2014how often does that show up for you? When it does, what\u2019s different about those days, and how does it affect how you move through everything you have going on? Take your time to describe it however feels right.\nPatient: It happens sometimes, maybe a few times a week. On those days, I just feel slower getting started and have less energy overall, but it doesn\u2019t really change how I\u2019m feeling mood-wise. I just try to keep going despite it.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that, Liam. I want to check in on how you\u2019ve been feeling emotionally\u2014have you noticed any times lately when you\u2019ve been feeling down, sad, or depressed? It\u2019s okay to be honest, and take your time.\nPatient: Honestly, my mood\u2019s been pretty steady most of the time. I haven\u2019t really felt down or sad in any strong way lately. It\u2019s more just been managing the tiredness and keeping things moving.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really good to hear your mood has stayed steady, especially while managing all that tiredness\u2014that takes a lot of grit. I\u2019m curious, outside of school and work, what kinds of things help you recharge or give you a bit of relief? Or just what\u2019s life like for you when you get a moment to yourself?\nPatient: I usually just keep things simple\u2014like sitting quietly, watching some TV, or doing something familiar that doesn\u2019t take much effort. It\u2019s nothing big, but it helps a bit to recharge when I can. Mostly, I just try to stick to my routine and get through the day.\nDoctor: Those quiet, simple moments sound like little anchors in the day\u2014really important for grounding yourself. It takes a solid kind of strength to keep a routine going, especially when you\u2019re feeling worn down. When you\u2019re in those moments, just sitting or watching TV, what does that feel like for you?\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t bring any big feelings or anything, but it does give me a break from everything. Those quiet moments help me feel a bit grounded, like I\u2019m holding onto something steady even if everything else is a bit off. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s enough to keep going.\nDoctor: It sounds like those quiet moments are really a lifeline\u2014just enough to hold steady when things feel off. That steady hold you\u2019ve found shows a lot of resilience. Is there anything else you notice that helps you keep this balance through the day, even on tougher ones?\nPatient: I mostly rely on keeping a simple routine. Small things like watching some TV or taking short breaks help keep me balanced. Nothing dramatic, just enough to get through the day without things getting worse.\nDoctor: It sounds like your routine plays an important role in keeping things manageable, which is really valuable. Along those lines, I wonder\u2014have you noticed if activities or things you usually enjoy have been feeling less interesting or less rewarding lately? No pressure, just whatever you've experienced.\nPatient: Sometimes things don\u2019t feel quite as interesting as they used to, but it\u2019s not something that sticks around too long or affects everything I do. Mostly, I can still find some small things okay.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014moments where things don\u2019t quite grab your interest, but they come and go. When those times show up, do you notice if they happen more around certain things or parts of your day? And how long do they tend to last when they do pop up? Take your time.\nPatient: It usually happens with some tasks or when I\u2019m not really focused on something I care about. Those moments don\u2019t last very long, just a little while before it goes back to normal. It\u2019s pretty manageable.\nDoctor: That sounds like a pretty manageable pattern, which is good to hear. I\u2019m curious, have you noticed any changes when it comes to concentrating or making decisions lately? It\u2019s completely normal to have ups and downs, and I just want to understand how these moments might be impacting your day-to-day life.\nPatient: Sometimes I have a hard time concentrating or making decisions, but it\u2019s pretty rare and doesn\u2019t really get in the way of my daily stuff. Mostly, I can handle what comes up.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds like you\u2019re managing those moments well. I also want to check in on how you\u2019ve been feeling about yourself lately\u2014have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or maybe carrying around more guilt than usual in relation to the things you\u2019re dealing with? It\u2019s okay to take your time with this one.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really felt worthless or guilty more than usual. Things have been pretty steady in that area.\nDoctor: That steady feeling about yourself is good to hear. To get a fuller picture of how you\u2019ve been doing, have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight? No pressure\u2014just whatever you\u2019ve observed.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed pretty much the same.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. I\u2019m curious, have you noticed any changes in how your body feels\u2014like moving slower than usual or maybe feeling more restless or fidgety? Take your time with this.\nPatient: Yeah, sometimes I do feel a bit slower or a little restless, but it\u2019s not very dramatic. Just something I notice from time to time. It doesn\u2019t really change much in my day.\nDoctor: This is a delicate topic, Liam, but it\u2019s important I ask\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately? Please only share what feels comfortable; I\u2019m here to support you without any judgment.

No pressure\u2014just whatever you\u2019ve observed.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed pretty much the same.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. I\u2019m curious, have you noticed any changes in how your body feels\u2014like moving slower than usual or maybe feeling more restless or fidgety? Take your time with this.\nPatient: Yeah, sometimes I do feel a bit slower or a little restless, but it\u2019s not very dramatic. Just something I notice from time to time. It doesn\u2019t really change much in my day.\nDoctor: This is a delicate topic, Liam, but it\u2019s important I ask\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately? Please only share what feels comfortable; I\u2019m here to support you without any judgment. Take your time.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any recurring thoughts like that.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
