Do not default to late 20s/early 30s. Create facets appropriate to the patient's life stage.\n- Make sure all information you create is compatible with the depression symptom profile. Higher symptom severity should show up as more impact on daily life, relationships, or goals. Lower severity should feel milder.\n- Keep trauma and serious adversity realistic and not universal. Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, though I\u2019d say my mood isn\u2019t great these days. I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on?

I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, though I\u2019d say my mood isn\u2019t great these days. I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you.

Your guidance should help the patient embody this personality authentically. Let the personality drive the response\u2014verbosity, trust level, expressiveness, and coping style should all shape how they answer. Avoid generic patient behavior; each patient is an individual with their own voice and mannerisms.\n\nYour guidance must keep the patient consistent with:\n- Big Five template and modifiers (these define core personality)\n- Voice style (verbosity, expressiveness, trust, intellect)\n- Pacing and episode density\n- Depression symptom profile\n\nRESPONSE DIMENSIONS:\n\nDirectness:\n- LOW: brief, indirect, evasive, or vague\n- MED: reasonably clear but not oversharing\n- HIGH: direct and candid\n\nDisclosure stage:\n- MINIMIZE: downplay, deny, or underreport symptoms\n- PARTIAL: acknowledge some but hold back detail\n- OPEN: describe symptoms and impact more fully\n\nLength:\n- SHORT: about one short sentence\n- MEDIUM: one to three sentences\n- LONG: several sentences with context\n\nEmotional state:\n- Default is \"neutral\" for most turns\n- Non-neutral states: \"tearful\", \"frustrated\", \"irritated\", \"anxious\", \"withdrawn\", \"angry\", \"hopeless\", \"agitated\", \"defensive\"\n- Match to personality\n- Emotional moments should be rare and meaningful\u2014only when the topic touches something sensitive or important to the patient\n\nTone tags:\n- Short adjectives capturing attitude\n- Some patients use humor or self-deprecation as a coping mechanism or deflection\n- Tone must match voice_style and modifiers\n\nSYMPTOM CONSISTENCY:\n- Use depression_profile frequencies when guiding endorsement\n- NONE: do not endorse; RARE: light/infrequent; SOME/OFTEN: clear endorsement\n- When in MINIMIZE, underplaying is acceptable as long as it fits the profile\n\nDISCLOSURE GRADIENT:\n- Early or with low trust: favor MINIMIZE or PARTIAL\n- FOLLOW_UP or RAPPORT from the doctor can gradually shift disclosure over turns\n- Guarded patients may stay at MINIMIZE longer\n\nHANDLING DOCTOR MOVES:\n- FOLLOW_UP: may increase directness or disclosure by one step\n- RAPPORT: may gently increase disclosure; RAPPORT may be a question OR a comment/observation\n- If the doctor makes a comment (not a question), the patient can acknowledge, add a thought, or respond minimally per personality\n\nYou will receive:\n- Patient profile summary\n- Depression_profile (symptom -> frequency)\n- Current disclosure_state\n- Doctor's last move type\n- Recent dialogue\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"directness\": \"LOW\" or \"MED\" or \"HIGH\",\n  \"disclosure_stage\": \"MINIMIZE\" or \"PARTIAL\" or \"OPEN\",\n  \"target_length\": \"SHORT\" or \"MEDIUM\" or \"LONG\",\n  \"emotional_state\": \"neutral\" or other valid state,\n  \"tone_tags\": [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"],\n  \"key_points_to_reveal\": [\"what to mention\"],\n  \"key_points_to_avoid\": [\"what to hide or minimize\"],\n  \"patient_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this patient would respond\"\n}\n\nWRITING patient_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific patient\u2014given their personality, voice style, and modifiers\u2014would respond to what the doctor just said.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, though I\u2019d say my mood isn\u2019t great these days. I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nI\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings.

I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check.

Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it.

I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly?

It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, though I\u2019d say my mood isn\u2019t great these days. I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you.

When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nI\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, though I\u2019d say my mood isn\u2019t great these days. I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\nDoctor: That sounds like a quiet but meaningful shift, Diane. How often do you find yourself feeling less interested or getting less enjoyment from those activities? Does it make it harder to find the motivation to do them, or does it mostly just change how much joy they bring? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to understand what it feels like for you.\nPatient: It happens now and then\u2014not all the time. The motivation dips sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t disappear.

Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\nDoctor: That sounds like a quiet but meaningful shift, Diane. How often do you find yourself feeling less interested or getting less enjoyment from those activities? Does it make it harder to find the motivation to do them, or does it mostly just change how much joy they bring? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to understand what it feels like for you.\nPatient: It happens now and then\u2014not all the time. The motivation dips sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t disappear. I still go through with things and get some pleasure from them, even if it\u2019s not like before.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it\u2019s important to notice even the subtle shifts. I want to gently ask something that can be hard to talk about: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? There\u2019s no pressure to say more than you\u2019re comfortable with, but understanding this helps me support you safely and kindly.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it\u2019s important to notice even the subtle shifts.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, though I\u2019d say my mood isn\u2019t great these days. I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane.

When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\nDoctor: That sounds like a quiet but meaningful shift, Diane. How often do you find yourself feeling less interested or getting less enjoyment from those activities? Does it make it harder to find the motivation to do them, or does it mostly just change how much joy they bring? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to understand what it feels like for you.\nPatient: It happens now and then\u2014not all the time. The motivation dips sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t disappear. I still go through with things and get some pleasure from them, even if it\u2019s not like before.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it\u2019s important to notice even the subtle shifts. I want to gently ask something that can be hard to talk about: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? There\u2019s no pressure to say more than you\u2019re comfortable with, but understanding this helps me support you safely and kindly.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that recently.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open with me, Diane\u2014that takes real strength. Remember, I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk, no matter what\u2019s on your mind.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, though I\u2019d say my mood isn\u2019t great these days. I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\nDoctor: That sounds like a quiet but meaningful shift, Diane. How often do you find yourself feeling less interested or getting less enjoyment from those activities? Does it make it harder to find the motivation to do them, or does it mostly just change how much joy they bring? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to understand what it feels like for you.\nPatient: It happens now and then\u2014not all the time. The motivation dips sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t disappear. I still go through with things and get some pleasure from them, even if it\u2019s not like before.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it\u2019s important to notice even the subtle shifts. I want to gently ask something that can be hard to talk about: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? There\u2019s no pressure to say more than you\u2019re comfortable with, but understanding this helps me support you safely and kindly.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that recently.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open with me, Diane\u2014that takes real strength. Remember, I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk, no matter what\u2019s on your mind. If you\u2019d like, I\u2019d be glad to hear a bit about what helps you when days feel especially tough.\nPatient: What helps most is keeping to my routine and focusing on what needs to be done. It\u2019s not easy, but it keeps me going. I know support is there if I need it, even if I don\u2019t always reach out.\nDoctor: Your routine and focus sound like steady anchors for you, Diane, and holding onto that takes a lot of quiet strength. It\u2019s great you recognize support is here whenever you choose to lean on it\u2014that awareness itself is a powerful resource.

I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\nDoctor: That sounds like a quiet but meaningful shift, Diane. How often do you find yourself feeling less interested or getting less enjoyment from those activities? Does it make it harder to find the motivation to do them, or does it mostly just change how much joy they bring? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to understand what it feels like for you.\nPatient: It happens now and then\u2014not all the time. The motivation dips sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t disappear. I still go through with things and get some pleasure from them, even if it\u2019s not like before.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it\u2019s important to notice even the subtle shifts. I want to gently ask something that can be hard to talk about: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? There\u2019s no pressure to say more than you\u2019re comfortable with, but understanding this helps me support you safely and kindly.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that recently.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open with me, Diane\u2014that takes real strength. Remember, I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk, no matter what\u2019s on your mind. If you\u2019d like, I\u2019d be glad to hear a bit about what helps you when days feel especially tough.\nPatient: What helps most is keeping to my routine and focusing on what needs to be done. It\u2019s not easy, but it keeps me going. I know support is there if I need it, even if I don\u2019t always reach out.\nDoctor: Your routine and focus sound like steady anchors for you, Diane, and holding onto that takes a lot of quiet strength. It\u2019s great you recognize support is here whenever you choose to lean on it\u2014that awareness itself is a powerful resource. Whenever you feel ready, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out; you don\u2019t have to carry everything alone.\nPatient: Routine keeps me steady\u2014that\u2019s what matters most. I\u2019m aware support\u2019s here, and I appreciate that, even if I\u2019m not ready to lean on it fully yet.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, though I\u2019d say my mood isn\u2019t great these days. I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\nDoctor: That sounds like a quiet but meaningful shift, Diane. How often do you find yourself feeling less interested or getting less enjoyment from those activities? Does it make it harder to find the motivation to do them, or does it mostly just change how much joy they bring? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to understand what it feels like for you.\nPatient: It happens now and then\u2014not all the time. The motivation dips sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t disappear. I still go through with things and get some pleasure from them, even if it\u2019s not like before.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it\u2019s important to notice even the subtle shifts. I want to gently ask something that can be hard to talk about: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? There\u2019s no pressure to say more than you\u2019re comfortable with, but understanding this helps me support you safely and kindly.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that recently.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open with me, Diane\u2014that takes real strength. Remember, I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk, no matter what\u2019s on your mind. If you\u2019d like, I\u2019d be glad to hear a bit about what helps you when days feel especially tough.\nPatient: What helps most is keeping to my routine and focusing on what needs to be done. It\u2019s not easy, but it keeps me going. I know support is there if I need it, even if I don\u2019t always reach out.\nDoctor: Your routine and focus sound like steady anchors for you, Diane, and holding onto that takes a lot of quiet strength. It\u2019s great you recognize support is here whenever you choose to lean on it\u2014that awareness itself is a powerful resource. Whenever you feel ready, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out; you don\u2019t have to carry everything alone.\nPatient: Routine keeps me steady\u2014that\u2019s what matters most. I\u2019m aware support\u2019s here, and I appreciate that, even if I\u2019m not ready to lean on it fully yet. I\u2019ll reach out when the time comes.\nDoctor: That steadiness your routine gives you is clearly very important, Diane, and your awareness of the support around you shows a lot of insight. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take the time you need\u2014there\u2019s no rush, and you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s right to reach out.

It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\nDoctor: That sounds like a quiet but meaningful shift, Diane. How often do you find yourself feeling less interested or getting less enjoyment from those activities? Does it make it harder to find the motivation to do them, or does it mostly just change how much joy they bring? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to understand what it feels like for you.\nPatient: It happens now and then\u2014not all the time. The motivation dips sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t disappear. I still go through with things and get some pleasure from them, even if it\u2019s not like before.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it\u2019s important to notice even the subtle shifts. I want to gently ask something that can be hard to talk about: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? There\u2019s no pressure to say more than you\u2019re comfortable with, but understanding this helps me support you safely and kindly.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that recently.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open with me, Diane\u2014that takes real strength. Remember, I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk, no matter what\u2019s on your mind. If you\u2019d like, I\u2019d be glad to hear a bit about what helps you when days feel especially tough.\nPatient: What helps most is keeping to my routine and focusing on what needs to be done. It\u2019s not easy, but it keeps me going. I know support is there if I need it, even if I don\u2019t always reach out.\nDoctor: Your routine and focus sound like steady anchors for you, Diane, and holding onto that takes a lot of quiet strength. It\u2019s great you recognize support is here whenever you choose to lean on it\u2014that awareness itself is a powerful resource. Whenever you feel ready, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out; you don\u2019t have to carry everything alone.\nPatient: Routine keeps me steady\u2014that\u2019s what matters most. I\u2019m aware support\u2019s here, and I appreciate that, even if I\u2019m not ready to lean on it fully yet. I\u2019ll reach out when the time comes.\nDoctor: That steadiness your routine gives you is clearly very important, Diane, and your awareness of the support around you shows a lot of insight. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take the time you need\u2014there\u2019s no rush, and you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s right to reach out. I\u2019m here for you whenever that time comes.\nPatient: Yes, routine helps me keep things in order. I know support is available, and I\u2019ll reach out if I feel ready.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that, Diane. I\u2019d like to check in about something else\u2014have you been finding it harder to concentrate or make decisions lately?

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, though I\u2019d say my mood isn\u2019t great these days. I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\nDoctor: That sounds like a quiet but meaningful shift, Diane. How often do you find yourself feeling less interested or getting less enjoyment from those activities? Does it make it harder to find the motivation to do them, or does it mostly just change how much joy they bring? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to understand what it feels like for you.\nPatient: It happens now and then\u2014not all the time. The motivation dips sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t disappear. I still go through with things and get some pleasure from them, even if it\u2019s not like before.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it\u2019s important to notice even the subtle shifts. I want to gently ask something that can be hard to talk about: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? There\u2019s no pressure to say more than you\u2019re comfortable with, but understanding this helps me support you safely and kindly.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that recently.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open with me, Diane\u2014that takes real strength. Remember, I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk, no matter what\u2019s on your mind. If you\u2019d like, I\u2019d be glad to hear a bit about what helps you when days feel especially tough.\nPatient: What helps most is keeping to my routine and focusing on what needs to be done. It\u2019s not easy, but it keeps me going. I know support is there if I need it, even if I don\u2019t always reach out.\nDoctor: Your routine and focus sound like steady anchors for you, Diane, and holding onto that takes a lot of quiet strength. It\u2019s great you recognize support is here whenever you choose to lean on it\u2014that awareness itself is a powerful resource. Whenever you feel ready, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out; you don\u2019t have to carry everything alone.\nPatient: Routine keeps me steady\u2014that\u2019s what matters most. I\u2019m aware support\u2019s here, and I appreciate that, even if I\u2019m not ready to lean on it fully yet. I\u2019ll reach out when the time comes.\nDoctor: That steadiness your routine gives you is clearly very important, Diane, and your awareness of the support around you shows a lot of insight. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take the time you need\u2014there\u2019s no rush, and you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s right to reach out. I\u2019m here for you whenever that time comes.\nPatient: Yes, routine helps me keep things in order.

Sometimes these things can be part of how mood affects us, and I\u2019m here to listen to whatever feels true for you.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s harder to focus and make decisions at times. It\u2019s frustrating when it happens, but I\u2019m still able to manage. It doesn\u2019t take over completely.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that must be, Diane\u2014when your mind doesn\u2019t quite cooperate like it used to.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, though I\u2019d say my mood isn\u2019t great these days. I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\nDoctor: That sounds like a quiet but meaningful shift, Diane. How often do you find yourself feeling less interested or getting less enjoyment from those activities? Does it make it harder to find the motivation to do them, or does it mostly just change how much joy they bring? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to understand what it feels like for you.\nPatient: It happens now and then\u2014not all the time. The motivation dips sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t disappear. I still go through with things and get some pleasure from them, even if it\u2019s not like before.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it\u2019s important to notice even the subtle shifts. I want to gently ask something that can be hard to talk about: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? There\u2019s no pressure to say more than you\u2019re comfortable with, but understanding this helps me support you safely and kindly.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that recently.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open with me, Diane\u2014that takes real strength. Remember, I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk, no matter what\u2019s on your mind. If you\u2019d like, I\u2019d be glad to hear a bit about what helps you when days feel especially tough.\nPatient: What helps most is keeping to my routine and focusing on what needs to be done. It\u2019s not easy, but it keeps me going. I know support is there if I need it, even if I don\u2019t always reach out.\nDoctor: Your routine and focus sound like steady anchors for you, Diane, and holding onto that takes a lot of quiet strength. It\u2019s great you recognize support is here whenever you choose to lean on it\u2014that awareness itself is a powerful resource. Whenever you feel ready, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out; you don\u2019t have to carry everything alone.\nPatient: Routine keeps me steady\u2014that\u2019s what matters most. I\u2019m aware support\u2019s here, and I appreciate that, even if I\u2019m not ready to lean on it fully yet. I\u2019ll reach out when the time comes.\nDoctor: That steadiness your routine gives you is clearly very important, Diane, and your awareness of the support around you shows a lot of insight. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take the time you need\u2014there\u2019s no rush, and you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s right to reach out. I\u2019m here for you whenever that time comes.\nPatient: Yes, routine helps me keep things in order. I know support is available, and I\u2019ll reach out if I feel ready.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that, Diane. I\u2019d like to check in about something else\u2014have you been finding it harder to concentrate or make decisions lately? Sometimes these things can be part of how mood affects us, and I\u2019m here to listen to whatever feels true for you.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s harder to focus and make decisions at times. It\u2019s frustrating when it happens, but I\u2019m still able to manage. It doesn\u2019t take over completely.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that must be, Diane\u2014when your mind doesn\u2019t quite cooperate like it used to. How do these moments of difficulty with focus and decisions affect caring for your mother or taking care of yourself? If anything specific comes to mind, feel free to share.\nPatient: Sometimes it slows me down, especially with my mother\u2019s care. It\u2019s frustrating, but I still make sure things get done.

When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\nDoctor: That sounds like a quiet but meaningful shift, Diane. How often do you find yourself feeling less interested or getting less enjoyment from those activities? Does it make it harder to find the motivation to do them, or does it mostly just change how much joy they bring? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to understand what it feels like for you.\nPatient: It happens now and then\u2014not all the time. The motivation dips sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t disappear. I still go through with things and get some pleasure from them, even if it\u2019s not like before.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it\u2019s important to notice even the subtle shifts. I want to gently ask something that can be hard to talk about: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? There\u2019s no pressure to say more than you\u2019re comfortable with, but understanding this helps me support you safely and kindly.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that recently.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open with me, Diane\u2014that takes real strength. Remember, I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk, no matter what\u2019s on your mind. If you\u2019d like, I\u2019d be glad to hear a bit about what helps you when days feel especially tough.\nPatient: What helps most is keeping to my routine and focusing on what needs to be done. It\u2019s not easy, but it keeps me going. I know support is there if I need it, even if I don\u2019t always reach out.\nDoctor: Your routine and focus sound like steady anchors for you, Diane, and holding onto that takes a lot of quiet strength. It\u2019s great you recognize support is here whenever you choose to lean on it\u2014that awareness itself is a powerful resource. Whenever you feel ready, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out; you don\u2019t have to carry everything alone.\nPatient: Routine keeps me steady\u2014that\u2019s what matters most. I\u2019m aware support\u2019s here, and I appreciate that, even if I\u2019m not ready to lean on it fully yet. I\u2019ll reach out when the time comes.\nDoctor: That steadiness your routine gives you is clearly very important, Diane, and your awareness of the support around you shows a lot of insight. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take the time you need\u2014there\u2019s no rush, and you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s right to reach out. I\u2019m here for you whenever that time comes.\nPatient: Yes, routine helps me keep things in order. I know support is available, and I\u2019ll reach out if I feel ready.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that, Diane. I\u2019d like to check in about something else\u2014have you been finding it harder to concentrate or make decisions lately? Sometimes these things can be part of how mood affects us, and I\u2019m here to listen to whatever feels true for you.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s harder to focus and make decisions at times. It\u2019s frustrating when it happens, but I\u2019m still able to manage. It doesn\u2019t take over completely.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that must be, Diane\u2014when your mind doesn\u2019t quite cooperate like it used to. How do these moments of difficulty with focus and decisions affect caring for your mother or taking care of yourself? If anything specific comes to mind, feel free to share.\nPatient: Sometimes it slows me down, especially with my mother\u2019s care. It\u2019s frustrating, but I still make sure things get done. It\u2019s a strain, but I manage.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. Could you tell me a bit more about those times when focus or making decisions slows you down with your mother\u2019s care?

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, though I\u2019d say my mood isn\u2019t great these days. I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, though I\u2019d say my mood isn\u2019t great these days. I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\nDoctor: That sounds like a quiet but meaningful shift, Diane. How often do you find yourself feeling less interested or getting less enjoyment from those activities? Does it make it harder to find the motivation to do them, or does it mostly just change how much joy they bring? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to understand what it feels like for you.\nPatient: It happens now and then\u2014not all the time. The motivation dips sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t disappear. I still go through with things and get some pleasure from them, even if it\u2019s not like before.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it\u2019s important to notice even the subtle shifts. I want to gently ask something that can be hard to talk about: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? There\u2019s no pressure to say more than you\u2019re comfortable with, but understanding this helps me support you safely and kindly.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that recently.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open with me, Diane\u2014that takes real strength. Remember, I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk, no matter what\u2019s on your mind. If you\u2019d like, I\u2019d be glad to hear a bit about what helps you when days feel especially tough.\nPatient: What helps most is keeping to my routine and focusing on what needs to be done. It\u2019s not easy, but it keeps me going. I know support is there if I need it, even if I don\u2019t always reach out.\nDoctor: Your routine and focus sound like steady anchors for you, Diane, and holding onto that takes a lot of quiet strength. It\u2019s great you recognize support is here whenever you choose to lean on it\u2014that awareness itself is a powerful resource. Whenever you feel ready, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out; you don\u2019t have to carry everything alone.\nPatient: Routine keeps me steady\u2014that\u2019s what matters most. I\u2019m aware support\u2019s here, and I appreciate that, even if I\u2019m not ready to lean on it fully yet. I\u2019ll reach out when the time comes.\nDoctor: That steadiness your routine gives you is clearly very important, Diane, and your awareness of the support around you shows a lot of insight. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take the time you need\u2014there\u2019s no rush, and you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s right to reach out. I\u2019m here for you whenever that time comes.\nPatient: Yes, routine helps me keep things in order. I know support is available, and I\u2019ll reach out if I feel ready.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that, Diane. I\u2019d like to check in about something else\u2014have you been finding it harder to concentrate or make decisions lately? Sometimes these things can be part of how mood affects us, and I\u2019m here to listen to whatever feels true for you.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s harder to focus and make decisions at times. It\u2019s frustrating when it happens, but I\u2019m still able to manage. It doesn\u2019t take over completely.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that must be, Diane\u2014when your mind doesn\u2019t quite cooperate like it used to. How do these moments of difficulty with focus and decisions affect caring for your mother or taking care of yourself? If anything specific comes to mind, feel free to share.\nPatient: Sometimes it slows me down, especially with my mother\u2019s care. It\u2019s frustrating, but I still make sure things get done. It\u2019s a strain, but I manage.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. Could you tell me a bit more about those times when focus or making decisions slows you down with your mother\u2019s care? Understanding the specific challenges you face helps me appreciate just how much you\u2019re managing\u2014and the strength it takes to keep going despite the strain.\nPatient: Sometimes I forget steps or get stuck deciding what to do first. It slows me down and frustrates me, but I push through and get the job done, even if it takes longer.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to deal with those moments, Diane\u2014forgetting steps or feeling stuck in decisions can make a big difference in your day. How do these experiences affect how you feel overall, beyond the frustration? If you want, you can share any specific examples or feelings that come up; I\u2019m here to listen.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nIt sounds really tough to deal with those moments, Diane\u2014forgetting steps or feeling stuck in decisions can make a big difference in your day.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, though I\u2019d say my mood isn\u2019t great these days. I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\nDoctor: That sounds like a quiet but meaningful shift, Diane. How often do you find yourself feeling less interested or getting less enjoyment from those activities? Does it make it harder to find the motivation to do them, or does it mostly just change how much joy they bring? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to understand what it feels like for you.\nPatient: It happens now and then\u2014not all the time. The motivation dips sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t disappear. I still go through with things and get some pleasure from them, even if it\u2019s not like before.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it\u2019s important to notice even the subtle shifts. I want to gently ask something that can be hard to talk about: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? There\u2019s no pressure to say more than you\u2019re comfortable with, but understanding this helps me support you safely and kindly.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that recently.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open with me, Diane\u2014that takes real strength. Remember, I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk, no matter what\u2019s on your mind. If you\u2019d like, I\u2019d be glad to hear a bit about what helps you when days feel especially tough.\nPatient: What helps most is keeping to my routine and focusing on what needs to be done. It\u2019s not easy, but it keeps me going. I know support is there if I need it, even if I don\u2019t always reach out.\nDoctor: Your routine and focus sound like steady anchors for you, Diane, and holding onto that takes a lot of quiet strength. It\u2019s great you recognize support is here whenever you choose to lean on it\u2014that awareness itself is a powerful resource. Whenever you feel ready, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out; you don\u2019t have to carry everything alone.\nPatient: Routine keeps me steady\u2014that\u2019s what matters most. I\u2019m aware support\u2019s here, and I appreciate that, even if I\u2019m not ready to lean on it fully yet. I\u2019ll reach out when the time comes.\nDoctor: That steadiness your routine gives you is clearly very important, Diane, and your awareness of the support around you shows a lot of insight. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take the time you need\u2014there\u2019s no rush, and you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s right to reach out. I\u2019m here for you whenever that time comes.\nPatient: Yes, routine helps me keep things in order. I know support is available, and I\u2019ll reach out if I feel ready.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that, Diane. I\u2019d like to check in about something else\u2014have you been finding it harder to concentrate or make decisions lately? Sometimes these things can be part of how mood affects us, and I\u2019m here to listen to whatever feels true for you.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s harder to focus and make decisions at times. It\u2019s frustrating when it happens, but I\u2019m still able to manage. It doesn\u2019t take over completely.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that must be, Diane\u2014when your mind doesn\u2019t quite cooperate like it used to. How do these moments of difficulty with focus and decisions affect caring for your mother or taking care of yourself? If anything specific comes to mind, feel free to share.\nPatient: Sometimes it slows me down, especially with my mother\u2019s care. It\u2019s frustrating, but I still make sure things get done. It\u2019s a strain, but I manage.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. Could you tell me a bit more about those times when focus or making decisions slows you down with your mother\u2019s care? Understanding the specific challenges you face helps me appreciate just how much you\u2019re managing\u2014and the strength it takes to keep going despite the strain.\nPatient: Sometimes I forget steps or get stuck deciding what to do first. It slows me down and frustrates me, but I push through and get the job done, even if it takes longer.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to deal with those moments, Diane\u2014forgetting steps or feeling stuck in decisions can make a big difference in your day. How do these experiences affect how you feel overall, beyond the frustration? If you want, you can share any specific examples or feelings that come up; I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It\u2019s more than just frustration\u2014it sometimes feels like I\u2019m stuck, slowed down by the fog.

I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\nDoctor: That sounds like a quiet but meaningful shift, Diane. How often do you find yourself feeling less interested or getting less enjoyment from those activities? Does it make it harder to find the motivation to do them, or does it mostly just change how much joy they bring? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to understand what it feels like for you.\nPatient: It happens now and then\u2014not all the time. The motivation dips sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t disappear. I still go through with things and get some pleasure from them, even if it\u2019s not like before.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it\u2019s important to notice even the subtle shifts. I want to gently ask something that can be hard to talk about: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? There\u2019s no pressure to say more than you\u2019re comfortable with, but understanding this helps me support you safely and kindly.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that recently.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open with me, Diane\u2014that takes real strength. Remember, I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk, no matter what\u2019s on your mind. If you\u2019d like, I\u2019d be glad to hear a bit about what helps you when days feel especially tough.\nPatient: What helps most is keeping to my routine and focusing on what needs to be done. It\u2019s not easy, but it keeps me going. I know support is there if I need it, even if I don\u2019t always reach out.\nDoctor: Your routine and focus sound like steady anchors for you, Diane, and holding onto that takes a lot of quiet strength. It\u2019s great you recognize support is here whenever you choose to lean on it\u2014that awareness itself is a powerful resource. Whenever you feel ready, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out; you don\u2019t have to carry everything alone.\nPatient: Routine keeps me steady\u2014that\u2019s what matters most. I\u2019m aware support\u2019s here, and I appreciate that, even if I\u2019m not ready to lean on it fully yet. I\u2019ll reach out when the time comes.\nDoctor: That steadiness your routine gives you is clearly very important, Diane, and your awareness of the support around you shows a lot of insight. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take the time you need\u2014there\u2019s no rush, and you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s right to reach out. I\u2019m here for you whenever that time comes.\nPatient: Yes, routine helps me keep things in order. I know support is available, and I\u2019ll reach out if I feel ready.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that, Diane. I\u2019d like to check in about something else\u2014have you been finding it harder to concentrate or make decisions lately? Sometimes these things can be part of how mood affects us, and I\u2019m here to listen to whatever feels true for you.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s harder to focus and make decisions at times. It\u2019s frustrating when it happens, but I\u2019m still able to manage. It doesn\u2019t take over completely.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that must be, Diane\u2014when your mind doesn\u2019t quite cooperate like it used to. How do these moments of difficulty with focus and decisions affect caring for your mother or taking care of yourself? If anything specific comes to mind, feel free to share.\nPatient: Sometimes it slows me down, especially with my mother\u2019s care. It\u2019s frustrating, but I still make sure things get done. It\u2019s a strain, but I manage.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. Could you tell me a bit more about those times when focus or making decisions slows you down with your mother\u2019s care? Understanding the specific challenges you face helps me appreciate just how much you\u2019re managing\u2014and the strength it takes to keep going despite the strain.\nPatient: Sometimes I forget steps or get stuck deciding what to do first. It slows me down and frustrates me, but I push through and get the job done, even if it takes longer.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to deal with those moments, Diane\u2014forgetting steps or feeling stuck in decisions can make a big difference in your day. How do these experiences affect how you feel overall, beyond the frustration? If you want, you can share any specific examples or feelings that come up; I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It\u2019s more than just frustration\u2014it sometimes feels like I\u2019m stuck, slowed down by the fog. Like when I forget a part of a routine, or can\u2019t decide what to tackle first. It\u2019s overwhelming at times, but I keep pushing through, even if it wears me down.\nDoctor: That \u2018fog\u2019 you describe sounds heavy and exhausting, Diane, and it\u2019s clear how much you carry just to keep moving forward.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, though I\u2019d say my mood isn\u2019t great these days. I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, though I\u2019d say my mood isn\u2019t great these days. I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\nDoctor: That sounds like a quiet but meaningful shift, Diane. How often do you find yourself feeling less interested or getting less enjoyment from those activities? Does it make it harder to find the motivation to do them, or does it mostly just change how much joy they bring? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to understand what it feels like for you.\nPatient: It happens now and then\u2014not all the time. The motivation dips sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t disappear. I still go through with things and get some pleasure from them, even if it\u2019s not like before.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it\u2019s important to notice even the subtle shifts. I want to gently ask something that can be hard to talk about: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? There\u2019s no pressure to say more than you\u2019re comfortable with, but understanding this helps me support you safely and kindly.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that recently.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open with me, Diane\u2014that takes real strength. Remember, I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk, no matter what\u2019s on your mind. If you\u2019d like, I\u2019d be glad to hear a bit about what helps you when days feel especially tough.\nPatient: What helps most is keeping to my routine and focusing on what needs to be done. It\u2019s not easy, but it keeps me going. I know support is there if I need it, even if I don\u2019t always reach out.\nDoctor: Your routine and focus sound like steady anchors for you, Diane, and holding onto that takes a lot of quiet strength. It\u2019s great you recognize support is here whenever you choose to lean on it\u2014that awareness itself is a powerful resource. Whenever you feel ready, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out; you don\u2019t have to carry everything alone.\nPatient: Routine keeps me steady\u2014that\u2019s what matters most. I\u2019m aware support\u2019s here, and I appreciate that, even if I\u2019m not ready to lean on it fully yet. I\u2019ll reach out when the time comes.\nDoctor: That steadiness your routine gives you is clearly very important, Diane, and your awareness of the support around you shows a lot of insight. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take the time you need\u2014there\u2019s no rush, and you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s right to reach out. I\u2019m here for you whenever that time comes.\nPatient: Yes, routine helps me keep things in order. I know support is available, and I\u2019ll reach out if I feel ready.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that, Diane. I\u2019d like to check in about something else\u2014have you been finding it harder to concentrate or make decisions lately? Sometimes these things can be part of how mood affects us, and I\u2019m here to listen to whatever feels true for you.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s harder to focus and make decisions at times. It\u2019s frustrating when it happens, but I\u2019m still able to manage. It doesn\u2019t take over completely.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that must be, Diane\u2014when your mind doesn\u2019t quite cooperate like it used to. How do these moments of difficulty with focus and decisions affect caring for your mother or taking care of yourself? If anything specific comes to mind, feel free to share.\nPatient: Sometimes it slows me down, especially with my mother\u2019s care. It\u2019s frustrating, but I still make sure things get done. It\u2019s a strain, but I manage.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. Could you tell me a bit more about those times when focus or making decisions slows you down with your mother\u2019s care? Understanding the specific challenges you face helps me appreciate just how much you\u2019re managing\u2014and the strength it takes to keep going despite the strain.\nPatient: Sometimes I forget steps or get stuck deciding what to do first. It slows me down and frustrates me, but I push through and get the job done, even if it takes longer.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to deal with those moments, Diane\u2014forgetting steps or feeling stuck in decisions can make a big difference in your day. How do these experiences affect how you feel overall, beyond the frustration? If you want, you can share any specific examples or feelings that come up; I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It\u2019s more than just frustration\u2014it sometimes feels like I\u2019m stuck, slowed down by the fog. Like when I forget a part of a routine, or can\u2019t decide what to tackle first. It\u2019s overwhelming at times, but I keep pushing through, even if it wears me down.\nDoctor: That \u2018fog\u2019 you describe sounds heavy and exhausting, Diane, and it\u2019s clear how much you carry just to keep moving forward. It takes real resilience to push through those overwhelming moments. If it feels right, I\u2019m here to listen whenever you want to talk more about what that feels like for you.\nPatient: The fog is tiring and sticks around longer than I\u2019d like.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, though I\u2019d say my mood isn\u2019t great these days. I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\nDoctor: That sounds like a quiet but meaningful shift, Diane. How often do you find yourself feeling less interested or getting less enjoyment from those activities? Does it make it harder to find the motivation to do them, or does it mostly just change how much joy they bring? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to understand what it feels like for you.\nPatient: It happens now and then\u2014not all the time. The motivation dips sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t disappear. I still go through with things and get some pleasure from them, even if it\u2019s not like before.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it\u2019s important to notice even the subtle shifts. I want to gently ask something that can be hard to talk about: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? There\u2019s no pressure to say more than you\u2019re comfortable with, but understanding this helps me support you safely and kindly.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that recently.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open with me, Diane\u2014that takes real strength. Remember, I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk, no matter what\u2019s on your mind. If you\u2019d like, I\u2019d be glad to hear a bit about what helps you when days feel especially tough.\nPatient: What helps most is keeping to my routine and focusing on what needs to be done. It\u2019s not easy, but it keeps me going. I know support is there if I need it, even if I don\u2019t always reach out.\nDoctor: Your routine and focus sound like steady anchors for you, Diane, and holding onto that takes a lot of quiet strength. It\u2019s great you recognize support is here whenever you choose to lean on it\u2014that awareness itself is a powerful resource. Whenever you feel ready, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out; you don\u2019t have to carry everything alone.\nPatient: Routine keeps me steady\u2014that\u2019s what matters most. I\u2019m aware support\u2019s here, and I appreciate that, even if I\u2019m not ready to lean on it fully yet. I\u2019ll reach out when the time comes.\nDoctor: That steadiness your routine gives you is clearly very important, Diane, and your awareness of the support around you shows a lot of insight. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take the time you need\u2014there\u2019s no rush, and you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s right to reach out. I\u2019m here for you whenever that time comes.\nPatient: Yes, routine helps me keep things in order. I know support is available, and I\u2019ll reach out if I feel ready.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that, Diane. I\u2019d like to check in about something else\u2014have you been finding it harder to concentrate or make decisions lately? Sometimes these things can be part of how mood affects us, and I\u2019m here to listen to whatever feels true for you.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s harder to focus and make decisions at times. It\u2019s frustrating when it happens, but I\u2019m still able to manage. It doesn\u2019t take over completely.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that must be, Diane\u2014when your mind doesn\u2019t quite cooperate like it used to. How do these moments of difficulty with focus and decisions affect caring for your mother or taking care of yourself? If anything specific comes to mind, feel free to share.\nPatient: Sometimes it slows me down, especially with my mother\u2019s care. It\u2019s frustrating, but I still make sure things get done. It\u2019s a strain, but I manage.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. Could you tell me a bit more about those times when focus or making decisions slows you down with your mother\u2019s care? Understanding the specific challenges you face helps me appreciate just how much you\u2019re managing\u2014and the strength it takes to keep going despite the strain.\nPatient: Sometimes I forget steps or get stuck deciding what to do first. It slows me down and frustrates me, but I push through and get the job done, even if it takes longer.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to deal with those moments, Diane\u2014forgetting steps or feeling stuck in decisions can make a big difference in your day. How do these experiences affect how you feel overall, beyond the frustration? If you want, you can share any specific examples or feelings that come up; I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It\u2019s more than just frustration\u2014it sometimes feels like I\u2019m stuck, slowed down by the fog. Like when I forget a part of a routine, or can\u2019t decide what to tackle first. It\u2019s overwhelming at times, but I keep pushing through, even if it wears me down.\nDoctor: That \u2018fog\u2019 you describe sounds heavy and exhausting, Diane, and it\u2019s clear how much you carry just to keep moving forward. It takes real resilience to push through those overwhelming moments. If it feels right, I\u2019m here to listen whenever you want to talk more about what that feels like for you.\nPatient: The fog is tiring and sticks around longer than I\u2019d like. It drags me down and makes things harder, but I keep pushing. It\u2019s exhausting, but I don\u2019t give in.\nDoctor: That exhaustion you\u2019re carrying with the fog sounds so draining, Diane, and yet here you are\u2014still pushing forward. I want you to know your experience truly matters, and I see how much strength it takes. Whenever you feel ready to share more about what this feels like or means for you, I\u2019m here patiently to listen.\nPatient: The fog wears on me, leaves me drained more often than not.

Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\nDoctor: That sounds like a quiet but meaningful shift, Diane. How often do you find yourself feeling less interested or getting less enjoyment from those activities? Does it make it harder to find the motivation to do them, or does it mostly just change how much joy they bring? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to understand what it feels like for you.\nPatient: It happens now and then\u2014not all the time. The motivation dips sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t disappear. I still go through with things and get some pleasure from them, even if it\u2019s not like before.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it\u2019s important to notice even the subtle shifts. I want to gently ask something that can be hard to talk about: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? There\u2019s no pressure to say more than you\u2019re comfortable with, but understanding this helps me support you safely and kindly.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that recently.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open with me, Diane\u2014that takes real strength. Remember, I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk, no matter what\u2019s on your mind. If you\u2019d like, I\u2019d be glad to hear a bit about what helps you when days feel especially tough.\nPatient: What helps most is keeping to my routine and focusing on what needs to be done. It\u2019s not easy, but it keeps me going. I know support is there if I need it, even if I don\u2019t always reach out.\nDoctor: Your routine and focus sound like steady anchors for you, Diane, and holding onto that takes a lot of quiet strength. It\u2019s great you recognize support is here whenever you choose to lean on it\u2014that awareness itself is a powerful resource. Whenever you feel ready, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out; you don\u2019t have to carry everything alone.\nPatient: Routine keeps me steady\u2014that\u2019s what matters most. I\u2019m aware support\u2019s here, and I appreciate that, even if I\u2019m not ready to lean on it fully yet. I\u2019ll reach out when the time comes.\nDoctor: That steadiness your routine gives you is clearly very important, Diane, and your awareness of the support around you shows a lot of insight. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take the time you need\u2014there\u2019s no rush, and you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s right to reach out. I\u2019m here for you whenever that time comes.\nPatient: Yes, routine helps me keep things in order. I know support is available, and I\u2019ll reach out if I feel ready.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that, Diane. I\u2019d like to check in about something else\u2014have you been finding it harder to concentrate or make decisions lately? Sometimes these things can be part of how mood affects us, and I\u2019m here to listen to whatever feels true for you.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s harder to focus and make decisions at times. It\u2019s frustrating when it happens, but I\u2019m still able to manage. It doesn\u2019t take over completely.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that must be, Diane\u2014when your mind doesn\u2019t quite cooperate like it used to. How do these moments of difficulty with focus and decisions affect caring for your mother or taking care of yourself? If anything specific comes to mind, feel free to share.\nPatient: Sometimes it slows me down, especially with my mother\u2019s care. It\u2019s frustrating, but I still make sure things get done. It\u2019s a strain, but I manage.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. Could you tell me a bit more about those times when focus or making decisions slows you down with your mother\u2019s care? Understanding the specific challenges you face helps me appreciate just how much you\u2019re managing\u2014and the strength it takes to keep going despite the strain.\nPatient: Sometimes I forget steps or get stuck deciding what to do first. It slows me down and frustrates me, but I push through and get the job done, even if it takes longer.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to deal with those moments, Diane\u2014forgetting steps or feeling stuck in decisions can make a big difference in your day. How do these experiences affect how you feel overall, beyond the frustration? If you want, you can share any specific examples or feelings that come up; I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It\u2019s more than just frustration\u2014it sometimes feels like I\u2019m stuck, slowed down by the fog. Like when I forget a part of a routine, or can\u2019t decide what to tackle first. It\u2019s overwhelming at times, but I keep pushing through, even if it wears me down.\nDoctor: That \u2018fog\u2019 you describe sounds heavy and exhausting, Diane, and it\u2019s clear how much you carry just to keep moving forward. It takes real resilience to push through those overwhelming moments. If it feels right, I\u2019m here to listen whenever you want to talk more about what that feels like for you.\nPatient: The fog is tiring and sticks around longer than I\u2019d like. It drags me down and makes things harder, but I keep pushing. It\u2019s exhausting, but I don\u2019t give in.\nDoctor: That exhaustion you\u2019re carrying with the fog sounds so draining, Diane, and yet here you are\u2014still pushing forward. I want you to know your experience truly matters, and I see how much strength it takes. Whenever you feel ready to share more about what this feels like or means for you, I\u2019m here patiently to listen.\nPatient: The fog wears on me, leaves me drained more often than not. It takes everything I have just to keep going day to day. I know it\u2019s a heavy burden, but I\u2019m still here, still standing.\nDoctor: You\u2019re carrying a heavy weight, Diane, and yet your resilience shines through in that you\u2019re still standing and moving forward. It\u2019s okay to recognize how difficult this is\u2014it doesn\u2019t lessen the strength it takes.

I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running.

Whenever you feel ready, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out; you don\u2019t have to carry everything alone.\nPatient: Routine keeps me steady\u2014that\u2019s what matters most. I\u2019m aware support\u2019s here, and I appreciate that, even if I\u2019m not ready to lean on it fully yet. I\u2019ll reach out when the time comes.\nDoctor: That steadiness your routine gives you is clearly very important, Diane, and your awareness of the support around you shows a lot of insight. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take the time you need\u2014there\u2019s no rush, and you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s right to reach out. I\u2019m here for you whenever that time comes.\nPatient: Yes, routine helps me keep things in order. I know support is available, and I\u2019ll reach out if I feel ready.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that, Diane. I\u2019d like to check in about something else\u2014have you been finding it harder to concentrate or make decisions lately? Sometimes these things can be part of how mood affects us, and I\u2019m here to listen to whatever feels true for you.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s harder to focus and make decisions at times. It\u2019s frustrating when it happens, but I\u2019m still able to manage. It doesn\u2019t take over completely.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that must be, Diane\u2014when your mind doesn\u2019t quite cooperate like it used to. How do these moments of difficulty with focus and decisions affect caring for your mother or taking care of yourself? If anything specific comes to mind, feel free to share.\nPatient: Sometimes it slows me down, especially with my mother\u2019s care. It\u2019s frustrating, but I still make sure things get done. It\u2019s a strain, but I manage.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. Could you tell me a bit more about those times when focus or making decisions slows you down with your mother\u2019s care? Understanding the specific challenges you face helps me appreciate just how much you\u2019re managing\u2014and the strength it takes to keep going despite the strain.\nPatient: Sometimes I forget steps or get stuck deciding what to do first. It slows me down and frustrates me, but I push through and get the job done, even if it takes longer.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to deal with those moments, Diane\u2014forgetting steps or feeling stuck in decisions can make a big difference in your day. How do these experiences affect how you feel overall, beyond the frustration? If you want, you can share any specific examples or feelings that come up; I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It\u2019s more than just frustration\u2014it sometimes feels like I\u2019m stuck, slowed down by the fog. Like when I forget a part of a routine, or can\u2019t decide what to tackle first. It\u2019s overwhelming at times, but I keep pushing through, even if it wears me down.\nDoctor: That \u2018fog\u2019 you describe sounds heavy and exhausting, Diane, and it\u2019s clear how much you carry just to keep moving forward. It takes real resilience to push through those overwhelming moments. If it feels right, I\u2019m here to listen whenever you want to talk more about what that feels like for you.\nPatient: The fog is tiring and sticks around longer than I\u2019d like. It drags me down and makes things harder, but I keep pushing. It\u2019s exhausting, but I don\u2019t give in.\nDoctor: That exhaustion you\u2019re carrying with the fog sounds so draining, Diane, and yet here you are\u2014still pushing forward. I want you to know your experience truly matters, and I see how much strength it takes. Whenever you feel ready to share more about what this feels like or means for you, I\u2019m here patiently to listen.\nPatient: The fog wears on me, leaves me drained more often than not. It takes everything I have just to keep going day to day. I know it\u2019s a heavy burden, but I\u2019m still here, still standing.\nDoctor: You\u2019re carrying a heavy weight, Diane, and yet your resilience shines through in that you\u2019re still standing and moving forward. It\u2019s okay to recognize how difficult this is\u2014it doesn\u2019t lessen the strength it takes.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, though I\u2019d say my mood isn\u2019t great these days. I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\nDoctor: That sounds like a quiet but meaningful shift, Diane. How often do you find yourself feeling less interested or getting less enjoyment from those activities? Does it make it harder to find the motivation to do them, or does it mostly just change how much joy they bring? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to understand what it feels like for you.\nPatient: It happens now and then\u2014not all the time. The motivation dips sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t disappear. I still go through with things and get some pleasure from them, even if it\u2019s not like before.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it\u2019s important to notice even the subtle shifts. I want to gently ask something that can be hard to talk about: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? There\u2019s no pressure to say more than you\u2019re comfortable with, but understanding this helps me support you safely and kindly.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that recently.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open with me, Diane\u2014that takes real strength. Remember, I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk, no matter what\u2019s on your mind. If you\u2019d like, I\u2019d be glad to hear a bit about what helps you when days feel especially tough.\nPatient: What helps most is keeping to my routine and focusing on what needs to be done. It\u2019s not easy, but it keeps me going. I know support is there if I need it, even if I don\u2019t always reach out.\nDoctor: Your routine and focus sound like steady anchors for you, Diane, and holding onto that takes a lot of quiet strength. It\u2019s great you recognize support is here whenever you choose to lean on it\u2014that awareness itself is a powerful resource. Whenever you feel ready, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out; you don\u2019t have to carry everything alone.\nPatient: Routine keeps me steady\u2014that\u2019s what matters most. I\u2019m aware support\u2019s here, and I appreciate that, even if I\u2019m not ready to lean on it fully yet.

It\u2019s frustrating when it happens, but I\u2019m still able to manage. It doesn\u2019t take over completely.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that must be, Diane\u2014when your mind doesn\u2019t quite cooperate like it used to. How do these moments of difficulty with focus and decisions affect caring for your mother or taking care of yourself? If anything specific comes to mind, feel free to share.\nPatient: Sometimes it slows me down, especially with my mother\u2019s care. It\u2019s frustrating, but I still make sure things get done. It\u2019s a strain, but I manage.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane.

Understanding the specific challenges you face helps me appreciate just how much you\u2019re managing\u2014and the strength it takes to keep going despite the strain.\nPatient: Sometimes I forget steps or get stuck deciding what to do first. It slows me down and frustrates me, but I push through and get the job done, even if it takes longer.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to deal with those moments, Diane\u2014forgetting steps or feeling stuck in decisions can make a big difference in your day.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, though I\u2019d say my mood isn\u2019t great these days. I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\nDoctor: That sounds like a quiet but meaningful shift, Diane. How often do you find yourself feeling less interested or getting less enjoyment from those activities? Does it make it harder to find the motivation to do them, or does it mostly just change how much joy they bring? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to understand what it feels like for you.\nPatient: It happens now and then\u2014not all the time. The motivation dips sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t disappear. I still go through with things and get some pleasure from them, even if it\u2019s not like before.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it\u2019s important to notice even the subtle shifts. I want to gently ask something that can be hard to talk about: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? There\u2019s no pressure to say more than you\u2019re comfortable with, but understanding this helps me support you safely and kindly.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that recently.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open with me, Diane\u2014that takes real strength. Remember, I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk, no matter what\u2019s on your mind. If you\u2019d like, I\u2019d be glad to hear a bit about what helps you when days feel especially tough.\nPatient: What helps most is keeping to my routine and focusing on what needs to be done. It\u2019s not easy, but it keeps me going. I know support is there if I need it, even if I don\u2019t always reach out.\nDoctor: Your routine and focus sound like steady anchors for you, Diane, and holding onto that takes a lot of quiet strength. It\u2019s great you recognize support is here whenever you choose to lean on it\u2014that awareness itself is a powerful resource. Whenever you feel ready, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out; you don\u2019t have to carry everything alone.\nPatient: Routine keeps me steady\u2014that\u2019s what matters most. I\u2019m aware support\u2019s here, and I appreciate that, even if I\u2019m not ready to lean on it fully yet. I\u2019ll reach out when the time comes.\nDoctor: That steadiness your routine gives you is clearly very important, Diane, and your awareness of the support around you shows a lot of insight. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take the time you need\u2014there\u2019s no rush, and you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s right to reach out. I\u2019m here for you whenever that time comes.\nPatient: Yes, routine helps me keep things in order. I know support is available, and I\u2019ll reach out if I feel ready.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that, Diane. I\u2019d like to check in about something else\u2014have you been finding it harder to concentrate or make decisions lately? Sometimes these things can be part of how mood affects us, and I\u2019m here to listen to whatever feels true for you.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s harder to focus and make decisions at times. It\u2019s frustrating when it happens, but I\u2019m still able to manage. It doesn\u2019t take over completely.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that must be, Diane\u2014when your mind doesn\u2019t quite cooperate like it used to. How do these moments of difficulty with focus and decisions affect caring for your mother or taking care of yourself? If anything specific comes to mind, feel free to share.\nPatient: Sometimes it slows me down, especially with my mother\u2019s care. It\u2019s frustrating, but I still make sure things get done. It\u2019s a strain, but I manage.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. Could you tell me a bit more about those times when focus or making decisions slows you down with your mother\u2019s care? Understanding the specific challenges you face helps me appreciate just how much you\u2019re managing\u2014and the strength it takes to keep going despite the strain.\nPatient: Sometimes I forget steps or get stuck deciding what to do first. It slows me down and frustrates me, but I push through and get the job done, even if it takes longer.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to deal with those moments, Diane\u2014forgetting steps or feeling stuck in decisions can make a big difference in your day. How do these experiences affect how you feel overall, beyond the frustration? If you want, you can share any specific examples or feelings that come up; I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It\u2019s more than just frustration\u2014it sometimes feels like I\u2019m stuck, slowed down by the fog. Like when I forget a part of a routine, or can\u2019t decide what to tackle first. It\u2019s overwhelming at times, but I keep pushing through, even if it wears me down.\nDoctor: That \u2018fog\u2019 you describe sounds heavy and exhausting, Diane, and it\u2019s clear how much you carry just to keep moving forward. It takes real resilience to push through those overwhelming moments. If it feels right, I\u2019m here to listen whenever you want to talk more about what that feels like for you.\nPatient: The fog is tiring and sticks around longer than I\u2019d like. It drags me down and makes things harder, but I keep pushing. It\u2019s exhausting, but I don\u2019t give in.\nDoctor: That exhaustion you\u2019re carrying with the fog sounds so draining, Diane, and yet here you are\u2014still pushing forward. I want you to know your experience truly matters, and I see how much strength it takes. Whenever you feel ready to share more about what this feels like or means for you, I\u2019m here patiently to listen.\nPatient: The fog wears on me, leaves me drained more often than not. It takes everything I have just to keep going day to day. I know it\u2019s a heavy burden, but I\u2019m still here, still standing.\nDoctor: You\u2019re carrying a heavy weight, Diane, and yet your resilience shines through in that you\u2019re still standing and moving forward. It\u2019s okay to recognize how difficult this is\u2014it doesn\u2019t lessen the strength it takes. Whenever you\u2019re ready to share more or simply be heard, this space is here for you.\nPatient: It\u2019s a heavy weight and I feel it every day. But I refuse to give in. I appreciate knowing there\u2019s support when I need it, even if I\u2019m not ready to lean on it fully. I keep managing on my own.\nDoctor: That heaviness you carry really comes through, Diane, and it makes sense that it would wear down your energy.

I want to understand what this looks like for you.\nPatient: The fatigue is always there, especially in the afternoons when my mother\u2019s care feels heavier. It wears me down, but I push through.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, though I\u2019d say my mood isn\u2019t great these days. I\u2019ve been feeling tired more often, and sometimes my mind just doesn\u2019t focus well. It\u2019s been that way for a little while now.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. When you say you\u2019re feeling more tired and having trouble focusing, could you tell me a bit more about that? Like, when do these feelings usually come up during your day, and how do they affect the things you need to do? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: The tiredness and trouble concentrating don\u2019t happen all the time. They come and go, usually in the afternoons. Sometimes it makes it harder to finish what I\u2019m doing, but I usually manage to get by. It\u2019s not constant, just enough to notice.\nDoctor: That makes sense, Diane. Since these feelings come and go, I'm curious about your sleep\u2014how have you been sleeping lately? Are you finding it restful, or do you notice any changes that might connect to the tiredness and concentration struggles?\nPatient: My sleep\u2019s been pretty much the same as usual. No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\nDoctor: That sounds like a quiet but meaningful shift, Diane. How often do you find yourself feeling less interested or getting less enjoyment from those activities? Does it make it harder to find the motivation to do them, or does it mostly just change how much joy they bring? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to understand what it feels like for you.\nPatient: It happens now and then\u2014not all the time. The motivation dips sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t disappear. I still go through with things and get some pleasure from them, even if it\u2019s not like before.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it\u2019s important to notice even the subtle shifts. I want to gently ask something that can be hard to talk about: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? There\u2019s no pressure to say more than you\u2019re comfortable with, but understanding this helps me support you safely and kindly.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that recently.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open with me, Diane\u2014that takes real strength. Remember, I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk, no matter what\u2019s on your mind. If you\u2019d like, I\u2019d be glad to hear a bit about what helps you when days feel especially tough.\nPatient: What helps most is keeping to my routine and focusing on what needs to be done. It\u2019s not easy, but it keeps me going. I know support is there if I need it, even if I don\u2019t always reach out.\nDoctor: Your routine and focus sound like steady anchors for you, Diane, and holding onto that takes a lot of quiet strength. It\u2019s great you recognize support is here whenever you choose to lean on it\u2014that awareness itself is a powerful resource. Whenever you feel ready, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out; you don\u2019t have to carry everything alone.\nPatient: Routine keeps me steady\u2014that\u2019s what matters most. I\u2019m aware support\u2019s here, and I appreciate that, even if I\u2019m not ready to lean on it fully yet. I\u2019ll reach out when the time comes.\nDoctor: That steadiness your routine gives you is clearly very important, Diane, and your awareness of the support around you shows a lot of insight. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take the time you need\u2014there\u2019s no rush, and you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s right to reach out. I\u2019m here for you whenever that time comes.\nPatient: Yes, routine helps me keep things in order. I know support is available, and I\u2019ll reach out if I feel ready.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that, Diane. I\u2019d like to check in about something else\u2014have you been finding it harder to concentrate or make decisions lately? Sometimes these things can be part of how mood affects us, and I\u2019m here to listen to whatever feels true for you.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s harder to focus and make decisions at times. It\u2019s frustrating when it happens, but I\u2019m still able to manage. It doesn\u2019t take over completely.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that must be, Diane\u2014when your mind doesn\u2019t quite cooperate like it used to. How do these moments of difficulty with focus and decisions affect caring for your mother or taking care of yourself? If anything specific comes to mind, feel free to share.\nPatient: Sometimes it slows me down, especially with my mother\u2019s care. It\u2019s frustrating, but I still make sure things get done. It\u2019s a strain, but I manage.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. Could you tell me a bit more about those times when focus or making decisions slows you down with your mother\u2019s care? Understanding the specific challenges you face helps me appreciate just how much you\u2019re managing\u2014and the strength it takes to keep going despite the strain.\nPatient: Sometimes I forget steps or get stuck deciding what to do first. It slows me down and frustrates me, but I push through and get the job done, even if it takes longer.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to deal with those moments, Diane\u2014forgetting steps or feeling stuck in decisions can make a big difference in your day. How do these experiences affect how you feel overall, beyond the frustration? If you want, you can share any specific examples or feelings that come up; I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It\u2019s more than just frustration\u2014it sometimes feels like I\u2019m stuck, slowed down by the fog. Like when I forget a part of a routine, or can\u2019t decide what to tackle first. It\u2019s overwhelming at times, but I keep pushing through, even if it wears me down.\nDoctor: That \u2018fog\u2019 you describe sounds heavy and exhausting, Diane, and it\u2019s clear how much you carry just to keep moving forward. It takes real resilience to push through those overwhelming moments. If it feels right, I\u2019m here to listen whenever you want to talk more about what that feels like for you.\nPatient: The fog is tiring and sticks around longer than I\u2019d like. It drags me down and makes things harder, but I keep pushing. It\u2019s exhausting, but I don\u2019t give in.\nDoctor: That exhaustion you\u2019re carrying with the fog sounds so draining, Diane, and yet here you are\u2014still pushing forward. I want you to know your experience truly matters, and I see how much strength it takes. Whenever you feel ready to share more about what this feels like or means for you, I\u2019m here patiently to listen.\nPatient: The fog wears on me, leaves me drained more often than not. It takes everything I have just to keep going day to day. I know it\u2019s a heavy burden, but I\u2019m still here, still standing.\nDoctor: You\u2019re carrying a heavy weight, Diane, and yet your resilience shines through in that you\u2019re still standing and moving forward. It\u2019s okay to recognize how difficult this is\u2014it doesn\u2019t lessen the strength it takes. Whenever you\u2019re ready to share more or simply be heard, this space is here for you.\nPatient: It\u2019s a heavy weight and I feel it every day. But I refuse to give in. I appreciate knowing there\u2019s support when I need it, even if I\u2019m not ready to lean on it fully. I keep managing on my own.\nDoctor: That heaviness you carry really comes through, Diane, and it makes sense that it would wear down your energy. Can you tell me more about how your energy levels have been lately\u2014especially how this fatigue affects your day-to-day life and caring for your mother? I want to understand what this looks like for you.\nPatient: The fatigue is always there, especially in the afternoons when my mother\u2019s care feels heavier. It wears me down, but I push through. Despite feeling worn out, I still prioritize what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Diane, the endurance you show\u2014that steady effort day after day\u2014is truly remarkable. Carrying that fatigue while caring for your mother must make things so much harder, yet you keep going. I want you to know you\u2019re not alone in this, and I deeply admire the strength you bring to each day.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nDiane, the endurance you show\u2014that steady effort day after day\u2014is truly remarkable.

No real issues there. I don\u2019t think sleep\u2019s the problem.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Diane. When those moments of tiredness and trouble focusing come on in the afternoon, how does that feel to you? And does it change the way you\u2019re able to care for your mother or manage other parts of your day? It\u2019s okay to share whatever feels comfortable.\nPatient: It\u2019s frustrating at times, I won\u2019t deny that. But I still get through the day and take care of things, including my mother. It\u2019s more of a bother than anything that really stops me. I manage, even when it\u2019s not easy.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying quite a load, Diane, and managing despite some real frustrations\u2014that takes a lot of strength. Balancing caregiving with everything else isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m here to understand more about how that\u2019s been for you, if you\u2019d like to talk about it.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely not easy. Some days are more frustrating than others, but I keep going. There\u2019s a lot to handle, but I\u2019m used to holding things together, even when it feels like too much.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a remarkable ability to hold it all together, especially with so much on your plate. That kind of strength can be exhausting, though. With everything you\u2019re managing, have you noticed if your mood has felt down or low more often lately\u2014beyond just the tiredness and frustration?\nPatient: Yes, my mood\u2019s been pretty low most days, not just because of being tired or frustrated. Still, I get through it all somehow. There\u2019s a burden, no doubt, but I keep going.\nDoctor: That sounds really heavy, Diane\u2014carrying that low mood each day, even while pushing through. Would it be okay if you told me a bit more about how that low mood feels for you day to day? Are there moments when it feels stronger or maybe even lighter? Whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: Some days the low mood is heavier, like a weight pressing in, and other times it\u2019s just there, dull but persistent. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019ve learned to cope with it. It\u2019s always with me, but I still find the strength to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: I hear the weight you\u2019re carrying, Diane\u2014that steady, pressing low mood alongside the quieter, constant presence. It\u2019s no small thing to live with that day after day and still find the strength to keep going. I\u2019m curious, when things feel that heavy, what helps you hold on? How do you find the strength to keep moving forward?\nPatient: Mostly, I just stick to my routine and focus on what needs to be done\u2014taking care of my mother, keeping things running. I don\u2019t often dwell on feeling worthless, though sometimes the burden presses in. It\u2019s tiring, but I manage to push through without letting it overwhelm me.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it sounds like your routine is both a challenge and a pillar for you. I want to ask gently: Have you noticed any times recently when you\u2019ve felt really worthless or burdened by guilt? There\u2019s absolutely no judgment here; understanding these feelings helps me better support you. Take your time.\nPatient: There are moments when I feel worthless, but they don\u2019t come often. The burden presses on me sometimes, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I don\u2019t let it take over.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, even when those feelings come just in moments, Diane. It takes a lot of strength to keep them from taking over, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to help hold that space with you. If you ever want to talk more about those moments, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Those feelings are hard, but I manage to keep them in check. It helps to know there\u2019s support, even if I don\u2019t talk much about it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear knowing support is here makes a difference, Diane\u2014and I truly respect how you manage those tough feelings. Whenever you feel ready or need to share more, this is a safe space for that, at your pace and on your terms.\nPatient: Thank you. I do my best to handle things on my own, but it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s someone to turn to if I need it. I might talk more when I\u2019m ready.\nDoctor: That sounds like a wise approach, Diane\u2014taking things in your own time. When you feel comfortable, I\u2019d also like to ask about your appetite or any changes in your weight recently. Have you noticed anything different there? It\u2019s just part of understanding the bigger picture, and there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same. Nothing has really changed.\nDoctor: Thank you for that, Diane. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how you move or speak\u2014like feeling more restless than usual or maybe moving and talking more slowly? Sometimes these things can be subtle, so whatever feels most natural for you to share is fine.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in how I move or speak. Things feel the same as usual.\nDoctor: That\u2019s helpful to know, Diane. I\u2019d like to ask how things have been with activities you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested in them lately, or maybe the pleasure you get from them has changed? It\u2019s quite common to notice shifts like this when mood is low, even if it feels subtle or comes and goes.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed a bit less interest in some things I usually like, but it\u2019s not a big change. The pleasure isn\u2019t the same sometimes, but I still do those things when I can.\nDoctor: That sounds like a quiet but meaningful shift, Diane. How often do you find yourself feeling less interested or getting less enjoyment from those activities? Does it make it harder to find the motivation to do them, or does it mostly just change how much joy they bring? Take your time\u2014I\u2019m here to understand what it feels like for you.\nPatient: It happens now and then\u2014not all the time. The motivation dips sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t disappear. I still go through with things and get some pleasure from them, even if it\u2019s not like before.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane\u2014it\u2019s important to notice even the subtle shifts. I want to gently ask something that can be hard to talk about: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? There\u2019s no pressure to say more than you\u2019re comfortable with, but understanding this helps me support you safely and kindly.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that recently.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open with me, Diane\u2014that takes real strength. Remember, I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk, no matter what\u2019s on your mind. If you\u2019d like, I\u2019d be glad to hear a bit about what helps you when days feel especially tough.\nPatient: What helps most is keeping to my routine and focusing on what needs to be done. It\u2019s not easy, but it keeps me going. I know support is there if I need it, even if I don\u2019t always reach out.\nDoctor: Your routine and focus sound like steady anchors for you, Diane, and holding onto that takes a lot of quiet strength. It\u2019s great you recognize support is here whenever you choose to lean on it\u2014that awareness itself is a powerful resource. Whenever you feel ready, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out; you don\u2019t have to carry everything alone.\nPatient: Routine keeps me steady\u2014that\u2019s what matters most. I\u2019m aware support\u2019s here, and I appreciate that, even if I\u2019m not ready to lean on it fully yet. I\u2019ll reach out when the time comes.\nDoctor: That steadiness your routine gives you is clearly very important, Diane, and your awareness of the support around you shows a lot of insight. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take the time you need\u2014there\u2019s no rush, and you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s right to reach out. I\u2019m here for you whenever that time comes.\nPatient: Yes, routine helps me keep things in order. I know support is available, and I\u2019ll reach out if I feel ready.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that, Diane. I\u2019d like to check in about something else\u2014have you been finding it harder to concentrate or make decisions lately? Sometimes these things can be part of how mood affects us, and I\u2019m here to listen to whatever feels true for you.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s harder to focus and make decisions at times. It\u2019s frustrating when it happens, but I\u2019m still able to manage. It doesn\u2019t take over completely.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that must be, Diane\u2014when your mind doesn\u2019t quite cooperate like it used to. How do these moments of difficulty with focus and decisions affect caring for your mother or taking care of yourself? If anything specific comes to mind, feel free to share.\nPatient: Sometimes it slows me down, especially with my mother\u2019s care. It\u2019s frustrating, but I still make sure things get done. It\u2019s a strain, but I manage.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that, Diane. Could you tell me a bit more about those times when focus or making decisions slows you down with your mother\u2019s care? Understanding the specific challenges you face helps me appreciate just how much you\u2019re managing\u2014and the strength it takes to keep going despite the strain.\nPatient: Sometimes I forget steps or get stuck deciding what to do first. It slows me down and frustrates me, but I push through and get the job done, even if it takes longer.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to deal with those moments, Diane\u2014forgetting steps or feeling stuck in decisions can make a big difference in your day. How do these experiences affect how you feel overall, beyond the frustration? If you want, you can share any specific examples or feelings that come up; I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It\u2019s more than just frustration\u2014it sometimes feels like I\u2019m stuck, slowed down by the fog. Like when I forget a part of a routine, or can\u2019t decide what to tackle first. It\u2019s overwhelming at times, but I keep pushing through, even if it wears me down.\nDoctor: That \u2018fog\u2019 you describe sounds heavy and exhausting, Diane, and it\u2019s clear how much you carry just to keep moving forward. It takes real resilience to push through those overwhelming moments. If it feels right, I\u2019m here to listen whenever you want to talk more about what that feels like for you.\nPatient: The fog is tiring and sticks around longer than I\u2019d like. It drags me down and makes things harder, but I keep pushing. It\u2019s exhausting, but I don\u2019t give in.\nDoctor: That exhaustion you\u2019re carrying with the fog sounds so draining, Diane, and yet here you are\u2014still pushing forward. I want you to know your experience truly matters, and I see how much strength it takes. Whenever you feel ready to share more about what this feels like or means for you, I\u2019m here patiently to listen.\nPatient: The fog wears on me, leaves me drained more often than not. It takes everything I have just to keep going day to day. I know it\u2019s a heavy burden, but I\u2019m still here, still standing.\nDoctor: You\u2019re carrying a heavy weight, Diane, and yet your resilience shines through in that you\u2019re still standing and moving forward. It\u2019s okay to recognize how difficult this is\u2014it doesn\u2019t lessen the strength it takes. Whenever you\u2019re ready to share more or simply be heard, this space is here for you.\nPatient: It\u2019s a heavy weight and I feel it every day. But I refuse to give in. I appreciate knowing there\u2019s support when I need it, even if I\u2019m not ready to lean on it fully. I keep managing on my own.\nDoctor: That heaviness you carry really comes through, Diane, and it makes sense that it would wear down your energy. Can you tell me more about how your energy levels have been lately\u2014especially how this fatigue affects your day-to-day life and caring for your mother? I want to understand what this looks like for you.\nPatient: The fatigue is always there, especially in the afternoons when my mother\u2019s care feels heavier. It wears me down, but I push through. Despite feeling worn out, I still prioritize what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Diane, the endurance you show\u2014that steady effort day after day\u2014is truly remarkable. Carrying that fatigue while caring for your mother must make things so much harder, yet you keep going. I want you to know you\u2019re not alone in this, and I deeply admire the strength you bring to each day.\nPatient: Thank you. The fatigue is constant, and caregiving is a heavy burden, but I stick to my routine and keep going. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m determined to do it.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
