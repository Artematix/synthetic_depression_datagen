Higher symptom severity should show up as more impact on daily life, relationships, or goals. Lower severity should feel milder.\n- Keep trauma and serious adversity realistic and not universal. Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

It\u2019s like the motivation to do them just isn\u2019t there like it used to be. Along with that, I sometimes feel physically slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to keep up, though other times I feel a bit restless, unable to settle properly.

It\u2019s been making it harder to keep a regular routine or focus on anything for too long.\nDoctor: Sounds like motivation and energy are really off, plus some physical sluggishness mixed with restlessness. When you say things you used to enjoy don\u2019t hold interest, do you find you\u2019re pretty much unable to feel any pleasure from them now, or is it just less than before?\nPatient: It\u2019s more that the pleasure is still there, but it\u2019s much less than it used to be. I can still get some enjoyment from things, but it feels harder to fully engage. There\u2019s effort involved now that wasn\u2019t there before, and even when I do push myself, it doesn\u2019t feel as rewarding. It\u2019s like the spark is dimmed, but not completely gone.\nDoctor: Reduced enjoyment and more effort just to get through activities\u2014it\u2019s good you can still get some pleasure, but this sounds like it\u2019s wearing on you. How is this dimmed spark affecting your daily routine or getting through tasks you need to do?\nPatient: It definitely makes daily tasks more tiring than they used to be. Things that were once automatic or easy now take more effort to complete, and that extra effort wears on me over time. Because of that, it\u2019s harder to keep a consistent routine\u2014I find myself pushing through or postponing things more often. The fatigue feels like it just makes everything a bit heavier, so sticking with what I need to do doesn\u2019t come as naturally as before.\nDoctor: So the fatigue basically drags everything down, making even automatic stuff a challenge. Can you give me a specific example where this extra effort really got in the way of something you had to do recently?\nPatient: Sure. Just the other day, I needed to tidy up my place, which used to be something I could get through pretty quickly.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been noticing, over the past few weeks, things I used to enjoy don\u2019t really hold the same interest for me anymore. It\u2019s like the motivation to do them just isn\u2019t there like it used to be. Along with that, I sometimes feel physically slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to keep up, though other times I feel a bit restless, unable to settle properly. Most days, I just feel tired or drained, even if I haven\u2019t done much\u2014like my energy is low all the time. It\u2019s been making it harder to keep a regular routine or focus on anything for too long.\nDoctor: Sounds like motivation and energy are really off, plus some physical sluggishness mixed with restlessness. When you say things you used to enjoy don\u2019t hold interest, do you find you\u2019re pretty much unable to feel any pleasure from them now, or is it just less than before?\nPatient: It\u2019s more that the pleasure is still there, but it\u2019s much less than it used to be. I can still get some enjoyment from things, but it feels harder to fully engage. There\u2019s effort involved now that wasn\u2019t there before, and even when I do push myself, it doesn\u2019t feel as rewarding. It\u2019s like the spark is dimmed, but not completely gone.\nDoctor: Reduced enjoyment and more effort just to get through activities\u2014it\u2019s good you can still get some pleasure, but this sounds like it\u2019s wearing on you. How is this dimmed spark affecting your daily routine or getting through tasks you need to do?\nPatient: It definitely makes daily tasks more tiring than they used to be. Things that were once automatic or easy now take more effort to complete, and that extra effort wears on me over time. Because of that, it\u2019s harder to keep a consistent routine\u2014I find myself pushing through or postponing things more often. The fatigue feels like it just makes everything a bit heavier, so sticking with what I need to do doesn\u2019t come as naturally as before.\nDoctor: So the fatigue basically drags everything down, making even automatic stuff a challenge. Can you give me a specific example where this extra effort really got in the way of something you had to do recently?\nPatient: Sure. Just the other day, I needed to tidy up my place, which used to be something I could get through pretty quickly. But recently, it took a lot more time than usual, and I had to take breaks in between because I kept feeling drained. What should have been a straightforward task ended up feeling quite exhausting, and I wasn\u2019t able to keep the pace I normally would.\nDoctor: Got it. That tidying up taking longer with breaks sounds like a clear sign of how much energy you\u2019re missing. How often do you find yourself feeling this drained or low-energy? And is it hitting other parts of your life the same way?\nPatient: It\u2019s most days that I feel this kind of fatigue or low energy. It\u2019s not just the tidying or chores, but other things too\u2014like getting through work-related tasks when I was employed, or even simple things like preparing meals or managing my schedule.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been noticing, over the past few weeks, things I used to enjoy don\u2019t really hold the same interest for me anymore. It\u2019s like the motivation to do them just isn\u2019t there like it used to be. Along with that, I sometimes feel physically slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to keep up, though other times I feel a bit restless, unable to settle properly. Most days, I just feel tired or drained, even if I haven\u2019t done much\u2014like my energy is low all the time. It\u2019s been making it harder to keep a regular routine or focus on anything for too long.\nDoctor: Sounds like motivation and energy are really off, plus some physical sluggishness mixed with restlessness. When you say things you used to enjoy don\u2019t hold interest, do you find you\u2019re pretty much unable to feel any pleasure from them now, or is it just less than before?\nPatient: It\u2019s more that the pleasure is still there, but it\u2019s much less than it used to be. I can still get some enjoyment from things, but it feels harder to fully engage. There\u2019s effort involved now that wasn\u2019t there before, and even when I do push myself, it doesn\u2019t feel as rewarding. It\u2019s like the spark is dimmed, but not completely gone.\nDoctor: Reduced enjoyment and more effort just to get through activities\u2014it\u2019s good you can still get some pleasure, but this sounds like it\u2019s wearing on you. How is this dimmed spark affecting your daily routine or getting through tasks you need to do?\nPatient: It definitely makes daily tasks more tiring than they used to be. Things that were once automatic or easy now take more effort to complete, and that extra effort wears on me over time. Because of that, it\u2019s harder to keep a consistent routine\u2014I find myself pushing through or postponing things more often. The fatigue feels like it just makes everything a bit heavier, so sticking with what I need to do doesn\u2019t come as naturally as before.\nDoctor: So the fatigue basically drags everything down, making even automatic stuff a challenge. Can you give me a specific example where this extra effort really got in the way of something you had to do recently?\nPatient: Sure. Just the other day, I needed to tidy up my place, which used to be something I could get through pretty quickly. But recently, it took a lot more time than usual, and I had to take breaks in between because I kept feeling drained. What should have been a straightforward task ended up feeling quite exhausting, and I wasn\u2019t able to keep the pace I normally would.\nDoctor: Got it. That tidying up taking longer with breaks sounds like a clear sign of how much energy you\u2019re missing. How often do you find yourself feeling this drained or low-energy? And is it hitting other parts of your life the same way?\nPatient: It\u2019s most days that I feel this kind of fatigue or low energy. It\u2019s not just the tidying or chores, but other things too\u2014like getting through work-related tasks when I was employed, or even simple things like preparing meals or managing my schedule. Most activities require more effort than they did before, and it feels like I\u2019m constantly pushing against that tiredness just to keep going.\nDoctor: You say this low energy hits most days and makes simple tasks harder\u2014how is it messing with your focus or ability to get things done throughout the day? Are there times when you feel a bit better or worse?\nPatient: The fatigue definitely affects my focus and concentration. I find it harder to stay on one thing for long without my mind wandering or feeling like I\u2019m dragging through it. Tasks take more effort not just physically, but mentally as well. There are moments when my energy is a bit better, but they\u2019re usually brief and don\u2019t last long.

How is this dimmed spark affecting your daily routine or getting through tasks you need to do?\nPatient: It definitely makes daily tasks more tiring than they used to be. Things that were once automatic or easy now take more effort to complete, and that extra effort wears on me over time. Because of that, it\u2019s harder to keep a consistent routine\u2014I find myself pushing through or postponing things more often. The fatigue feels like it just makes everything a bit heavier, so sticking with what I need to do doesn\u2019t come as naturally as before.\nDoctor: So the fatigue basically drags everything down, making even automatic stuff a challenge. Can you give me a specific example where this extra effort really got in the way of something you had to do recently?\nPatient: Sure. Just the other day, I needed to tidy up my place, which used to be something I could get through pretty quickly. But recently, it took a lot more time than usual, and I had to take breaks in between because I kept feeling drained. What should have been a straightforward task ended up feeling quite exhausting, and I wasn\u2019t able to keep the pace I normally would.\nDoctor: Got it. That tidying up taking longer with breaks sounds like a clear sign of how much energy you\u2019re missing. How often do you find yourself feeling this drained or low-energy? And is it hitting other parts of your life the same way?\nPatient: It\u2019s most days that I feel this kind of fatigue or low energy. It\u2019s not just the tidying or chores, but other things too\u2014like getting through work-related tasks when I was employed, or even simple things like preparing meals or managing my schedule. Most activities require more effort than they did before, and it feels like I\u2019m constantly pushing against that tiredness just to keep going.\nDoctor: You say this low energy hits most days and makes simple tasks harder\u2014how is it messing with your focus or ability to get things done throughout the day? Are there times when you feel a bit better or worse?\nPatient: The fatigue definitely affects my focus and concentration. I find it harder to stay on one thing for long without my mind wandering or feeling like I\u2019m dragging through it. Tasks take more effort not just physically, but mentally as well. There are moments when my energy is a bit better, but they\u2019re usually brief and don\u2019t last long. Overall, the low energy is a constant backdrop that slows everything down.\nDoctor: So your concentration drags and decision-making probably follows. Are you finding it harder to make even simple decisions these days, or hold your focus when you need to, like when sorting out daily stuff or figuring out your next steps?\nPatient: Yes, it\u2019s definitely harder to make even simple decisions now. What used to be straightforward feels more complex, and I often have to talk myself through choices out loud just to make sense of them. Holding focus on tasks or figuring out what to do next takes more mental energy than it used to, and that mental fatigue builds up quickly over the day. It makes even routine things feel more challenging.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nYes, it\u2019s definitely harder to make even simple decisions now.

It\u2019s not just the tidying or chores, but other things too\u2014like getting through work-related tasks when I was employed, or even simple things like preparing meals or managing my schedule. Most activities require more effort than they did before, and it feels like I\u2019m constantly pushing against that tiredness just to keep going.\nDoctor: You say this low energy hits most days and makes simple tasks harder\u2014how is it messing with your focus or ability to get things done throughout the day? Are there times when you feel a bit better or worse?\nPatient: The fatigue definitely affects my focus and concentration. I find it harder to stay on one thing for long without my mind wandering or feeling like I\u2019m dragging through it. Tasks take more effort not just physically, but mentally as well. There are moments when my energy is a bit better, but they\u2019re usually brief and don\u2019t last long. Overall, the low energy is a constant backdrop that slows everything down.\nDoctor: So your concentration drags and decision-making probably follows. Are you finding it harder to make even simple decisions these days, or hold your focus when you need to, like when sorting out daily stuff or figuring out your next steps?\nPatient: Yes, it\u2019s definitely harder to make even simple decisions now. What used to be straightforward feels more complex, and I often have to talk myself through choices out loud just to make sense of them. Holding focus on tasks or figuring out what to do next takes more mental energy than it used to, and that mental fatigue builds up quickly over the day. It makes even routine things feel more challenging.\nDoctor: Alright. Beyond the tiredness and concentration issues, how have your moods been lately? Do you find yourself feeling down, empty, or hopeless much of the time?\nPatient: Actually, I wouldn\u2019t say my mood feels particularly down or hopeless. Most of the time, it\u2019s more neutral\u2014like I\u2019m just running on low energy and mental exhaustion rather than feeling strong emotions. I feel drained physically and mentally, but my mood itself hasn\u2019t shifted dramatically to something darker. It\u2019s more a persistent sense of weariness than anything else.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nActually, I wouldn\u2019t say my mood feels particularly down or hopeless.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been noticing, over the past few weeks, things I used to enjoy don\u2019t really hold the same interest for me anymore. It\u2019s like the motivation to do them just isn\u2019t there like it used to be. Along with that, I sometimes feel physically slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to keep up, though other times I feel a bit restless, unable to settle properly. Most days, I just feel tired or drained, even if I haven\u2019t done much\u2014like my energy is low all the time. It\u2019s been making it harder to keep a regular routine or focus on anything for too long.\nDoctor: Sounds like motivation and energy are really off, plus some physical sluggishness mixed with restlessness. When you say things you used to enjoy don\u2019t hold interest, do you find you\u2019re pretty much unable to feel any pleasure from them now, or is it just less than before?\nPatient: It\u2019s more that the pleasure is still there, but it\u2019s much less than it used to be. I can still get some enjoyment from things, but it feels harder to fully engage. There\u2019s effort involved now that wasn\u2019t there before, and even when I do push myself, it doesn\u2019t feel as rewarding. It\u2019s like the spark is dimmed, but not completely gone.\nDoctor: Reduced enjoyment and more effort just to get through activities\u2014it\u2019s good you can still get some pleasure, but this sounds like it\u2019s wearing on you. How is this dimmed spark affecting your daily routine or getting through tasks you need to do?\nPatient: It definitely makes daily tasks more tiring than they used to be. Things that were once automatic or easy now take more effort to complete, and that extra effort wears on me over time. Because of that, it\u2019s harder to keep a consistent routine\u2014I find myself pushing through or postponing things more often. The fatigue feels like it just makes everything a bit heavier, so sticking with what I need to do doesn\u2019t come as naturally as before.\nDoctor: So the fatigue basically drags everything down, making even automatic stuff a challenge. Can you give me a specific example where this extra effort really got in the way of something you had to do recently?\nPatient: Sure. Just the other day, I needed to tidy up my place, which used to be something I could get through pretty quickly. But recently, it took a lot more time than usual, and I had to take breaks in between because I kept feeling drained. What should have been a straightforward task ended up feeling quite exhausting, and I wasn\u2019t able to keep the pace I normally would.\nDoctor: Got it. That tidying up taking longer with breaks sounds like a clear sign of how much energy you\u2019re missing. How often do you find yourself feeling this drained or low-energy?

Are you finding it harder to make even simple decisions these days, or hold your focus when you need to, like when sorting out daily stuff or figuring out your next steps?\nPatient: Yes, it\u2019s definitely harder to make even simple decisions now. What used to be straightforward feels more complex, and I often have to talk myself through choices out loud just to make sense of them. Holding focus on tasks or figuring out what to do next takes more mental energy than it used to, and that mental fatigue builds up quickly over the day. It makes even routine things feel more challenging.\nDoctor: Alright. Beyond the tiredness and concentration issues, how have your moods been lately? Do you find yourself feeling down, empty, or hopeless much of the time?\nPatient: Actually, I wouldn\u2019t say my mood feels particularly down or hopeless. Most of the time, it\u2019s more neutral\u2014like I\u2019m just running on low energy and mental exhaustion rather than feeling strong emotions. I feel drained physically and mentally, but my mood itself hasn\u2019t shifted dramatically to something darker. It\u2019s more a persistent sense of weariness than anything else.\nDoctor: Understood. Are you having any thoughts about death or suicide?

What brings you in today?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been noticing, over the past few weeks, things I used to enjoy don\u2019t really hold the same interest for me anymore. It\u2019s like the motivation to do them just isn\u2019t there like it used to be. Along with that, I sometimes feel physically slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to keep up, though other times I feel a bit restless, unable to settle properly. Most days, I just feel tired or drained, even if I haven\u2019t done much\u2014like my energy is low all the time. It\u2019s been making it harder to keep a regular routine or focus on anything for too long.\nDoctor: Sounds like motivation and energy are really off, plus some physical sluggishness mixed with restlessness. When you say things you used to enjoy don\u2019t hold interest, do you find you\u2019re pretty much unable to feel any pleasure from them now, or is it just less than before?\nPatient: It\u2019s more that the pleasure is still there, but it\u2019s much less than it used to be. I can still get some enjoyment from things, but it feels harder to fully engage. There\u2019s effort involved now that wasn\u2019t there before, and even when I do push myself, it doesn\u2019t feel as rewarding. It\u2019s like the spark is dimmed, but not completely gone.\nDoctor: Reduced enjoyment and more effort just to get through activities\u2014it\u2019s good you can still get some pleasure, but this sounds like it\u2019s wearing on you. How is this dimmed spark affecting your daily routine or getting through tasks you need to do?\nPatient: It definitely makes daily tasks more tiring than they used to be. Things that were once automatic or easy now take more effort to complete, and that extra effort wears on me over time. Because of that, it\u2019s harder to keep a consistent routine\u2014I find myself pushing through or postponing things more often. The fatigue feels like it just makes everything a bit heavier, so sticking with what I need to do doesn\u2019t come as naturally as before.\nDoctor: So the fatigue basically drags everything down, making even automatic stuff a challenge. Can you give me a specific example where this extra effort really got in the way of something you had to do recently?\nPatient: Sure. Just the other day, I needed to tidy up my place, which used to be something I could get through pretty quickly. But recently, it took a lot more time than usual, and I had to take breaks in between because I kept feeling drained. What should have been a straightforward task ended up feeling quite exhausting, and I wasn\u2019t able to keep the pace I normally would.\nDoctor: Got it. That tidying up taking longer with breaks sounds like a clear sign of how much energy you\u2019re missing. How often do you find yourself feeling this drained or low-energy? And is it hitting other parts of your life the same way?\nPatient: It\u2019s most days that I feel this kind of fatigue or low energy. It\u2019s not just the tidying or chores, but other things too\u2014like getting through work-related tasks when I was employed, or even simple things like preparing meals or managing my schedule. Most activities require more effort than they did before, and it feels like I\u2019m constantly pushing against that tiredness just to keep going.\nDoctor: You say this low energy hits most days and makes simple tasks harder\u2014how is it messing with your focus or ability to get things done throughout the day? Are there times when you feel a bit better or worse?\nPatient: The fatigue definitely affects my focus and concentration. I find it harder to stay on one thing for long without my mind wandering or feeling like I\u2019m dragging through it. Tasks take more effort not just physically, but mentally as well. There are moments when my energy is a bit better, but they\u2019re usually brief and don\u2019t last long. Overall, the low energy is a constant backdrop that slows everything down.\nDoctor: So your concentration drags and decision-making probably follows.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been noticing, over the past few weeks, things I used to enjoy don\u2019t really hold the same interest for me anymore. It\u2019s like the motivation to do them just isn\u2019t there like it used to be. Along with that, I sometimes feel physically slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to keep up, though other times I feel a bit restless, unable to settle properly. Most days, I just feel tired or drained, even if I haven\u2019t done much\u2014like my energy is low all the time. It\u2019s been making it harder to keep a regular routine or focus on anything for too long.\nDoctor: Sounds like motivation and energy are really off, plus some physical sluggishness mixed with restlessness. When you say things you used to enjoy don\u2019t hold interest, do you find you\u2019re pretty much unable to feel any pleasure from them now, or is it just less than before?\nPatient: It\u2019s more that the pleasure is still there, but it\u2019s much less than it used to be. I can still get some enjoyment from things, but it feels harder to fully engage. There\u2019s effort involved now that wasn\u2019t there before, and even when I do push myself, it doesn\u2019t feel as rewarding. It\u2019s like the spark is dimmed, but not completely gone.\nDoctor: Reduced enjoyment and more effort just to get through activities\u2014it\u2019s good you can still get some pleasure, but this sounds like it\u2019s wearing on you. How is this dimmed spark affecting your daily routine or getting through tasks you need to do?\nPatient: It definitely makes daily tasks more tiring than they used to be. Things that were once automatic or easy now take more effort to complete, and that extra effort wears on me over time. Because of that, it\u2019s harder to keep a consistent routine\u2014I find myself pushing through or postponing things more often. The fatigue feels like it just makes everything a bit heavier, so sticking with what I need to do doesn\u2019t come as naturally as before.\nDoctor: So the fatigue basically drags everything down, making even automatic stuff a challenge. Can you give me a specific example where this extra effort really got in the way of something you had to do recently?\nPatient: Sure. Just the other day, I needed to tidy up my place, which used to be something I could get through pretty quickly. But recently, it took a lot more time than usual, and I had to take breaks in between because I kept feeling drained. What should have been a straightforward task ended up feeling quite exhausting, and I wasn\u2019t able to keep the pace I normally would.\nDoctor: Got it. That tidying up taking longer with breaks sounds like a clear sign of how much energy you\u2019re missing. How often do you find yourself feeling this drained or low-energy? And is it hitting other parts of your life the same way?\nPatient: It\u2019s most days that I feel this kind of fatigue or low energy. It\u2019s not just the tidying or chores, but other things too\u2014like getting through work-related tasks when I was employed, or even simple things like preparing meals or managing my schedule. Most activities require more effort than they did before, and it feels like I\u2019m constantly pushing against that tiredness just to keep going.\nDoctor: You say this low energy hits most days and makes simple tasks harder\u2014how is it messing with your focus or ability to get things done throughout the day? Are there times when you feel a bit better or worse?\nPatient: The fatigue definitely affects my focus and concentration. I find it harder to stay on one thing for long without my mind wandering or feeling like I\u2019m dragging through it. Tasks take more effort not just physically, but mentally as well. There are moments when my energy is a bit better, but they\u2019re usually brief and don\u2019t last long. Overall, the low energy is a constant backdrop that slows everything down.\nDoctor: So your concentration drags and decision-making probably follows. Are you finding it harder to make even simple decisions these days, or hold your focus when you need to, like when sorting out daily stuff or figuring out your next steps?\nPatient: Yes, it\u2019s definitely harder to make even simple decisions now. What used to be straightforward feels more complex, and I often have to talk myself through choices out loud just to make sense of them. Holding focus on tasks or figuring out what to do next takes more mental energy than it used to, and that mental fatigue builds up quickly over the day. It makes even routine things feel more challenging.\nDoctor: Alright. Beyond the tiredness and concentration issues, how have your moods been lately? Do you find yourself feeling down, empty, or hopeless much of the time?\nPatient: Actually, I wouldn\u2019t say my mood feels particularly down or hopeless. Most of the time, it\u2019s more neutral\u2014like I\u2019m just running on low energy and mental exhaustion rather than feeling strong emotions.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been noticing, over the past few weeks, things I used to enjoy don\u2019t really hold the same interest for me anymore. It\u2019s like the motivation to do them just isn\u2019t there like it used to be. Along with that, I sometimes feel physically slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to keep up, though other times I feel a bit restless, unable to settle properly. Most days, I just feel tired or drained, even if I haven\u2019t done much\u2014like my energy is low all the time. It\u2019s been making it harder to keep a regular routine or focus on anything for too long.\nDoctor: Sounds like motivation and energy are really off, plus some physical sluggishness mixed with restlessness. When you say things you used to enjoy don\u2019t hold interest, do you find you\u2019re pretty much unable to feel any pleasure from them now, or is it just less than before?\nPatient: It\u2019s more that the pleasure is still there, but it\u2019s much less than it used to be. I can still get some enjoyment from things, but it feels harder to fully engage. There\u2019s effort involved now that wasn\u2019t there before, and even when I do push myself, it doesn\u2019t feel as rewarding. It\u2019s like the spark is dimmed, but not completely gone.\nDoctor: Reduced enjoyment and more effort just to get through activities\u2014it\u2019s good you can still get some pleasure, but this sounds like it\u2019s wearing on you. How is this dimmed spark affecting your daily routine or getting through tasks you need to do?\nPatient: It definitely makes daily tasks more tiring than they used to be. Things that were once automatic or easy now take more effort to complete, and that extra effort wears on me over time. Because of that, it\u2019s harder to keep a consistent routine\u2014I find myself pushing through or postponing things more often. The fatigue feels like it just makes everything a bit heavier, so sticking with what I need to do doesn\u2019t come as naturally as before.\nDoctor: So the fatigue basically drags everything down, making even automatic stuff a challenge. Can you give me a specific example where this extra effort really got in the way of something you had to do recently?\nPatient: Sure. Just the other day, I needed to tidy up my place, which used to be something I could get through pretty quickly. But recently, it took a lot more time than usual, and I had to take breaks in between because I kept feeling drained. What should have been a straightforward task ended up feeling quite exhausting, and I wasn\u2019t able to keep the pace I normally would.\nDoctor: Got it. That tidying up taking longer with breaks sounds like a clear sign of how much energy you\u2019re missing. How often do you find yourself feeling this drained or low-energy? And is it hitting other parts of your life the same way?\nPatient: It\u2019s most days that I feel this kind of fatigue or low energy. It\u2019s not just the tidying or chores, but other things too\u2014like getting through work-related tasks when I was employed, or even simple things like preparing meals or managing my schedule. Most activities require more effort than they did before, and it feels like I\u2019m constantly pushing against that tiredness just to keep going.\nDoctor: You say this low energy hits most days and makes simple tasks harder\u2014how is it messing with your focus or ability to get things done throughout the day? Are there times when you feel a bit better or worse?\nPatient: The fatigue definitely affects my focus and concentration. I find it harder to stay on one thing for long without my mind wandering or feeling like I\u2019m dragging through it. Tasks take more effort not just physically, but mentally as well. There are moments when my energy is a bit better, but they\u2019re usually brief and don\u2019t last long. Overall, the low energy is a constant backdrop that slows everything down.\nDoctor: So your concentration drags and decision-making probably follows. Are you finding it harder to make even simple decisions these days, or hold your focus when you need to, like when sorting out daily stuff or figuring out your next steps?\nPatient: Yes, it\u2019s definitely harder to make even simple decisions now. What used to be straightforward feels more complex, and I often have to talk myself through choices out loud just to make sense of them. Holding focus on tasks or figuring out what to do next takes more mental energy than it used to, and that mental fatigue builds up quickly over the day. It makes even routine things feel more challenging.\nDoctor: Alright. Beyond the tiredness and concentration issues, how have your moods been lately? Do you find yourself feeling down, empty, or hopeless much of the time?\nPatient: Actually, I wouldn\u2019t say my mood feels particularly down or hopeless. Most of the time, it\u2019s more neutral\u2014like I\u2019m just running on low energy and mental exhaustion rather than feeling strong emotions.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been noticing, over the past few weeks, things I used to enjoy don\u2019t really hold the same interest for me anymore. It\u2019s like the motivation to do them just isn\u2019t there like it used to be. Along with that, I sometimes feel physically slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to keep up, though other times I feel a bit restless, unable to settle properly. Most days, I just feel tired or drained, even if I haven\u2019t done much\u2014like my energy is low all the time. It\u2019s been making it harder to keep a regular routine or focus on anything for too long.\nDoctor: Sounds like motivation and energy are really off, plus some physical sluggishness mixed with restlessness. When you say things you used to enjoy don\u2019t hold interest, do you find you\u2019re pretty much unable to feel any pleasure from them now, or is it just less than before?\nPatient: It\u2019s more that the pleasure is still there, but it\u2019s much less than it used to be. I can still get some enjoyment from things, but it feels harder to fully engage. There\u2019s effort involved now that wasn\u2019t there before, and even when I do push myself, it doesn\u2019t feel as rewarding. It\u2019s like the spark is dimmed, but not completely gone.\nDoctor: Reduced enjoyment and more effort just to get through activities\u2014it\u2019s good you can still get some pleasure, but this sounds like it\u2019s wearing on you. How is this dimmed spark affecting your daily routine or getting through tasks you need to do?\nPatient: It definitely makes daily tasks more tiring than they used to be. Things that were once automatic or easy now take more effort to complete, and that extra effort wears on me over time. Because of that, it\u2019s harder to keep a consistent routine\u2014I find myself pushing through or postponing things more often. The fatigue feels like it just makes everything a bit heavier, so sticking with what I need to do doesn\u2019t come as naturally as before.\nDoctor: So the fatigue basically drags everything down, making even automatic stuff a challenge. Can you give me a specific example where this extra effort really got in the way of something you had to do recently?\nPatient: Sure. Just the other day, I needed to tidy up my place, which used to be something I could get through pretty quickly. But recently, it took a lot more time than usual, and I had to take breaks in between because I kept feeling drained. What should have been a straightforward task ended up feeling quite exhausting, and I wasn\u2019t able to keep the pace I normally would.\nDoctor: Got it. That tidying up taking longer with breaks sounds like a clear sign of how much energy you\u2019re missing. How often do you find yourself feeling this drained or low-energy? And is it hitting other parts of your life the same way?\nPatient: It\u2019s most days that I feel this kind of fatigue or low energy. It\u2019s not just the tidying or chores, but other things too\u2014like getting through work-related tasks when I was employed, or even simple things like preparing meals or managing my schedule. Most activities require more effort than they did before, and it feels like I\u2019m constantly pushing against that tiredness just to keep going.\nDoctor: You say this low energy hits most days and makes simple tasks harder\u2014how is it messing with your focus or ability to get things done throughout the day? Are there times when you feel a bit better or worse?\nPatient: The fatigue definitely affects my focus and concentration. I find it harder to stay on one thing for long without my mind wandering or feeling like I\u2019m dragging through it. Tasks take more effort not just physically, but mentally as well. There are moments when my energy is a bit better, but they\u2019re usually brief and don\u2019t last long. Overall, the low energy is a constant backdrop that slows everything down.\nDoctor: So your concentration drags and decision-making probably follows. Are you finding it harder to make even simple decisions these days, or hold your focus when you need to, like when sorting out daily stuff or figuring out your next steps?\nPatient: Yes, it\u2019s definitely harder to make even simple decisions now. What used to be straightforward feels more complex, and I often have to talk myself through choices out loud just to make sense of them. Holding focus on tasks or figuring out what to do next takes more mental energy than it used to, and that mental fatigue builds up quickly over the day. It makes even routine things feel more challenging.\nDoctor: Alright. Beyond the tiredness and concentration issues, how have your moods been lately? Do you find yourself feeling down, empty, or hopeless much of the time?\nPatient: Actually, I wouldn\u2019t say my mood feels particularly down or hopeless. Most of the time, it\u2019s more neutral\u2014like I\u2019m just running on low energy and mental exhaustion rather than feeling strong emotions.

Can you give me a specific example where this extra effort really got in the way of something you had to do recently?\nPatient: Sure. Just the other day, I needed to tidy up my place, which used to be something I could get through pretty quickly. But recently, it took a lot more time than usual, and I had to take breaks in between because I kept feeling drained. What should have been a straightforward task ended up feeling quite exhausting, and I wasn\u2019t able to keep the pace I normally would.\nDoctor: Got it. That tidying up taking longer with breaks sounds like a clear sign of how much energy you\u2019re missing. How often do you find yourself feeling this drained or low-energy? And is it hitting other parts of your life the same way?\nPatient: It\u2019s most days that I feel this kind of fatigue or low energy. It\u2019s not just the tidying or chores, but other things too\u2014like getting through work-related tasks when I was employed, or even simple things like preparing meals or managing my schedule. Most activities require more effort than they did before, and it feels like I\u2019m constantly pushing against that tiredness just to keep going.\nDoctor: You say this low energy hits most days and makes simple tasks harder\u2014how is it messing with your focus or ability to get things done throughout the day? Are there times when you feel a bit better or worse?\nPatient: The fatigue definitely affects my focus and concentration. I find it harder to stay on one thing for long without my mind wandering or feeling like I\u2019m dragging through it. Tasks take more effort not just physically, but mentally as well. There are moments when my energy is a bit better, but they\u2019re usually brief and don\u2019t last long. Overall, the low energy is a constant backdrop that slows everything down.\nDoctor: So your concentration drags and decision-making probably follows. Are you finding it harder to make even simple decisions these days, or hold your focus when you need to, like when sorting out daily stuff or figuring out your next steps?\nPatient: Yes, it\u2019s definitely harder to make even simple decisions now. What used to be straightforward feels more complex, and I often have to talk myself through choices out loud just to make sense of them. Holding focus on tasks or figuring out what to do next takes more mental energy than it used to, and that mental fatigue builds up quickly over the day. It makes even routine things feel more challenging.\nDoctor: Alright. Beyond the tiredness and concentration issues, how have your moods been lately? Do you find yourself feeling down, empty, or hopeless much of the time?\nPatient: Actually, I wouldn\u2019t say my mood feels particularly down or hopeless. Most of the time, it\u2019s more neutral\u2014like I\u2019m just running on low energy and mental exhaustion rather than feeling strong emotions. I feel drained physically and mentally, but my mood itself hasn\u2019t shifted dramatically to something darker. It\u2019s more a persistent sense of weariness than anything else.\nDoctor: Understood. Are you having any thoughts about death or suicide? Nothing to hesitate on\u2014just want to make sure we cover this thoroughly.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that.\nDoctor: Good to hear. How\u2019s your sleep been lately? Trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly okay. I haven\u2019t noticed any real problems with falling asleep or staying asleep, and I\u2019m not sleeping more than usual. It\u2019s been fairly consistent.\nDoctor: Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014eating more, less, or any notable shifts?\nPatient: No, nothing significant has changed with my appetite or weight.\nDoctor: Okay. Have you felt physically slowed down or, on the flip side, restless or unable to sit still much of the time?\nPatient: Yes, I have noticed at times feeling slower physically, like my movements are a bit more sluggish than usual. Occasionally, I also feel restless, but it\u2019s not constant\u2014just happening now and then. These feelings seem tied to the overall fatigue I\u2019ve been experiencing.\nDoctor: You said the sluggishness and restlessness are on and off\u2014how often do these episodes crop up? Do you notice anything that sets them off or makes them better? How do they get in the way of what you need to do day to day?\nPatient: They happen now and then, but I can\u2019t really say there\u2019s a specific pattern or trigger that sets them off. Sometimes they come up without much warning. When they do occur, they can make certain tasks a bit more difficult to get through, but usually, it doesn\u2019t completely stop me from doing what I need to.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been noticing, over the past few weeks, things I used to enjoy don\u2019t really hold the same interest for me anymore. It\u2019s like the motivation to do them just isn\u2019t there like it used to be. Along with that, I sometimes feel physically slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to keep up, though other times I feel a bit restless, unable to settle properly. Most days, I just feel tired or drained, even if I haven\u2019t done much\u2014like my energy is low all the time. It\u2019s been making it harder to keep a regular routine or focus on anything for too long.\nDoctor: Sounds like motivation and energy are really off, plus some physical sluggishness mixed with restlessness. When you say things you used to enjoy don\u2019t hold interest, do you find you\u2019re pretty much unable to feel any pleasure from them now, or is it just less than before?\nPatient: It\u2019s more that the pleasure is still there, but it\u2019s much less than it used to be. I can still get some enjoyment from things, but it feels harder to fully engage. There\u2019s effort involved now that wasn\u2019t there before, and even when I do push myself, it doesn\u2019t feel as rewarding. It\u2019s like the spark is dimmed, but not completely gone.\nDoctor: Reduced enjoyment and more effort just to get through activities\u2014it\u2019s good you can still get some pleasure, but this sounds like it\u2019s wearing on you. How is this dimmed spark affecting your daily routine or getting through tasks you need to do?\nPatient: It definitely makes daily tasks more tiring than they used to be. Things that were once automatic or easy now take more effort to complete, and that extra effort wears on me over time. Because of that, it\u2019s harder to keep a consistent routine\u2014I find myself pushing through or postponing things more often. The fatigue feels like it just makes everything a bit heavier, so sticking with what I need to do doesn\u2019t come as naturally as before.\nDoctor: So the fatigue basically drags everything down, making even automatic stuff a challenge.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been noticing, over the past few weeks, things I used to enjoy don\u2019t really hold the same interest for me anymore. It\u2019s like the motivation to do them just isn\u2019t there like it used to be. Along with that, I sometimes feel physically slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to keep up, though other times I feel a bit restless, unable to settle properly. Most days, I just feel tired or drained, even if I haven\u2019t done much\u2014like my energy is low all the time. It\u2019s been making it harder to keep a regular routine or focus on anything for too long.\nDoctor: Sounds like motivation and energy are really off, plus some physical sluggishness mixed with restlessness. When you say things you used to enjoy don\u2019t hold interest, do you find you\u2019re pretty much unable to feel any pleasure from them now, or is it just less than before?\nPatient: It\u2019s more that the pleasure is still there, but it\u2019s much less than it used to be. I can still get some enjoyment from things, but it feels harder to fully engage. There\u2019s effort involved now that wasn\u2019t there before, and even when I do push myself, it doesn\u2019t feel as rewarding. It\u2019s like the spark is dimmed, but not completely gone.\nDoctor: Reduced enjoyment and more effort just to get through activities\u2014it\u2019s good you can still get some pleasure, but this sounds like it\u2019s wearing on you. How is this dimmed spark affecting your daily routine or getting through tasks you need to do?\nPatient: It definitely makes daily tasks more tiring than they used to be. Things that were once automatic or easy now take more effort to complete, and that extra effort wears on me over time. Because of that, it\u2019s harder to keep a consistent routine\u2014I find myself pushing through or postponing things more often. The fatigue feels like it just makes everything a bit heavier, so sticking with what I need to do doesn\u2019t come as naturally as before.\nDoctor: So the fatigue basically drags everything down, making even automatic stuff a challenge. Can you give me a specific example where this extra effort really got in the way of something you had to do recently?\nPatient: Sure. Just the other day, I needed to tidy up my place, which used to be something I could get through pretty quickly. But recently, it took a lot more time than usual, and I had to take breaks in between because I kept feeling drained. What should have been a straightforward task ended up feeling quite exhausting, and I wasn\u2019t able to keep the pace I normally would.\nDoctor: Got it. That tidying up taking longer with breaks sounds like a clear sign of how much energy you\u2019re missing. How often do you find yourself feeling this drained or low-energy? And is it hitting other parts of your life the same way?\nPatient: It\u2019s most days that I feel this kind of fatigue or low energy. It\u2019s not just the tidying or chores, but other things too\u2014like getting through work-related tasks when I was employed, or even simple things like preparing meals or managing my schedule. Most activities require more effort than they did before, and it feels like I\u2019m constantly pushing against that tiredness just to keep going.\nDoctor: You say this low energy hits most days and makes simple tasks harder\u2014how is it messing with your focus or ability to get things done throughout the day? Are there times when you feel a bit better or worse?\nPatient: The fatigue definitely affects my focus and concentration. I find it harder to stay on one thing for long without my mind wandering or feeling like I\u2019m dragging through it. Tasks take more effort not just physically, but mentally as well. There are moments when my energy is a bit better, but they\u2019re usually brief and don\u2019t last long. Overall, the low energy is a constant backdrop that slows everything down.\nDoctor: So your concentration drags and decision-making probably follows. Are you finding it harder to make even simple decisions these days, or hold your focus when you need to, like when sorting out daily stuff or figuring out your next steps?\nPatient: Yes, it\u2019s definitely harder to make even simple decisions now. What used to be straightforward feels more complex, and I often have to talk myself through choices out loud just to make sense of them. Holding focus on tasks or figuring out what to do next takes more mental energy than it used to, and that mental fatigue builds up quickly over the day. It makes even routine things feel more challenging.\nDoctor: Alright. Beyond the tiredness and concentration issues, how have your moods been lately? Do you find yourself feeling down, empty, or hopeless much of the time?\nPatient: Actually, I wouldn\u2019t say my mood feels particularly down or hopeless. Most of the time, it\u2019s more neutral\u2014like I\u2019m just running on low energy and mental exhaustion rather than feeling strong emotions. I feel drained physically and mentally, but my mood itself hasn\u2019t shifted dramatically to something darker. It\u2019s more a persistent sense of weariness than anything else.\nDoctor: Understood. Are you having any thoughts about death or suicide? Nothing to hesitate on\u2014just want to make sure we cover this thoroughly.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that.\nDoctor: Good to hear. How\u2019s your sleep been lately? Trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly okay. I haven\u2019t noticed any real problems with falling asleep or staying asleep, and I\u2019m not sleeping more than usual. It\u2019s been fairly consistent.\nDoctor: Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014eating more, less, or any notable shifts?\nPatient: No, nothing significant has changed with my appetite or weight.\nDoctor: Okay. Have you felt physically slowed down or, on the flip side, restless or unable to sit still much of the time?\nPatient: Yes, I have noticed at times feeling slower physically, like my movements are a bit more sluggish than usual. Occasionally, I also feel restless, but it\u2019s not constant\u2014just happening now and then. These feelings seem tied to the overall fatigue I\u2019ve been experiencing.\nDoctor: You said the sluggishness and restlessness are on and off\u2014how often do these episodes crop up? Do you notice anything that sets them off or makes them better? How do they get in the way of what you need to do day to day?\nPatient: They happen now and then, but I can\u2019t really say there\u2019s a specific pattern or trigger that sets them off. Sometimes they come up without much warning. When they do occur, they can make certain tasks a bit more difficult to get through, but usually, it doesn\u2019t completely stop me from doing what I need to. It\u2019s more of a slow-down or distraction than something that fully interrupts my day.\nDoctor: Got it. Do you find yourself feeling worthless or guilty more often than not? Like blaming yourself for things or feeling like you\u2019re not measuring up?\nPatient: Not really. I don\u2019t often feel worthless or guilty. My sense of self hasn\u2019t changed much, even if the low energy and fatigue make things harder. Those kinds of feelings don\u2019t play a big role for me.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
