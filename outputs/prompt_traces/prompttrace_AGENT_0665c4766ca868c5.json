Higher symptom severity should show up as more impact on daily life, relationships, or goals. Lower severity should feel milder.\n- Keep trauma and serious adversity realistic and not universal. Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

It\u2019s not like every single moment, but enough that it\u2019s hard to just ignore. Sometimes I find it really tough to focus on schoolwork or even simple things, like my mind just kind of wanders, and it makes everything feel heavier. I also get pretty tired, even when I\u2019m getting enough rest. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up, but my energy just isn\u2019t there sometimes. I guess all of this just makes things feel more overwhelming than they probably should.\nDoctor: It sounds like that heaviness and trouble focusing are really wearing you down. How often are these feelings and the tiredness happening, and how much do they get in the way of your daily life?\nPatient: Honestly, it feels like the heaviness and fatigue are there almost every day. Some days it\u2019s worse, like I wake up already feeling drained, and just getting through the morning feels like a huge effort. Concentrating on anything, even the easiest assignments, becomes a migraine of to-do lists and random thoughts I can\u2019t shut off, so I end up taking twice as long or just giving up because it feels pointless. It\u2019s exhausting\u2014not just physically but mentally\u2014and that just makes me feel even more worthless, like I\u2019m failing at every little thing even when I\u2019m trying so hard. The constant tiredness drags down my motivation too, so it\u2019s this cycle that keeps repeating and I honestly don\u2019t see an end to it sometimes.\nDoctor: That cycle sounds incredibly tough and draining\u2014feeling worn out physically and mentally on top of everything else. Do you find yourself often feeling worthless or guilty in ways that feel more than what the situation would normally call for?\nPatient: Yes, definitely. I find myself overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness pretty much most days. Even when something small goes wrong or I don\u2019t meet some expectation, the guilt I feel feels way out of proportion\u2014like I\u2019m constantly beating myself up over things I shouldn\u2019t even be that upset about. It just piles on top of the fatigue and trouble concentrating, making everything feel ten times harder. When I feel that low, it\u2019s like my energy drains even faster and my mind just won\u2019t settle, which only makes the self-criticism worse. It becomes this vicious cycle where the more exhausted and scattered I feel, the more worthless and guilty I become, and then that drags me down even further. It\u2019s exhausting to live like that every day.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly exhausting\u2014to carry that kind of weight every day and feel stuck in a cycle that just keeps wearing you down.

I'd like to check in with you about a few things today.\nPatient: Hi. Um, I guess lately I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days. It\u2019s not like every single moment, but enough that it\u2019s hard to just ignore. Sometimes I find it really tough to focus on schoolwork or even simple things, like my mind just kind of wanders, and it makes everything feel heavier. I also get pretty tired, even when I\u2019m getting enough rest. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up, but my energy just isn\u2019t there sometimes. I guess all of this just makes things feel more overwhelming than they probably should.\nDoctor: It sounds like that heaviness and trouble focusing are really wearing you down. How often are these feelings and the tiredness happening, and how much do they get in the way of your daily life?\nPatient: Honestly, it feels like the heaviness and fatigue are there almost every day. Some days it\u2019s worse, like I wake up already feeling drained, and just getting through the morning feels like a huge effort. Concentrating on anything, even the easiest assignments, becomes a migraine of to-do lists and random thoughts I can\u2019t shut off, so I end up taking twice as long or just giving up because it feels pointless. It\u2019s exhausting\u2014not just physically but mentally\u2014and that just makes me feel even more worthless, like I\u2019m failing at every little thing even when I\u2019m trying so hard. The constant tiredness drags down my motivation too, so it\u2019s this cycle that keeps repeating and I honestly don\u2019t see an end to it sometimes.\nDoctor: That cycle sounds incredibly tough and draining\u2014feeling worn out physically and mentally on top of everything else. Do you find yourself often feeling worthless or guilty in ways that feel more than what the situation would normally call for?\nPatient: Yes, definitely. I find myself overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness pretty much most days. Even when something small goes wrong or I don\u2019t meet some expectation, the guilt I feel feels way out of proportion\u2014like I\u2019m constantly beating myself up over things I shouldn\u2019t even be that upset about. It just piles on top of the fatigue and trouble concentrating, making everything feel ten times harder. When I feel that low, it\u2019s like my energy drains even faster and my mind just won\u2019t settle, which only makes the self-criticism worse. It becomes this vicious cycle where the more exhausted and scattered I feel, the more worthless and guilty I become, and then that drags me down even further. It\u2019s exhausting to live like that every day.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly exhausting\u2014to carry that kind of weight every day and feel stuck in a cycle that just keeps wearing you down. I hear how heavy it all feels for you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s really overwhelming. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m just sinking deeper into this endless exhaustion that doesn\u2019t let up, no matter what I do. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught in this relentless cycle where the heaviness just smothers any motivation or hope I might have. I want to push through, but the weight of all these thoughts and feelings drags me back every time. The self-criticism feels like this constant noise in my head, making it impossible to find even a moment of peace. It\u2019s like I\u2019m trapped inside my own mind, and that exhaustion isn\u2019t just physical\u2014it\u2019s this deep emotional drain that just wears me down more and more each day. I don\u2019t know how to break out of it, and that\u2019s the hardest part.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, constant exhaustion takes a real toll. Can you tell me about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: Actually, I don\u2019t usually have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep during the night.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

I'd like to check in with you about a few things today.\nPatient: Hi. Um, I guess lately I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days. It\u2019s not like every single moment, but enough that it\u2019s hard to just ignore. Sometimes I find it really tough to focus on schoolwork or even simple things, like my mind just kind of wanders, and it makes everything feel heavier. I also get pretty tired, even when I\u2019m getting enough rest. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up, but my energy just isn\u2019t there sometimes. I guess all of this just makes things feel more overwhelming than they probably should.\nDoctor: It sounds like that heaviness and trouble focusing are really wearing you down. How often are these feelings and the tiredness happening, and how much do they get in the way of your daily life?\nPatient: Honestly, it feels like the heaviness and fatigue are there almost every day. Some days it\u2019s worse, like I wake up already feeling drained, and just getting through the morning feels like a huge effort. Concentrating on anything, even the easiest assignments, becomes a migraine of to-do lists and random thoughts I can\u2019t shut off, so I end up taking twice as long or just giving up because it feels pointless. It\u2019s exhausting\u2014not just physically but mentally\u2014and that just makes me feel even more worthless, like I\u2019m failing at every little thing even when I\u2019m trying so hard. The constant tiredness drags down my motivation too, so it\u2019s this cycle that keeps repeating and I honestly don\u2019t see an end to it sometimes.\nDoctor: That cycle sounds incredibly tough and draining\u2014feeling worn out physically and mentally on top of everything else. Do you find yourself often feeling worthless or guilty in ways that feel more than what the situation would normally call for?\nPatient: Yes, definitely. I find myself overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness pretty much most days. Even when something small goes wrong or I don\u2019t meet some expectation, the guilt I feel feels way out of proportion\u2014like I\u2019m constantly beating myself up over things I shouldn\u2019t even be that upset about. It just piles on top of the fatigue and trouble concentrating, making everything feel ten times harder. When I feel that low, it\u2019s like my energy drains even faster and my mind just won\u2019t settle, which only makes the self-criticism worse. It becomes this vicious cycle where the more exhausted and scattered I feel, the more worthless and guilty I become, and then that drags me down even further. It\u2019s exhausting to live like that every day.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly exhausting\u2014to carry that kind of weight every day and feel stuck in a cycle that just keeps wearing you down. I hear how heavy it all feels for you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s really overwhelming. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m just sinking deeper into this endless exhaustion that doesn\u2019t let up, no matter what I do. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught in this relentless cycle where the heaviness just smothers any motivation or hope I might have. I want to push through, but the weight of all these thoughts and feelings drags me back every time. The self-criticism feels like this constant noise in my head, making it impossible to find even a moment of peace. It\u2019s like I\u2019m trapped inside my own mind, and that exhaustion isn\u2019t just physical\u2014it\u2019s this deep emotional drain that just wears me down more and more each day. I don\u2019t know how to break out of it, and that\u2019s the hardest part.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, constant exhaustion takes a real toll. Can you tell me about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: Actually, I don\u2019t usually have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep during the night. But even when I get a full night\u2019s rest, I still wake up feeling tired\u2014like the rest didn\u2019t really refresh me at all. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s not just about sleep quality; the tiredness feels deeper and more persistent than that, like it\u2019s part of the heaviness I carry during the day. So even though my sleep seems okay, the fatigue sticks around and makes everything else harder.\nDoctor: It sounds like the fatigue runs deeper than just sleep issues and is a constant weight you carry.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

I'd like to check in with you about a few things today.\nPatient: Hi. Um, I guess lately I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days. It\u2019s not like every single moment, but enough that it\u2019s hard to just ignore. Sometimes I find it really tough to focus on schoolwork or even simple things, like my mind just kind of wanders, and it makes everything feel heavier. I also get pretty tired, even when I\u2019m getting enough rest. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up, but my energy just isn\u2019t there sometimes. I guess all of this just makes things feel more overwhelming than they probably should.\nDoctor: It sounds like that heaviness and trouble focusing are really wearing you down. How often are these feelings and the tiredness happening, and how much do they get in the way of your daily life?\nPatient: Honestly, it feels like the heaviness and fatigue are there almost every day. Some days it\u2019s worse, like I wake up already feeling drained, and just getting through the morning feels like a huge effort. Concentrating on anything, even the easiest assignments, becomes a migraine of to-do lists and random thoughts I can\u2019t shut off, so I end up taking twice as long or just giving up because it feels pointless. It\u2019s exhausting\u2014not just physically but mentally\u2014and that just makes me feel even more worthless, like I\u2019m failing at every little thing even when I\u2019m trying so hard. The constant tiredness drags down my motivation too, so it\u2019s this cycle that keeps repeating and I honestly don\u2019t see an end to it sometimes.\nDoctor: That cycle sounds incredibly tough and draining\u2014feeling worn out physically and mentally on top of everything else. Do you find yourself often feeling worthless or guilty in ways that feel more than what the situation would normally call for?\nPatient: Yes, definitely. I find myself overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness pretty much most days. Even when something small goes wrong or I don\u2019t meet some expectation, the guilt I feel feels way out of proportion\u2014like I\u2019m constantly beating myself up over things I shouldn\u2019t even be that upset about. It just piles on top of the fatigue and trouble concentrating, making everything feel ten times harder. When I feel that low, it\u2019s like my energy drains even faster and my mind just won\u2019t settle, which only makes the self-criticism worse. It becomes this vicious cycle where the more exhausted and scattered I feel, the more worthless and guilty I become, and then that drags me down even further. It\u2019s exhausting to live like that every day.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly exhausting\u2014to carry that kind of weight every day and feel stuck in a cycle that just keeps wearing you down. I hear how heavy it all feels for you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s really overwhelming. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m just sinking deeper into this endless exhaustion that doesn\u2019t let up, no matter what I do. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught in this relentless cycle where the heaviness just smothers any motivation or hope I might have. I want to push through, but the weight of all these thoughts and feelings drags me back every time. The self-criticism feels like this constant noise in my head, making it impossible to find even a moment of peace. It\u2019s like I\u2019m trapped inside my own mind, and that exhaustion isn\u2019t just physical\u2014it\u2019s this deep emotional drain that just wears me down more and more each day. I don\u2019t know how to break out of it, and that\u2019s the hardest part.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, constant exhaustion takes a real toll. Can you tell me about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: Actually, I don\u2019t usually have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep during the night. But even when I get a full night\u2019s rest, I still wake up feeling tired\u2014like the rest didn\u2019t really refresh me at all. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s not just about sleep quality; the tiredness feels deeper and more persistent than that, like it\u2019s part of the heaviness I carry during the day. So even though my sleep seems okay, the fatigue sticks around and makes everything else harder.\nDoctor: It sounds like the fatigue runs deeper than just sleep issues and is a constant weight you carry. How does this fatigue affect your daily activities, and do you notice if it gets worse as the day goes on or stays about the same?\nPatient: The fatigue really takes a huge toll on everything I try to do throughout the day. In the morning, I might manage okay, but as the hours pass, I feel myself getting more and more drained\u2014mentally and physically. By the afternoon, even simple things like paying attention in class or completing homework feel overwhelming and exhausting. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this weight pressing down on me that just never lets up, and it gets heavier the longer I\u2019m awake and active.

I don\u2019t know how to break out of it, and that\u2019s the hardest part.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, constant exhaustion takes a real toll. Can you tell me about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: Actually, I don\u2019t usually have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep during the night. But even when I get a full night\u2019s rest, I still wake up feeling tired\u2014like the rest didn\u2019t really refresh me at all. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s not just about sleep quality; the tiredness feels deeper and more persistent than that, like it\u2019s part of the heaviness I carry during the day. So even though my sleep seems okay, the fatigue sticks around and makes everything else harder.\nDoctor: It sounds like the fatigue runs deeper than just sleep issues and is a constant weight you carry. How does this fatigue affect your daily activities, and do you notice if it gets worse as the day goes on or stays about the same?\nPatient: The fatigue really takes a huge toll on everything I try to do throughout the day. In the morning, I might manage okay, but as the hours pass, I feel myself getting more and more drained\u2014mentally and physically. By the afternoon, even simple things like paying attention in class or completing homework feel overwhelming and exhausting. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this weight pressing down on me that just never lets up, and it gets heavier the longer I\u2019m awake and active. By evening, I\u2019m often just too worn down to do much more than sit quietly, because my energy is almost completely gone. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up and be productive, but my body and mind just won\u2019t cooperate, and that makes everything feel even harder.\nDoctor: That kind of draining energy building up over the day must feel really heavy. Have you noticed if the things you used to enjoy or look forward to doing feel less interesting or satisfying lately?\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t really lost interest in the things I used to enjoy. Drawing, for example, still feels important to me, and when I\u2019m able to do it, it provides some relief. But even with that, the fatigue and mental heaviness make it harder to get started or stay focused for long. So my feelings toward those activities haven\u2019t changed much, but my energy and motivation to do them are definitely worn down by everything else going on. It\u2019s like the desire is still there, but my body and mind just can\u2019t always keep up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that drawing still holds some meaning for you, even with everything else going on. How often do you actually get the chance to draw or do other activities you care about, and what tends to make it easier or harder for you to start or keep going when you try?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nIt\u2019s good that drawing still holds some meaning for you, even with everything else going on.

I'd like to check in with you about a few things today.\nPatient: Hi. Um, I guess lately I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days. It\u2019s not like every single moment, but enough that it\u2019s hard to just ignore. Sometimes I find it really tough to focus on schoolwork or even simple things, like my mind just kind of wanders, and it makes everything feel heavier. I also get pretty tired, even when I\u2019m getting enough rest. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up, but my energy just isn\u2019t there sometimes. I guess all of this just makes things feel more overwhelming than they probably should.\nDoctor: It sounds like that heaviness and trouble focusing are really wearing you down. How often are these feelings and the tiredness happening, and how much do they get in the way of your daily life?\nPatient: Honestly, it feels like the heaviness and fatigue are there almost every day. Some days it\u2019s worse, like I wake up already feeling drained, and just getting through the morning feels like a huge effort. Concentrating on anything, even the easiest assignments, becomes a migraine of to-do lists and random thoughts I can\u2019t shut off, so I end up taking twice as long or just giving up because it feels pointless. It\u2019s exhausting\u2014not just physically but mentally\u2014and that just makes me feel even more worthless, like I\u2019m failing at every little thing even when I\u2019m trying so hard. The constant tiredness drags down my motivation too, so it\u2019s this cycle that keeps repeating and I honestly don\u2019t see an end to it sometimes.\nDoctor: That cycle sounds incredibly tough and draining\u2014feeling worn out physically and mentally on top of everything else. Do you find yourself often feeling worthless or guilty in ways that feel more than what the situation would normally call for?\nPatient: Yes, definitely. I find myself overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness pretty much most days. Even when something small goes wrong or I don\u2019t meet some expectation, the guilt I feel feels way out of proportion\u2014like I\u2019m constantly beating myself up over things I shouldn\u2019t even be that upset about. It just piles on top of the fatigue and trouble concentrating, making everything feel ten times harder. When I feel that low, it\u2019s like my energy drains even faster and my mind just won\u2019t settle, which only makes the self-criticism worse. It becomes this vicious cycle where the more exhausted and scattered I feel, the more worthless and guilty I become, and then that drags me down even further. It\u2019s exhausting to live like that every day.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly exhausting\u2014to carry that kind of weight every day and feel stuck in a cycle that just keeps wearing you down. I hear how heavy it all feels for you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s really overwhelming. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m just sinking deeper into this endless exhaustion that doesn\u2019t let up, no matter what I do. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught in this relentless cycle where the heaviness just smothers any motivation or hope I might have. I want to push through, but the weight of all these thoughts and feelings drags me back every time. The self-criticism feels like this constant noise in my head, making it impossible to find even a moment of peace. It\u2019s like I\u2019m trapped inside my own mind, and that exhaustion isn\u2019t just physical\u2014it\u2019s this deep emotional drain that just wears me down more and more each day. I don\u2019t know how to break out of it, and that\u2019s the hardest part.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, constant exhaustion takes a real toll. Can you tell me about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: Actually, I don\u2019t usually have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep during the night. But even when I get a full night\u2019s rest, I still wake up feeling tired\u2014like the rest didn\u2019t really refresh me at all.

I also get pretty tired, even when I\u2019m getting enough rest. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up, but my energy just isn\u2019t there sometimes. I guess all of this just makes things feel more overwhelming than they probably should.\nDoctor: It sounds like that heaviness and trouble focusing are really wearing you down. How often are these feelings and the tiredness happening, and how much do they get in the way of your daily life?\nPatient: Honestly, it feels like the heaviness and fatigue are there almost every day. Some days it\u2019s worse, like I wake up already feeling drained, and just getting through the morning feels like a huge effort. Concentrating on anything, even the easiest assignments, becomes a migraine of to-do lists and random thoughts I can\u2019t shut off, so I end up taking twice as long or just giving up because it feels pointless. It\u2019s exhausting\u2014not just physically but mentally\u2014and that just makes me feel even more worthless, like I\u2019m failing at every little thing even when I\u2019m trying so hard. The constant tiredness drags down my motivation too, so it\u2019s this cycle that keeps repeating and I honestly don\u2019t see an end to it sometimes.\nDoctor: That cycle sounds incredibly tough and draining\u2014feeling worn out physically and mentally on top of everything else. Do you find yourself often feeling worthless or guilty in ways that feel more than what the situation would normally call for?\nPatient: Yes, definitely. I find myself overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness pretty much most days. Even when something small goes wrong or I don\u2019t meet some expectation, the guilt I feel feels way out of proportion\u2014like I\u2019m constantly beating myself up over things I shouldn\u2019t even be that upset about. It just piles on top of the fatigue and trouble concentrating, making everything feel ten times harder. When I feel that low, it\u2019s like my energy drains even faster and my mind just won\u2019t settle, which only makes the self-criticism worse. It becomes this vicious cycle where the more exhausted and scattered I feel, the more worthless and guilty I become, and then that drags me down even further. It\u2019s exhausting to live like that every day.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly exhausting\u2014to carry that kind of weight every day and feel stuck in a cycle that just keeps wearing you down. I hear how heavy it all feels for you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s really overwhelming. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m just sinking deeper into this endless exhaustion that doesn\u2019t let up, no matter what I do. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught in this relentless cycle where the heaviness just smothers any motivation or hope I might have. I want to push through, but the weight of all these thoughts and feelings drags me back every time. The self-criticism feels like this constant noise in my head, making it impossible to find even a moment of peace. It\u2019s like I\u2019m trapped inside my own mind, and that exhaustion isn\u2019t just physical\u2014it\u2019s this deep emotional drain that just wears me down more and more each day. I don\u2019t know how to break out of it, and that\u2019s the hardest part.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, constant exhaustion takes a real toll. Can you tell me about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: Actually, I don\u2019t usually have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep during the night. But even when I get a full night\u2019s rest, I still wake up feeling tired\u2014like the rest didn\u2019t really refresh me at all. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s not just about sleep quality; the tiredness feels deeper and more persistent than that, like it\u2019s part of the heaviness I carry during the day. So even though my sleep seems okay, the fatigue sticks around and makes everything else harder.\nDoctor: It sounds like the fatigue runs deeper than just sleep issues and is a constant weight you carry. How does this fatigue affect your daily activities, and do you notice if it gets worse as the day goes on or stays about the same?\nPatient: The fatigue really takes a huge toll on everything I try to do throughout the day. In the morning, I might manage okay, but as the hours pass, I feel myself getting more and more drained\u2014mentally and physically. By the afternoon, even simple things like paying attention in class or completing homework feel overwhelming and exhausting. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this weight pressing down on me that just never lets up, and it gets heavier the longer I\u2019m awake and active. By evening, I\u2019m often just too worn down to do much more than sit quietly, because my energy is almost completely gone. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up and be productive, but my body and mind just won\u2019t cooperate, and that makes everything feel even harder.\nDoctor: That kind of draining energy building up over the day must feel really heavy. Have you noticed if the things you used to enjoy or look forward to doing feel less interesting or satisfying lately?\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t really lost interest in the things I used to enjoy. Drawing, for example, still feels important to me, and when I\u2019m able to do it, it provides some relief. But even with that, the fatigue and mental heaviness make it harder to get started or stay focused for long. So my feelings toward those activities haven\u2019t changed much, but my energy and motivation to do them are definitely worn down by everything else going on. It\u2019s like the desire is still there, but my body and mind just can\u2019t always keep up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that drawing still holds some meaning for you, even with everything else going on. How often do you actually get the chance to draw or do other activities you care about, and what tends to make it easier or harder for you to start or keep going when you try?\nPatient: I guess I draw less often than I used to, mostly because the fatigue and mental heaviness sometimes make it really hard to get started or to keep going once I do. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a block in my mind that holds me back from focusing or feeling inspired. Sometimes taking small breaks or just sitting in a quiet space helps me gather enough energy or calm my thoughts enough to try drawing, but that doesn\u2019t happen very often. Most of the time, it feels like I\u2019m stuck in this fog that makes even the things I care about feel out of reach.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing sounds really hard to break through. To get a fuller picture, I want to ask about your appetite and weight\u2014have you noticed any changes in how much you\u2019re eating or in your weight recently?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat fog you\u2019re describing sounds really hard to break through.

I'd like to check in with you about a few things today.\nPatient: Hi. Um, I guess lately I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days. It\u2019s not like every single moment, but enough that it\u2019s hard to just ignore. Sometimes I find it really tough to focus on schoolwork or even simple things, like my mind just kind of wanders, and it makes everything feel heavier. I also get pretty tired, even when I\u2019m getting enough rest. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up, but my energy just isn\u2019t there sometimes. I guess all of this just makes things feel more overwhelming than they probably should.\nDoctor: It sounds like that heaviness and trouble focusing are really wearing you down. How often are these feelings and the tiredness happening, and how much do they get in the way of your daily life?\nPatient: Honestly, it feels like the heaviness and fatigue are there almost every day. Some days it\u2019s worse, like I wake up already feeling drained, and just getting through the morning feels like a huge effort. Concentrating on anything, even the easiest assignments, becomes a migraine of to-do lists and random thoughts I can\u2019t shut off, so I end up taking twice as long or just giving up because it feels pointless. It\u2019s exhausting\u2014not just physically but mentally\u2014and that just makes me feel even more worthless, like I\u2019m failing at every little thing even when I\u2019m trying so hard. The constant tiredness drags down my motivation too, so it\u2019s this cycle that keeps repeating and I honestly don\u2019t see an end to it sometimes.\nDoctor: That cycle sounds incredibly tough and draining\u2014feeling worn out physically and mentally on top of everything else. Do you find yourself often feeling worthless or guilty in ways that feel more than what the situation would normally call for?\nPatient: Yes, definitely. I find myself overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness pretty much most days. Even when something small goes wrong or I don\u2019t meet some expectation, the guilt I feel feels way out of proportion\u2014like I\u2019m constantly beating myself up over things I shouldn\u2019t even be that upset about. It just piles on top of the fatigue and trouble concentrating, making everything feel ten times harder. When I feel that low, it\u2019s like my energy drains even faster and my mind just won\u2019t settle, which only makes the self-criticism worse. It becomes this vicious cycle where the more exhausted and scattered I feel, the more worthless and guilty I become, and then that drags me down even further. It\u2019s exhausting to live like that every day.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly exhausting\u2014to carry that kind of weight every day and feel stuck in a cycle that just keeps wearing you down. I hear how heavy it all feels for you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s really overwhelming. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m just sinking deeper into this endless exhaustion that doesn\u2019t let up, no matter what I do. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught in this relentless cycle where the heaviness just smothers any motivation or hope I might have. I want to push through, but the weight of all these thoughts and feelings drags me back every time. The self-criticism feels like this constant noise in my head, making it impossible to find even a moment of peace. It\u2019s like I\u2019m trapped inside my own mind, and that exhaustion isn\u2019t just physical\u2014it\u2019s this deep emotional drain that just wears me down more and more each day. I don\u2019t know how to break out of it, and that\u2019s the hardest part.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, constant exhaustion takes a real toll. Can you tell me about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: Actually, I don\u2019t usually have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep during the night. But even when I get a full night\u2019s rest, I still wake up feeling tired\u2014like the rest didn\u2019t really refresh me at all. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s not just about sleep quality; the tiredness feels deeper and more persistent than that, like it\u2019s part of the heaviness I carry during the day. So even though my sleep seems okay, the fatigue sticks around and makes everything else harder.\nDoctor: It sounds like the fatigue runs deeper than just sleep issues and is a constant weight you carry. How does this fatigue affect your daily activities, and do you notice if it gets worse as the day goes on or stays about the same?\nPatient: The fatigue really takes a huge toll on everything I try to do throughout the day. In the morning, I might manage okay, but as the hours pass, I feel myself getting more and more drained\u2014mentally and physically. By the afternoon, even simple things like paying attention in class or completing homework feel overwhelming and exhausting. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this weight pressing down on me that just never lets up, and it gets heavier the longer I\u2019m awake and active. By evening, I\u2019m often just too worn down to do much more than sit quietly, because my energy is almost completely gone. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up and be productive, but my body and mind just won\u2019t cooperate, and that makes everything feel even harder.\nDoctor: That kind of draining energy building up over the day must feel really heavy. Have you noticed if the things you used to enjoy or look forward to doing feel less interesting or satisfying lately?\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t really lost interest in the things I used to enjoy. Drawing, for example, still feels important to me, and when I\u2019m able to do it, it provides some relief. But even with that, the fatigue and mental heaviness make it harder to get started or stay focused for long. So my feelings toward those activities haven\u2019t changed much, but my energy and motivation to do them are definitely worn down by everything else going on. It\u2019s like the desire is still there, but my body and mind just can\u2019t always keep up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that drawing still holds some meaning for you, even with everything else going on. How often do you actually get the chance to draw or do other activities you care about, and what tends to make it easier or harder for you to start or keep going when you try?\nPatient: I guess I draw less often than I used to, mostly because the fatigue and mental heaviness sometimes make it really hard to get started or to keep going once I do. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a block in my mind that holds me back from focusing or feeling inspired. Sometimes taking small breaks or just sitting in a quiet space helps me gather enough energy or calm my thoughts enough to try drawing, but that doesn\u2019t happen very often. Most of the time, it feels like I\u2019m stuck in this fog that makes even the things I care about feel out of reach.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing sounds really hard to break through. To get a fuller picture, I want to ask about your appetite and weight\u2014have you noticed any changes in how much you\u2019re eating or in your weight recently?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t really noticed much change in my appetite or weight. I eat about the same as I always have, but the fatigue and mental fog just keep lingering no matter what. So it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s connected to anything with eating\u2014those feelings just stick around on their own. It\u2019s frustrating because even though my habits are pretty steady, the heaviness in my mind and body doesn\u2019t go away.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. Now, how would you describe your overall mood most days\u2014do you find yourself feeling sad or down beyond the heaviness we\u2019ve talked about?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThanks for sharing that.

I'd like to check in with you about a few things today.\nPatient: Hi. Um, I guess lately I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days. It\u2019s not like every single moment, but enough that it\u2019s hard to just ignore. Sometimes I find it really tough to focus on schoolwork or even simple things, like my mind just kind of wanders, and it makes everything feel heavier. I also get pretty tired, even when I\u2019m getting enough rest. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up, but my energy just isn\u2019t there sometimes. I guess all of this just makes things feel more overwhelming than they probably should.\nDoctor: It sounds like that heaviness and trouble focusing are really wearing you down. How often are these feelings and the tiredness happening, and how much do they get in the way of your daily life?\nPatient: Honestly, it feels like the heaviness and fatigue are there almost every day. Some days it\u2019s worse, like I wake up already feeling drained, and just getting through the morning feels like a huge effort. Concentrating on anything, even the easiest assignments, becomes a migraine of to-do lists and random thoughts I can\u2019t shut off, so I end up taking twice as long or just giving up because it feels pointless. It\u2019s exhausting\u2014not just physically but mentally\u2014and that just makes me feel even more worthless, like I\u2019m failing at every little thing even when I\u2019m trying so hard. The constant tiredness drags down my motivation too, so it\u2019s this cycle that keeps repeating and I honestly don\u2019t see an end to it sometimes.\nDoctor: That cycle sounds incredibly tough and draining\u2014feeling worn out physically and mentally on top of everything else. Do you find yourself often feeling worthless or guilty in ways that feel more than what the situation would normally call for?\nPatient: Yes, definitely. I find myself overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness pretty much most days. Even when something small goes wrong or I don\u2019t meet some expectation, the guilt I feel feels way out of proportion\u2014like I\u2019m constantly beating myself up over things I shouldn\u2019t even be that upset about. It just piles on top of the fatigue and trouble concentrating, making everything feel ten times harder. When I feel that low, it\u2019s like my energy drains even faster and my mind just won\u2019t settle, which only makes the self-criticism worse. It becomes this vicious cycle where the more exhausted and scattered I feel, the more worthless and guilty I become, and then that drags me down even further. It\u2019s exhausting to live like that every day.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly exhausting\u2014to carry that kind of weight every day and feel stuck in a cycle that just keeps wearing you down. I hear how heavy it all feels for you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s really overwhelming. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m just sinking deeper into this endless exhaustion that doesn\u2019t let up, no matter what I do. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught in this relentless cycle where the heaviness just smothers any motivation or hope I might have. I want to push through, but the weight of all these thoughts and feelings drags me back every time. The self-criticism feels like this constant noise in my head, making it impossible to find even a moment of peace. It\u2019s like I\u2019m trapped inside my own mind, and that exhaustion isn\u2019t just physical\u2014it\u2019s this deep emotional drain that just wears me down more and more each day. I don\u2019t know how to break out of it, and that\u2019s the hardest part.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, constant exhaustion takes a real toll. Can you tell me about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: Actually, I don\u2019t usually have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep during the night. But even when I get a full night\u2019s rest, I still wake up feeling tired\u2014like the rest didn\u2019t really refresh me at all. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s not just about sleep quality; the tiredness feels deeper and more persistent than that, like it\u2019s part of the heaviness I carry during the day. So even though my sleep seems okay, the fatigue sticks around and makes everything else harder.\nDoctor: It sounds like the fatigue runs deeper than just sleep issues and is a constant weight you carry. How does this fatigue affect your daily activities, and do you notice if it gets worse as the day goes on or stays about the same?\nPatient: The fatigue really takes a huge toll on everything I try to do throughout the day. In the morning, I might manage okay, but as the hours pass, I feel myself getting more and more drained\u2014mentally and physically. By the afternoon, even simple things like paying attention in class or completing homework feel overwhelming and exhausting. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this weight pressing down on me that just never lets up, and it gets heavier the longer I\u2019m awake and active. By evening, I\u2019m often just too worn down to do much more than sit quietly, because my energy is almost completely gone. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up and be productive, but my body and mind just won\u2019t cooperate, and that makes everything feel even harder.\nDoctor: That kind of draining energy building up over the day must feel really heavy. Have you noticed if the things you used to enjoy or look forward to doing feel less interesting or satisfying lately?\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t really lost interest in the things I used to enjoy. Drawing, for example, still feels important to me, and when I\u2019m able to do it, it provides some relief. But even with that, the fatigue and mental heaviness make it harder to get started or stay focused for long. So my feelings toward those activities haven\u2019t changed much, but my energy and motivation to do them are definitely worn down by everything else going on. It\u2019s like the desire is still there, but my body and mind just can\u2019t always keep up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that drawing still holds some meaning for you, even with everything else going on. How often do you actually get the chance to draw or do other activities you care about, and what tends to make it easier or harder for you to start or keep going when you try?\nPatient: I guess I draw less often than I used to, mostly because the fatigue and mental heaviness sometimes make it really hard to get started or to keep going once I do. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a block in my mind that holds me back from focusing or feeling inspired. Sometimes taking small breaks or just sitting in a quiet space helps me gather enough energy or calm my thoughts enough to try drawing, but that doesn\u2019t happen very often. Most of the time, it feels like I\u2019m stuck in this fog that makes even the things I care about feel out of reach.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing sounds really hard to break through. To get a fuller picture, I want to ask about your appetite and weight\u2014have you noticed any changes in how much you\u2019re eating or in your weight recently?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t really noticed much change in my appetite or weight. I eat about the same as I always have, but the fatigue and mental fog just keep lingering no matter what. So it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s connected to anything with eating\u2014those feelings just stick around on their own. It\u2019s frustrating because even though my habits are pretty steady, the heaviness in my mind and body doesn\u2019t go away.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. Now, how would you describe your overall mood most days\u2014do you find yourself feeling sad or down beyond the heaviness we\u2019ve talked about?\nPatient: Yes, I do feel sad or down on most days, and it\u2019s more intense than just feeling heavy or tired. It\u2019s this deep sadness that weighs on me and colors how I see everything\u2014like it makes even small challenges feel enormous and sometimes feels almost overwhelming. That sadness affects my mindset a lot, making it harder to stay hopeful or focused, and it adds to the exhaustion I already feel. It\u2019s like carrying this emotional weight on top of the mental and physical fatigue, and honestly, it wears me out just as much, if not more.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, persistent sadness sounds really heavy to carry alongside everything else.

It\u2019s not like every single moment, but enough that it\u2019s hard to just ignore. Sometimes I find it really tough to focus on schoolwork or even simple things, like my mind just kind of wanders, and it makes everything feel heavier. I also get pretty tired, even when I\u2019m getting enough rest. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up, but my energy just isn\u2019t there sometimes. I guess all of this just makes things feel more overwhelming than they probably should.\nDoctor: It sounds like that heaviness and trouble focusing are really wearing you down. How often are these feelings and the tiredness happening, and how much do they get in the way of your daily life?\nPatient: Honestly, it feels like the heaviness and fatigue are there almost every day. Some days it\u2019s worse, like I wake up already feeling drained, and just getting through the morning feels like a huge effort. Concentrating on anything, even the easiest assignments, becomes a migraine of to-do lists and random thoughts I can\u2019t shut off, so I end up taking twice as long or just giving up because it feels pointless. It\u2019s exhausting\u2014not just physically but mentally\u2014and that just makes me feel even more worthless, like I\u2019m failing at every little thing even when I\u2019m trying so hard. The constant tiredness drags down my motivation too, so it\u2019s this cycle that keeps repeating and I honestly don\u2019t see an end to it sometimes.\nDoctor: That cycle sounds incredibly tough and draining\u2014feeling worn out physically and mentally on top of everything else. Do you find yourself often feeling worthless or guilty in ways that feel more than what the situation would normally call for?\nPatient: Yes, definitely. I find myself overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness pretty much most days. Even when something small goes wrong or I don\u2019t meet some expectation, the guilt I feel feels way out of proportion\u2014like I\u2019m constantly beating myself up over things I shouldn\u2019t even be that upset about. It just piles on top of the fatigue and trouble concentrating, making everything feel ten times harder. When I feel that low, it\u2019s like my energy drains even faster and my mind just won\u2019t settle, which only makes the self-criticism worse. It becomes this vicious cycle where the more exhausted and scattered I feel, the more worthless and guilty I become, and then that drags me down even further. It\u2019s exhausting to live like that every day.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly exhausting\u2014to carry that kind of weight every day and feel stuck in a cycle that just keeps wearing you down. I hear how heavy it all feels for you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s really overwhelming. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m just sinking deeper into this endless exhaustion that doesn\u2019t let up, no matter what I do. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught in this relentless cycle where the heaviness just smothers any motivation or hope I might have. I want to push through, but the weight of all these thoughts and feelings drags me back every time. The self-criticism feels like this constant noise in my head, making it impossible to find even a moment of peace. It\u2019s like I\u2019m trapped inside my own mind, and that exhaustion isn\u2019t just physical\u2014it\u2019s this deep emotional drain that just wears me down more and more each day. I don\u2019t know how to break out of it, and that\u2019s the hardest part.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, constant exhaustion takes a real toll. Can you tell me about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: Actually, I don\u2019t usually have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep during the night. But even when I get a full night\u2019s rest, I still wake up feeling tired\u2014like the rest didn\u2019t really refresh me at all. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s not just about sleep quality; the tiredness feels deeper and more persistent than that, like it\u2019s part of the heaviness I carry during the day. So even though my sleep seems okay, the fatigue sticks around and makes everything else harder.\nDoctor: It sounds like the fatigue runs deeper than just sleep issues and is a constant weight you carry. How does this fatigue affect your daily activities, and do you notice if it gets worse as the day goes on or stays about the same?\nPatient: The fatigue really takes a huge toll on everything I try to do throughout the day. In the morning, I might manage okay, but as the hours pass, I feel myself getting more and more drained\u2014mentally and physically. By the afternoon, even simple things like paying attention in class or completing homework feel overwhelming and exhausting. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this weight pressing down on me that just never lets up, and it gets heavier the longer I\u2019m awake and active. By evening, I\u2019m often just too worn down to do much more than sit quietly, because my energy is almost completely gone. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up and be productive, but my body and mind just won\u2019t cooperate, and that makes everything feel even harder.\nDoctor: That kind of draining energy building up over the day must feel really heavy. Have you noticed if the things you used to enjoy or look forward to doing feel less interesting or satisfying lately?\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t really lost interest in the things I used to enjoy. Drawing, for example, still feels important to me, and when I\u2019m able to do it, it provides some relief. But even with that, the fatigue and mental heaviness make it harder to get started or stay focused for long. So my feelings toward those activities haven\u2019t changed much, but my energy and motivation to do them are definitely worn down by everything else going on. It\u2019s like the desire is still there, but my body and mind just can\u2019t always keep up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that drawing still holds some meaning for you, even with everything else going on. How often do you actually get the chance to draw or do other activities you care about, and what tends to make it easier or harder for you to start or keep going when you try?\nPatient: I guess I draw less often than I used to, mostly because the fatigue and mental heaviness sometimes make it really hard to get started or to keep going once I do. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a block in my mind that holds me back from focusing or feeling inspired. Sometimes taking small breaks or just sitting in a quiet space helps me gather enough energy or calm my thoughts enough to try drawing, but that doesn\u2019t happen very often. Most of the time, it feels like I\u2019m stuck in this fog that makes even the things I care about feel out of reach.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing sounds really hard to break through. To get a fuller picture, I want to ask about your appetite and weight\u2014have you noticed any changes in how much you\u2019re eating or in your weight recently?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t really noticed much change in my appetite or weight. I eat about the same as I always have, but the fatigue and mental fog just keep lingering no matter what. So it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s connected to anything with eating\u2014those feelings just stick around on their own. It\u2019s frustrating because even though my habits are pretty steady, the heaviness in my mind and body doesn\u2019t go away.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. Now, how would you describe your overall mood most days\u2014do you find yourself feeling sad or down beyond the heaviness we\u2019ve talked about?\nPatient: Yes, I do feel sad or down on most days, and it\u2019s more intense than just feeling heavy or tired. It\u2019s this deep sadness that weighs on me and colors how I see everything\u2014like it makes even small challenges feel enormous and sometimes feels almost overwhelming. That sadness affects my mindset a lot, making it harder to stay hopeful or focused, and it adds to the exhaustion I already feel. It\u2019s like carrying this emotional weight on top of the mental and physical fatigue, and honestly, it wears me out just as much, if not more.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, persistent sadness sounds really heavy to carry alongside everything else. How long have you been feeling this way, and how does it affect your daily life or the way you get through your days?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been carrying this sadness and heaviness for several months now, maybe even longer. It\u2019s not just something that comes and goes\u2014it feels like it\u2019s always there, like a weight I can\u2019t shake off. Every day feels like this continuous struggle where even simple tasks require so much effort just to start or keep going. It makes me feel stuck, like I\u2019m trying to push through quicksand but sinking deeper instead. The sadness and fatigue build on each other, making it harder to find the energy or motivation to do things I want to do, even when I know they might help. I\u2019ve tried to manage it in different ways, but often it just feels overwhelming, like I\u2019m trapped in this cycle with no clear way out. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that\u2019s hard to put into words because it\u2019s not just physical tiredness\u2014it\u2019s this all-consuming emotional and mental drain that carries through every moment.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nI\u2019ve been carrying this sadness and heaviness for several months now, maybe even longer.

I'd like to check in with you about a few things today.\nPatient: Hi. Um, I guess lately I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days. It\u2019s not like every single moment, but enough that it\u2019s hard to just ignore. Sometimes I find it really tough to focus on schoolwork or even simple things, like my mind just kind of wanders, and it makes everything feel heavier. I also get pretty tired, even when I\u2019m getting enough rest. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up, but my energy just isn\u2019t there sometimes. I guess all of this just makes things feel more overwhelming than they probably should.\nDoctor: It sounds like that heaviness and trouble focusing are really wearing you down. How often are these feelings and the tiredness happening, and how much do they get in the way of your daily life?\nPatient: Honestly, it feels like the heaviness and fatigue are there almost every day. Some days it\u2019s worse, like I wake up already feeling drained, and just getting through the morning feels like a huge effort. Concentrating on anything, even the easiest assignments, becomes a migraine of to-do lists and random thoughts I can\u2019t shut off, so I end up taking twice as long or just giving up because it feels pointless. It\u2019s exhausting\u2014not just physically but mentally\u2014and that just makes me feel even more worthless, like I\u2019m failing at every little thing even when I\u2019m trying so hard. The constant tiredness drags down my motivation too, so it\u2019s this cycle that keeps repeating and I honestly don\u2019t see an end to it sometimes.\nDoctor: That cycle sounds incredibly tough and draining\u2014feeling worn out physically and mentally on top of everything else. Do you find yourself often feeling worthless or guilty in ways that feel more than what the situation would normally call for?\nPatient: Yes, definitely. I find myself overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness pretty much most days. Even when something small goes wrong or I don\u2019t meet some expectation, the guilt I feel feels way out of proportion\u2014like I\u2019m constantly beating myself up over things I shouldn\u2019t even be that upset about. It just piles on top of the fatigue and trouble concentrating, making everything feel ten times harder. When I feel that low, it\u2019s like my energy drains even faster and my mind just won\u2019t settle, which only makes the self-criticism worse. It becomes this vicious cycle where the more exhausted and scattered I feel, the more worthless and guilty I become, and then that drags me down even further. It\u2019s exhausting to live like that every day.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly exhausting\u2014to carry that kind of weight every day and feel stuck in a cycle that just keeps wearing you down. I hear how heavy it all feels for you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s really overwhelming. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m just sinking deeper into this endless exhaustion that doesn\u2019t let up, no matter what I do. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught in this relentless cycle where the heaviness just smothers any motivation or hope I might have. I want to push through, but the weight of all these thoughts and feelings drags me back every time. The self-criticism feels like this constant noise in my head, making it impossible to find even a moment of peace. It\u2019s like I\u2019m trapped inside my own mind, and that exhaustion isn\u2019t just physical\u2014it\u2019s this deep emotional drain that just wears me down more and more each day. I don\u2019t know how to break out of it, and that\u2019s the hardest part.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, constant exhaustion takes a real toll. Can you tell me about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: Actually, I don\u2019t usually have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep during the night. But even when I get a full night\u2019s rest, I still wake up feeling tired\u2014like the rest didn\u2019t really refresh me at all. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s not just about sleep quality; the tiredness feels deeper and more persistent than that, like it\u2019s part of the heaviness I carry during the day. So even though my sleep seems okay, the fatigue sticks around and makes everything else harder.\nDoctor: It sounds like the fatigue runs deeper than just sleep issues and is a constant weight you carry. How does this fatigue affect your daily activities, and do you notice if it gets worse as the day goes on or stays about the same?\nPatient: The fatigue really takes a huge toll on everything I try to do throughout the day. In the morning, I might manage okay, but as the hours pass, I feel myself getting more and more drained\u2014mentally and physically. By the afternoon, even simple things like paying attention in class or completing homework feel overwhelming and exhausting. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this weight pressing down on me that just never lets up, and it gets heavier the longer I\u2019m awake and active. By evening, I\u2019m often just too worn down to do much more than sit quietly, because my energy is almost completely gone. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up and be productive, but my body and mind just won\u2019t cooperate, and that makes everything feel even harder.\nDoctor: That kind of draining energy building up over the day must feel really heavy. Have you noticed if the things you used to enjoy or look forward to doing feel less interesting or satisfying lately?\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t really lost interest in the things I used to enjoy. Drawing, for example, still feels important to me, and when I\u2019m able to do it, it provides some relief. But even with that, the fatigue and mental heaviness make it harder to get started or stay focused for long. So my feelings toward those activities haven\u2019t changed much, but my energy and motivation to do them are definitely worn down by everything else going on. It\u2019s like the desire is still there, but my body and mind just can\u2019t always keep up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that drawing still holds some meaning for you, even with everything else going on. How often do you actually get the chance to draw or do other activities you care about, and what tends to make it easier or harder for you to start or keep going when you try?\nPatient: I guess I draw less often than I used to, mostly because the fatigue and mental heaviness sometimes make it really hard to get started or to keep going once I do. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a block in my mind that holds me back from focusing or feeling inspired. Sometimes taking small breaks or just sitting in a quiet space helps me gather enough energy or calm my thoughts enough to try drawing, but that doesn\u2019t happen very often. Most of the time, it feels like I\u2019m stuck in this fog that makes even the things I care about feel out of reach.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing sounds really hard to break through. To get a fuller picture, I want to ask about your appetite and weight\u2014have you noticed any changes in how much you\u2019re eating or in your weight recently?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t really noticed much change in my appetite or weight. I eat about the same as I always have, but the fatigue and mental fog just keep lingering no matter what. So it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s connected to anything with eating\u2014those feelings just stick around on their own. It\u2019s frustrating because even though my habits are pretty steady, the heaviness in my mind and body doesn\u2019t go away.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. Now, how would you describe your overall mood most days\u2014do you find yourself feeling sad or down beyond the heaviness we\u2019ve talked about?\nPatient: Yes, I do feel sad or down on most days, and it\u2019s more intense than just feeling heavy or tired. It\u2019s this deep sadness that weighs on me and colors how I see everything\u2014like it makes even small challenges feel enormous and sometimes feels almost overwhelming. That sadness affects my mindset a lot, making it harder to stay hopeful or focused, and it adds to the exhaustion I already feel. It\u2019s like carrying this emotional weight on top of the mental and physical fatigue, and honestly, it wears me out just as much, if not more.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, persistent sadness sounds really heavy to carry alongside everything else. How long have you been feeling this way, and how does it affect your daily life or the way you get through your days?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been carrying this sadness and heaviness for several months now, maybe even longer. It\u2019s not just something that comes and goes\u2014it feels like it\u2019s always there, like a weight I can\u2019t shake off. Every day feels like this continuous struggle where even simple tasks require so much effort just to start or keep going. It makes me feel stuck, like I\u2019m trying to push through quicksand but sinking deeper instead. The sadness and fatigue build on each other, making it harder to find the energy or motivation to do things I want to do, even when I know they might help. I\u2019ve tried to manage it in different ways, but often it just feels overwhelming, like I\u2019m trapped in this cycle with no clear way out. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that\u2019s hard to put into words because it\u2019s not just physical tiredness\u2014it\u2019s this all-consuming emotional and mental drain that carries through every moment.\nDoctor: That ongoing weight you describe is really tough to live with. Have you noticed any changes in how your body feels\u2014like feeling unusually slowed down, restless, or agitated compared to before?\nPatient: Yeah, there are definitely times when my body feels slowed down, like moving or even just sitting feels heavier than it used to.

I'd like to check in with you about a few things today.\nPatient: Hi. Um, I guess lately I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days. It\u2019s not like every single moment, but enough that it\u2019s hard to just ignore. Sometimes I find it really tough to focus on schoolwork or even simple things, like my mind just kind of wanders, and it makes everything feel heavier. I also get pretty tired, even when I\u2019m getting enough rest. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up, but my energy just isn\u2019t there sometimes. I guess all of this just makes things feel more overwhelming than they probably should.\nDoctor: It sounds like that heaviness and trouble focusing are really wearing you down. How often are these feelings and the tiredness happening, and how much do they get in the way of your daily life?\nPatient: Honestly, it feels like the heaviness and fatigue are there almost every day. Some days it\u2019s worse, like I wake up already feeling drained, and just getting through the morning feels like a huge effort. Concentrating on anything, even the easiest assignments, becomes a migraine of to-do lists and random thoughts I can\u2019t shut off, so I end up taking twice as long or just giving up because it feels pointless. It\u2019s exhausting\u2014not just physically but mentally\u2014and that just makes me feel even more worthless, like I\u2019m failing at every little thing even when I\u2019m trying so hard. The constant tiredness drags down my motivation too, so it\u2019s this cycle that keeps repeating and I honestly don\u2019t see an end to it sometimes.\nDoctor: That cycle sounds incredibly tough and draining\u2014feeling worn out physically and mentally on top of everything else. Do you find yourself often feeling worthless or guilty in ways that feel more than what the situation would normally call for?\nPatient: Yes, definitely. I find myself overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness pretty much most days. Even when something small goes wrong or I don\u2019t meet some expectation, the guilt I feel feels way out of proportion\u2014like I\u2019m constantly beating myself up over things I shouldn\u2019t even be that upset about. It just piles on top of the fatigue and trouble concentrating, making everything feel ten times harder. When I feel that low, it\u2019s like my energy drains even faster and my mind just won\u2019t settle, which only makes the self-criticism worse. It becomes this vicious cycle where the more exhausted and scattered I feel, the more worthless and guilty I become, and then that drags me down even further. It\u2019s exhausting to live like that every day.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly exhausting\u2014to carry that kind of weight every day and feel stuck in a cycle that just keeps wearing you down. I hear how heavy it all feels for you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s really overwhelming. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m just sinking deeper into this endless exhaustion that doesn\u2019t let up, no matter what I do. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught in this relentless cycle where the heaviness just smothers any motivation or hope I might have. I want to push through, but the weight of all these thoughts and feelings drags me back every time. The self-criticism feels like this constant noise in my head, making it impossible to find even a moment of peace. It\u2019s like I\u2019m trapped inside my own mind, and that exhaustion isn\u2019t just physical\u2014it\u2019s this deep emotional drain that just wears me down more and more each day. I don\u2019t know how to break out of it, and that\u2019s the hardest part.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, constant exhaustion takes a real toll. Can you tell me about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: Actually, I don\u2019t usually have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep during the night. But even when I get a full night\u2019s rest, I still wake up feeling tired\u2014like the rest didn\u2019t really refresh me at all. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s not just about sleep quality; the tiredness feels deeper and more persistent than that, like it\u2019s part of the heaviness I carry during the day. So even though my sleep seems okay, the fatigue sticks around and makes everything else harder.\nDoctor: It sounds like the fatigue runs deeper than just sleep issues and is a constant weight you carry. How does this fatigue affect your daily activities, and do you notice if it gets worse as the day goes on or stays about the same?\nPatient: The fatigue really takes a huge toll on everything I try to do throughout the day. In the morning, I might manage okay, but as the hours pass, I feel myself getting more and more drained\u2014mentally and physically. By the afternoon, even simple things like paying attention in class or completing homework feel overwhelming and exhausting. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this weight pressing down on me that just never lets up, and it gets heavier the longer I\u2019m awake and active. By evening, I\u2019m often just too worn down to do much more than sit quietly, because my energy is almost completely gone. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up and be productive, but my body and mind just won\u2019t cooperate, and that makes everything feel even harder.\nDoctor: That kind of draining energy building up over the day must feel really heavy. Have you noticed if the things you used to enjoy or look forward to doing feel less interesting or satisfying lately?\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t really lost interest in the things I used to enjoy. Drawing, for example, still feels important to me, and when I\u2019m able to do it, it provides some relief. But even with that, the fatigue and mental heaviness make it harder to get started or stay focused for long. So my feelings toward those activities haven\u2019t changed much, but my energy and motivation to do them are definitely worn down by everything else going on. It\u2019s like the desire is still there, but my body and mind just can\u2019t always keep up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that drawing still holds some meaning for you, even with everything else going on. How often do you actually get the chance to draw or do other activities you care about, and what tends to make it easier or harder for you to start or keep going when you try?\nPatient: I guess I draw less often than I used to, mostly because the fatigue and mental heaviness sometimes make it really hard to get started or to keep going once I do. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a block in my mind that holds me back from focusing or feeling inspired. Sometimes taking small breaks or just sitting in a quiet space helps me gather enough energy or calm my thoughts enough to try drawing, but that doesn\u2019t happen very often. Most of the time, it feels like I\u2019m stuck in this fog that makes even the things I care about feel out of reach.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing sounds really hard to break through. To get a fuller picture, I want to ask about your appetite and weight\u2014have you noticed any changes in how much you\u2019re eating or in your weight recently?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t really noticed much change in my appetite or weight. I eat about the same as I always have, but the fatigue and mental fog just keep lingering no matter what. So it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s connected to anything with eating\u2014those feelings just stick around on their own. It\u2019s frustrating because even though my habits are pretty steady, the heaviness in my mind and body doesn\u2019t go away.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. Now, how would you describe your overall mood most days\u2014do you find yourself feeling sad or down beyond the heaviness we\u2019ve talked about?\nPatient: Yes, I do feel sad or down on most days, and it\u2019s more intense than just feeling heavy or tired. It\u2019s this deep sadness that weighs on me and colors how I see everything\u2014like it makes even small challenges feel enormous and sometimes feels almost overwhelming. That sadness affects my mindset a lot, making it harder to stay hopeful or focused, and it adds to the exhaustion I already feel. It\u2019s like carrying this emotional weight on top of the mental and physical fatigue, and honestly, it wears me out just as much, if not more.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, persistent sadness sounds really heavy to carry alongside everything else. How long have you been feeling this way, and how does it affect your daily life or the way you get through your days?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been carrying this sadness and heaviness for several months now, maybe even longer. It\u2019s not just something that comes and goes\u2014it feels like it\u2019s always there, like a weight I can\u2019t shake off. Every day feels like this continuous struggle where even simple tasks require so much effort just to start or keep going. It makes me feel stuck, like I\u2019m trying to push through quicksand but sinking deeper instead. The sadness and fatigue build on each other, making it harder to find the energy or motivation to do things I want to do, even when I know they might help. I\u2019ve tried to manage it in different ways, but often it just feels overwhelming, like I\u2019m trapped in this cycle with no clear way out. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that\u2019s hard to put into words because it\u2019s not just physical tiredness\u2014it\u2019s this all-consuming emotional and mental drain that carries through every moment.\nDoctor: That ongoing weight you describe is really tough to live with. Have you noticed any changes in how your body feels\u2014like feeling unusually slowed down, restless, or agitated compared to before?\nPatient: Yeah, there are definitely times when my body feels slowed down, like moving or even just sitting feels heavier than it used to. It\u2019s not constant, but those moments leave me feeling physically drained, which just adds to the mental and emotional exhaustion I\u2019m already dealing with. I\u2019m not usually restless or agitated all the time, but sometimes the overwhelming feelings make me tense up or feel a kind of restlessness inside, like my body is uncomfortable even when I\u2019m trying to stay calm. It\u2019s another layer to the weariness that can make everything feel even harder.\nDoctor: That physical slowing and occasional restlessness sound like extra weight on top of everything else you\u2019re handling. How often do you notice these feelings, and how much do they get in the way of your daily routines or taking care of yourself?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat physical slowing and occasional restlessness sound like extra weight on top of everything else you\u2019re handling.

It\u2019s like carrying this emotional weight on top of the mental and physical fatigue, and honestly, it wears me out just as much, if not more.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, persistent sadness sounds really heavy to carry alongside everything else. How long have you been feeling this way, and how does it affect your daily life or the way you get through your days?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been carrying this sadness and heaviness for several months now, maybe even longer. It\u2019s not just something that comes and goes\u2014it feels like it\u2019s always there, like a weight I can\u2019t shake off. Every day feels like this continuous struggle where even simple tasks require so much effort just to start or keep going. It makes me feel stuck, like I\u2019m trying to push through quicksand but sinking deeper instead. The sadness and fatigue build on each other, making it harder to find the energy or motivation to do things I want to do, even when I know they might help. I\u2019ve tried to manage it in different ways, but often it just feels overwhelming, like I\u2019m trapped in this cycle with no clear way out. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that\u2019s hard to put into words because it\u2019s not just physical tiredness\u2014it\u2019s this all-consuming emotional and mental drain that carries through every moment.\nDoctor: That ongoing weight you describe is really tough to live with. Have you noticed any changes in how your body feels\u2014like feeling unusually slowed down, restless, or agitated compared to before?\nPatient: Yeah, there are definitely times when my body feels slowed down, like moving or even just sitting feels heavier than it used to. It\u2019s not constant, but those moments leave me feeling physically drained, which just adds to the mental and emotional exhaustion I\u2019m already dealing with. I\u2019m not usually restless or agitated all the time, but sometimes the overwhelming feelings make me tense up or feel a kind of restlessness inside, like my body is uncomfortable even when I\u2019m trying to stay calm. It\u2019s another layer to the weariness that can make everything feel even harder.\nDoctor: That physical slowing and occasional restlessness sound like extra weight on top of everything else you\u2019re handling. How often do you notice these feelings, and how much do they get in the way of your daily routines or taking care of yourself?\nPatient: I notice the physical slowing and restlessness on and off\u2014not every day, but enough that it\u2019s definitely part of what wears me down. When it happens, it makes even usual tasks feel more difficult and draining than they should be. It doesn\u2019t completely stop me from doing what I need to do, but it adds a layer of struggle that makes keeping up with my routines harder. Still, I try to stick with my daily habits as much as I can, even though some days that takes a lot more effort than others.

I'd like to check in with you about a few things today.\nPatient: Hi. Um, I guess lately I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days. It\u2019s not like every single moment, but enough that it\u2019s hard to just ignore. Sometimes I find it really tough to focus on schoolwork or even simple things, like my mind just kind of wanders, and it makes everything feel heavier. I also get pretty tired, even when I\u2019m getting enough rest. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up, but my energy just isn\u2019t there sometimes. I guess all of this just makes things feel more overwhelming than they probably should.\nDoctor: It sounds like that heaviness and trouble focusing are really wearing you down. How often are these feelings and the tiredness happening, and how much do they get in the way of your daily life?\nPatient: Honestly, it feels like the heaviness and fatigue are there almost every day. Some days it\u2019s worse, like I wake up already feeling drained, and just getting through the morning feels like a huge effort. Concentrating on anything, even the easiest assignments, becomes a migraine of to-do lists and random thoughts I can\u2019t shut off, so I end up taking twice as long or just giving up because it feels pointless. It\u2019s exhausting\u2014not just physically but mentally\u2014and that just makes me feel even more worthless, like I\u2019m failing at every little thing even when I\u2019m trying so hard. The constant tiredness drags down my motivation too, so it\u2019s this cycle that keeps repeating and I honestly don\u2019t see an end to it sometimes.\nDoctor: That cycle sounds incredibly tough and draining\u2014feeling worn out physically and mentally on top of everything else. Do you find yourself often feeling worthless or guilty in ways that feel more than what the situation would normally call for?\nPatient: Yes, definitely. I find myself overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness pretty much most days. Even when something small goes wrong or I don\u2019t meet some expectation, the guilt I feel feels way out of proportion\u2014like I\u2019m constantly beating myself up over things I shouldn\u2019t even be that upset about. It just piles on top of the fatigue and trouble concentrating, making everything feel ten times harder. When I feel that low, it\u2019s like my energy drains even faster and my mind just won\u2019t settle, which only makes the self-criticism worse. It becomes this vicious cycle where the more exhausted and scattered I feel, the more worthless and guilty I become, and then that drags me down even further. It\u2019s exhausting to live like that every day.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly exhausting\u2014to carry that kind of weight every day and feel stuck in a cycle that just keeps wearing you down. I hear how heavy it all feels for you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s really overwhelming. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m just sinking deeper into this endless exhaustion that doesn\u2019t let up, no matter what I do. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught in this relentless cycle where the heaviness just smothers any motivation or hope I might have. I want to push through, but the weight of all these thoughts and feelings drags me back every time. The self-criticism feels like this constant noise in my head, making it impossible to find even a moment of peace. It\u2019s like I\u2019m trapped inside my own mind, and that exhaustion isn\u2019t just physical\u2014it\u2019s this deep emotional drain that just wears me down more and more each day. I don\u2019t know how to break out of it, and that\u2019s the hardest part.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, constant exhaustion takes a real toll. Can you tell me about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: Actually, I don\u2019t usually have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep during the night. But even when I get a full night\u2019s rest, I still wake up feeling tired\u2014like the rest didn\u2019t really refresh me at all. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s not just about sleep quality; the tiredness feels deeper and more persistent than that, like it\u2019s part of the heaviness I carry during the day. So even though my sleep seems okay, the fatigue sticks around and makes everything else harder.\nDoctor: It sounds like the fatigue runs deeper than just sleep issues and is a constant weight you carry. How does this fatigue affect your daily activities, and do you notice if it gets worse as the day goes on or stays about the same?\nPatient: The fatigue really takes a huge toll on everything I try to do throughout the day. In the morning, I might manage okay, but as the hours pass, I feel myself getting more and more drained\u2014mentally and physically. By the afternoon, even simple things like paying attention in class or completing homework feel overwhelming and exhausting. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this weight pressing down on me that just never lets up, and it gets heavier the longer I\u2019m awake and active. By evening, I\u2019m often just too worn down to do much more than sit quietly, because my energy is almost completely gone. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up and be productive, but my body and mind just won\u2019t cooperate, and that makes everything feel even harder.\nDoctor: That kind of draining energy building up over the day must feel really heavy. Have you noticed if the things you used to enjoy or look forward to doing feel less interesting or satisfying lately?\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t really lost interest in the things I used to enjoy. Drawing, for example, still feels important to me, and when I\u2019m able to do it, it provides some relief. But even with that, the fatigue and mental heaviness make it harder to get started or stay focused for long. So my feelings toward those activities haven\u2019t changed much, but my energy and motivation to do them are definitely worn down by everything else going on. It\u2019s like the desire is still there, but my body and mind just can\u2019t always keep up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that drawing still holds some meaning for you, even with everything else going on. How often do you actually get the chance to draw or do other activities you care about, and what tends to make it easier or harder for you to start or keep going when you try?\nPatient: I guess I draw less often than I used to, mostly because the fatigue and mental heaviness sometimes make it really hard to get started or to keep going once I do. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a block in my mind that holds me back from focusing or feeling inspired. Sometimes taking small breaks or just sitting in a quiet space helps me gather enough energy or calm my thoughts enough to try drawing, but that doesn\u2019t happen very often. Most of the time, it feels like I\u2019m stuck in this fog that makes even the things I care about feel out of reach.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing sounds really hard to break through. To get a fuller picture, I want to ask about your appetite and weight\u2014have you noticed any changes in how much you\u2019re eating or in your weight recently?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t really noticed much change in my appetite or weight. I eat about the same as I always have, but the fatigue and mental fog just keep lingering no matter what. So it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s connected to anything with eating\u2014those feelings just stick around on their own. It\u2019s frustrating because even though my habits are pretty steady, the heaviness in my mind and body doesn\u2019t go away.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. Now, how would you describe your overall mood most days\u2014do you find yourself feeling sad or down beyond the heaviness we\u2019ve talked about?\nPatient: Yes, I do feel sad or down on most days, and it\u2019s more intense than just feeling heavy or tired. It\u2019s this deep sadness that weighs on me and colors how I see everything\u2014like it makes even small challenges feel enormous and sometimes feels almost overwhelming. That sadness affects my mindset a lot, making it harder to stay hopeful or focused, and it adds to the exhaustion I already feel. It\u2019s like carrying this emotional weight on top of the mental and physical fatigue, and honestly, it wears me out just as much, if not more.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, persistent sadness sounds really heavy to carry alongside everything else. How long have you been feeling this way, and how does it affect your daily life or the way you get through your days?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been carrying this sadness and heaviness for several months now, maybe even longer. It\u2019s not just something that comes and goes\u2014it feels like it\u2019s always there, like a weight I can\u2019t shake off.

I'd like to check in with you about a few things today.\nPatient: Hi. Um, I guess lately I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days. It\u2019s not like every single moment, but enough that it\u2019s hard to just ignore. Sometimes I find it really tough to focus on schoolwork or even simple things, like my mind just kind of wanders, and it makes everything feel heavier. I also get pretty tired, even when I\u2019m getting enough rest. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up, but my energy just isn\u2019t there sometimes. I guess all of this just makes things feel more overwhelming than they probably should.\nDoctor: It sounds like that heaviness and trouble focusing are really wearing you down. How often are these feelings and the tiredness happening, and how much do they get in the way of your daily life?\nPatient: Honestly, it feels like the heaviness and fatigue are there almost every day. Some days it\u2019s worse, like I wake up already feeling drained, and just getting through the morning feels like a huge effort. Concentrating on anything, even the easiest assignments, becomes a migraine of to-do lists and random thoughts I can\u2019t shut off, so I end up taking twice as long or just giving up because it feels pointless. It\u2019s exhausting\u2014not just physically but mentally\u2014and that just makes me feel even more worthless, like I\u2019m failing at every little thing even when I\u2019m trying so hard. The constant tiredness drags down my motivation too, so it\u2019s this cycle that keeps repeating and I honestly don\u2019t see an end to it sometimes.\nDoctor: That cycle sounds incredibly tough and draining\u2014feeling worn out physically and mentally on top of everything else. Do you find yourself often feeling worthless or guilty in ways that feel more than what the situation would normally call for?\nPatient: Yes, definitely. I find myself overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness pretty much most days. Even when something small goes wrong or I don\u2019t meet some expectation, the guilt I feel feels way out of proportion\u2014like I\u2019m constantly beating myself up over things I shouldn\u2019t even be that upset about. It just piles on top of the fatigue and trouble concentrating, making everything feel ten times harder. When I feel that low, it\u2019s like my energy drains even faster and my mind just won\u2019t settle, which only makes the self-criticism worse. It becomes this vicious cycle where the more exhausted and scattered I feel, the more worthless and guilty I become, and then that drags me down even further. It\u2019s exhausting to live like that every day.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly exhausting\u2014to carry that kind of weight every day and feel stuck in a cycle that just keeps wearing you down. I hear how heavy it all feels for you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s really overwhelming. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m just sinking deeper into this endless exhaustion that doesn\u2019t let up, no matter what I do. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught in this relentless cycle where the heaviness just smothers any motivation or hope I might have. I want to push through, but the weight of all these thoughts and feelings drags me back every time. The self-criticism feels like this constant noise in my head, making it impossible to find even a moment of peace. It\u2019s like I\u2019m trapped inside my own mind, and that exhaustion isn\u2019t just physical\u2014it\u2019s this deep emotional drain that just wears me down more and more each day. I don\u2019t know how to break out of it, and that\u2019s the hardest part.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, constant exhaustion takes a real toll. Can you tell me about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: Actually, I don\u2019t usually have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep during the night. But even when I get a full night\u2019s rest, I still wake up feeling tired\u2014like the rest didn\u2019t really refresh me at all. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s not just about sleep quality; the tiredness feels deeper and more persistent than that, like it\u2019s part of the heaviness I carry during the day. So even though my sleep seems okay, the fatigue sticks around and makes everything else harder.\nDoctor: It sounds like the fatigue runs deeper than just sleep issues and is a constant weight you carry. How does this fatigue affect your daily activities, and do you notice if it gets worse as the day goes on or stays about the same?\nPatient: The fatigue really takes a huge toll on everything I try to do throughout the day. In the morning, I might manage okay, but as the hours pass, I feel myself getting more and more drained\u2014mentally and physically. By the afternoon, even simple things like paying attention in class or completing homework feel overwhelming and exhausting. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this weight pressing down on me that just never lets up, and it gets heavier the longer I\u2019m awake and active. By evening, I\u2019m often just too worn down to do much more than sit quietly, because my energy is almost completely gone. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up and be productive, but my body and mind just won\u2019t cooperate, and that makes everything feel even harder.\nDoctor: That kind of draining energy building up over the day must feel really heavy. Have you noticed if the things you used to enjoy or look forward to doing feel less interesting or satisfying lately?\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t really lost interest in the things I used to enjoy. Drawing, for example, still feels important to me, and when I\u2019m able to do it, it provides some relief. But even with that, the fatigue and mental heaviness make it harder to get started or stay focused for long. So my feelings toward those activities haven\u2019t changed much, but my energy and motivation to do them are definitely worn down by everything else going on. It\u2019s like the desire is still there, but my body and mind just can\u2019t always keep up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that drawing still holds some meaning for you, even with everything else going on. How often do you actually get the chance to draw or do other activities you care about, and what tends to make it easier or harder for you to start or keep going when you try?\nPatient: I guess I draw less often than I used to, mostly because the fatigue and mental heaviness sometimes make it really hard to get started or to keep going once I do. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a block in my mind that holds me back from focusing or feeling inspired. Sometimes taking small breaks or just sitting in a quiet space helps me gather enough energy or calm my thoughts enough to try drawing, but that doesn\u2019t happen very often. Most of the time, it feels like I\u2019m stuck in this fog that makes even the things I care about feel out of reach.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing sounds really hard to break through. To get a fuller picture, I want to ask about your appetite and weight\u2014have you noticed any changes in how much you\u2019re eating or in your weight recently?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t really noticed much change in my appetite or weight. I eat about the same as I always have, but the fatigue and mental fog just keep lingering no matter what. So it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s connected to anything with eating\u2014those feelings just stick around on their own. It\u2019s frustrating because even though my habits are pretty steady, the heaviness in my mind and body doesn\u2019t go away.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. Now, how would you describe your overall mood most days\u2014do you find yourself feeling sad or down beyond the heaviness we\u2019ve talked about?\nPatient: Yes, I do feel sad or down on most days, and it\u2019s more intense than just feeling heavy or tired. It\u2019s this deep sadness that weighs on me and colors how I see everything\u2014like it makes even small challenges feel enormous and sometimes feels almost overwhelming. That sadness affects my mindset a lot, making it harder to stay hopeful or focused, and it adds to the exhaustion I already feel. It\u2019s like carrying this emotional weight on top of the mental and physical fatigue, and honestly, it wears me out just as much, if not more.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, persistent sadness sounds really heavy to carry alongside everything else. How long have you been feeling this way, and how does it affect your daily life or the way you get through your days?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been carrying this sadness and heaviness for several months now, maybe even longer. It\u2019s not just something that comes and goes\u2014it feels like it\u2019s always there, like a weight I can\u2019t shake off. Every day feels like this continuous struggle where even simple tasks require so much effort just to start or keep going. It makes me feel stuck, like I\u2019m trying to push through quicksand but sinking deeper instead. The sadness and fatigue build on each other, making it harder to find the energy or motivation to do things I want to do, even when I know they might help. I\u2019ve tried to manage it in different ways, but often it just feels overwhelming, like I\u2019m trapped in this cycle with no clear way out. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that\u2019s hard to put into words because it\u2019s not just physical tiredness\u2014it\u2019s this all-consuming emotional and mental drain that carries through every moment.\nDoctor: That ongoing weight you describe is really tough to live with. Have you noticed any changes in how your body feels\u2014like feeling unusually slowed down, restless, or agitated compared to before?\nPatient: Yeah, there are definitely times when my body feels slowed down, like moving or even just sitting feels heavier than it used to. It\u2019s not constant, but those moments leave me feeling physically drained, which just adds to the mental and emotional exhaustion I\u2019m already dealing with. I\u2019m not usually restless or agitated all the time, but sometimes the overwhelming feelings make me tense up or feel a kind of restlessness inside, like my body is uncomfortable even when I\u2019m trying to stay calm. It\u2019s another layer to the weariness that can make everything feel even harder.\nDoctor: That physical slowing and occasional restlessness sound like extra weight on top of everything else you\u2019re handling. How often do you notice these feelings, and how much do they get in the way of your daily routines or taking care of yourself?\nPatient: I notice the physical slowing and restlessness on and off\u2014not every day, but enough that it\u2019s definitely part of what wears me down. When it happens, it makes even usual tasks feel more difficult and draining than they should be. It doesn\u2019t completely stop me from doing what I need to do, but it adds a layer of struggle that makes keeping up with my routines harder. Still, I try to stick with my daily habits as much as I can, even though some days that takes a lot more effort than others. It\u2019s frustrating, but I don\u2019t want to lose the sense of normalcy those routines give me.\nDoctor: You\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and it\u2019s clear you\u2019re doing your best to hold onto normalcy despite all this strain. It\u2019s important we talk about your safety too\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts about death or suicide. Even though these feelings are really heavy and difficult to carry, I haven\u2019t reached a point where I think about those things. I\u2019m trying to manage the weight of it all without letting it get to that level.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nI haven\u2019t had any thoughts about death or suicide.

How does this fatigue affect your daily activities, and do you notice if it gets worse as the day goes on or stays about the same?\nPatient: The fatigue really takes a huge toll on everything I try to do throughout the day. In the morning, I might manage okay, but as the hours pass, I feel myself getting more and more drained\u2014mentally and physically. By the afternoon, even simple things like paying attention in class or completing homework feel overwhelming and exhausting. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this weight pressing down on me that just never lets up, and it gets heavier the longer I\u2019m awake and active. By evening, I\u2019m often just too worn down to do much more than sit quietly, because my energy is almost completely gone. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up and be productive, but my body and mind just won\u2019t cooperate, and that makes everything feel even harder.\nDoctor: That kind of draining energy building up over the day must feel really heavy. Have you noticed if the things you used to enjoy or look forward to doing feel less interesting or satisfying lately?\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t really lost interest in the things I used to enjoy. Drawing, for example, still feels important to me, and when I\u2019m able to do it, it provides some relief. But even with that, the fatigue and mental heaviness make it harder to get started or stay focused for long. So my feelings toward those activities haven\u2019t changed much, but my energy and motivation to do them are definitely worn down by everything else going on. It\u2019s like the desire is still there, but my body and mind just can\u2019t always keep up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that drawing still holds some meaning for you, even with everything else going on. How often do you actually get the chance to draw or do other activities you care about, and what tends to make it easier or harder for you to start or keep going when you try?\nPatient: I guess I draw less often than I used to, mostly because the fatigue and mental heaviness sometimes make it really hard to get started or to keep going once I do. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a block in my mind that holds me back from focusing or feeling inspired. Sometimes taking small breaks or just sitting in a quiet space helps me gather enough energy or calm my thoughts enough to try drawing, but that doesn\u2019t happen very often. Most of the time, it feels like I\u2019m stuck in this fog that makes even the things I care about feel out of reach.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing sounds really hard to break through. To get a fuller picture, I want to ask about your appetite and weight\u2014have you noticed any changes in how much you\u2019re eating or in your weight recently?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t really noticed much change in my appetite or weight. I eat about the same as I always have, but the fatigue and mental fog just keep lingering no matter what. So it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s connected to anything with eating\u2014those feelings just stick around on their own. It\u2019s frustrating because even though my habits are pretty steady, the heaviness in my mind and body doesn\u2019t go away.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. Now, how would you describe your overall mood most days\u2014do you find yourself feeling sad or down beyond the heaviness we\u2019ve talked about?\nPatient: Yes, I do feel sad or down on most days, and it\u2019s more intense than just feeling heavy or tired. It\u2019s this deep sadness that weighs on me and colors how I see everything\u2014like it makes even small challenges feel enormous and sometimes feels almost overwhelming. That sadness affects my mindset a lot, making it harder to stay hopeful or focused, and it adds to the exhaustion I already feel. It\u2019s like carrying this emotional weight on top of the mental and physical fatigue, and honestly, it wears me out just as much, if not more.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, persistent sadness sounds really heavy to carry alongside everything else. How long have you been feeling this way, and how does it affect your daily life or the way you get through your days?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been carrying this sadness and heaviness for several months now, maybe even longer. It\u2019s not just something that comes and goes\u2014it feels like it\u2019s always there, like a weight I can\u2019t shake off. Every day feels like this continuous struggle where even simple tasks require so much effort just to start or keep going. It makes me feel stuck, like I\u2019m trying to push through quicksand but sinking deeper instead. The sadness and fatigue build on each other, making it harder to find the energy or motivation to do things I want to do, even when I know they might help. I\u2019ve tried to manage it in different ways, but often it just feels overwhelming, like I\u2019m trapped in this cycle with no clear way out. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that\u2019s hard to put into words because it\u2019s not just physical tiredness\u2014it\u2019s this all-consuming emotional and mental drain that carries through every moment.\nDoctor: That ongoing weight you describe is really tough to live with. Have you noticed any changes in how your body feels\u2014like feeling unusually slowed down, restless, or agitated compared to before?\nPatient: Yeah, there are definitely times when my body feels slowed down, like moving or even just sitting feels heavier than it used to. It\u2019s not constant, but those moments leave me feeling physically drained, which just adds to the mental and emotional exhaustion I\u2019m already dealing with. I\u2019m not usually restless or agitated all the time, but sometimes the overwhelming feelings make me tense up or feel a kind of restlessness inside, like my body is uncomfortable even when I\u2019m trying to stay calm. It\u2019s another layer to the weariness that can make everything feel even harder.\nDoctor: That physical slowing and occasional restlessness sound like extra weight on top of everything else you\u2019re handling. How often do you notice these feelings, and how much do they get in the way of your daily routines or taking care of yourself?\nPatient: I notice the physical slowing and restlessness on and off\u2014not every day, but enough that it\u2019s definitely part of what wears me down. When it happens, it makes even usual tasks feel more difficult and draining than they should be. It doesn\u2019t completely stop me from doing what I need to do, but it adds a layer of struggle that makes keeping up with my routines harder. Still, I try to stick with my daily habits as much as I can, even though some days that takes a lot more effort than others. It\u2019s frustrating, but I don\u2019t want to lose the sense of normalcy those routines give me.\nDoctor: You\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and it\u2019s clear you\u2019re doing your best to hold onto normalcy despite all this strain. It\u2019s important we talk about your safety too\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts about death or suicide. Even though these feelings are really heavy and difficult to carry, I haven\u2019t reached a point where I think about those things. I\u2019m trying to manage the weight of it all without letting it get to that level.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear that. Given what you\u2019ve shared about the heaviness and fatigue, has it become harder for you to concentrate or make decisions, even on smaller things?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nI\u2019m glad to hear that.

I'd like to check in with you about a few things today.\nPatient: Hi. Um, I guess lately I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days. It\u2019s not like every single moment, but enough that it\u2019s hard to just ignore. Sometimes I find it really tough to focus on schoolwork or even simple things, like my mind just kind of wanders, and it makes everything feel heavier. I also get pretty tired, even when I\u2019m getting enough rest. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up, but my energy just isn\u2019t there sometimes. I guess all of this just makes things feel more overwhelming than they probably should.\nDoctor: It sounds like that heaviness and trouble focusing are really wearing you down. How often are these feelings and the tiredness happening, and how much do they get in the way of your daily life?\nPatient: Honestly, it feels like the heaviness and fatigue are there almost every day. Some days it\u2019s worse, like I wake up already feeling drained, and just getting through the morning feels like a huge effort. Concentrating on anything, even the easiest assignments, becomes a migraine of to-do lists and random thoughts I can\u2019t shut off, so I end up taking twice as long or just giving up because it feels pointless. It\u2019s exhausting\u2014not just physically but mentally\u2014and that just makes me feel even more worthless, like I\u2019m failing at every little thing even when I\u2019m trying so hard. The constant tiredness drags down my motivation too, so it\u2019s this cycle that keeps repeating and I honestly don\u2019t see an end to it sometimes.\nDoctor: That cycle sounds incredibly tough and draining\u2014feeling worn out physically and mentally on top of everything else. Do you find yourself often feeling worthless or guilty in ways that feel more than what the situation would normally call for?\nPatient: Yes, definitely. I find myself overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness pretty much most days. Even when something small goes wrong or I don\u2019t meet some expectation, the guilt I feel feels way out of proportion\u2014like I\u2019m constantly beating myself up over things I shouldn\u2019t even be that upset about. It just piles on top of the fatigue and trouble concentrating, making everything feel ten times harder. When I feel that low, it\u2019s like my energy drains even faster and my mind just won\u2019t settle, which only makes the self-criticism worse. It becomes this vicious cycle where the more exhausted and scattered I feel, the more worthless and guilty I become, and then that drags me down even further. It\u2019s exhausting to live like that every day.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly exhausting\u2014to carry that kind of weight every day and feel stuck in a cycle that just keeps wearing you down. I hear how heavy it all feels for you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s really overwhelming. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m just sinking deeper into this endless exhaustion that doesn\u2019t let up, no matter what I do. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught in this relentless cycle where the heaviness just smothers any motivation or hope I might have. I want to push through, but the weight of all these thoughts and feelings drags me back every time. The self-criticism feels like this constant noise in my head, making it impossible to find even a moment of peace. It\u2019s like I\u2019m trapped inside my own mind, and that exhaustion isn\u2019t just physical\u2014it\u2019s this deep emotional drain that just wears me down more and more each day. I don\u2019t know how to break out of it, and that\u2019s the hardest part.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, constant exhaustion takes a real toll. Can you tell me about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: Actually, I don\u2019t usually have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep during the night. But even when I get a full night\u2019s rest, I still wake up feeling tired\u2014like the rest didn\u2019t really refresh me at all. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s not just about sleep quality; the tiredness feels deeper and more persistent than that, like it\u2019s part of the heaviness I carry during the day. So even though my sleep seems okay, the fatigue sticks around and makes everything else harder.\nDoctor: It sounds like the fatigue runs deeper than just sleep issues and is a constant weight you carry. How does this fatigue affect your daily activities, and do you notice if it gets worse as the day goes on or stays about the same?\nPatient: The fatigue really takes a huge toll on everything I try to do throughout the day.

By the afternoon, even simple things like paying attention in class or completing homework feel overwhelming and exhausting. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this weight pressing down on me that just never lets up, and it gets heavier the longer I\u2019m awake and active. By evening, I\u2019m often just too worn down to do much more than sit quietly, because my energy is almost completely gone. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up and be productive, but my body and mind just won\u2019t cooperate, and that makes everything feel even harder.\nDoctor: That kind of draining energy building up over the day must feel really heavy.

I'd like to check in with you about a few things today.\nPatient: Hi. Um, I guess lately I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days. It\u2019s not like every single moment, but enough that it\u2019s hard to just ignore. Sometimes I find it really tough to focus on schoolwork or even simple things, like my mind just kind of wanders, and it makes everything feel heavier. I also get pretty tired, even when I\u2019m getting enough rest. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up, but my energy just isn\u2019t there sometimes. I guess all of this just makes things feel more overwhelming than they probably should.\nDoctor: It sounds like that heaviness and trouble focusing are really wearing you down. How often are these feelings and the tiredness happening, and how much do they get in the way of your daily life?\nPatient: Honestly, it feels like the heaviness and fatigue are there almost every day. Some days it\u2019s worse, like I wake up already feeling drained, and just getting through the morning feels like a huge effort. Concentrating on anything, even the easiest assignments, becomes a migraine of to-do lists and random thoughts I can\u2019t shut off, so I end up taking twice as long or just giving up because it feels pointless. It\u2019s exhausting\u2014not just physically but mentally\u2014and that just makes me feel even more worthless, like I\u2019m failing at every little thing even when I\u2019m trying so hard. The constant tiredness drags down my motivation too, so it\u2019s this cycle that keeps repeating and I honestly don\u2019t see an end to it sometimes.\nDoctor: That cycle sounds incredibly tough and draining\u2014feeling worn out physically and mentally on top of everything else. Do you find yourself often feeling worthless or guilty in ways that feel more than what the situation would normally call for?\nPatient: Yes, definitely. I find myself overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness pretty much most days. Even when something small goes wrong or I don\u2019t meet some expectation, the guilt I feel feels way out of proportion\u2014like I\u2019m constantly beating myself up over things I shouldn\u2019t even be that upset about. It just piles on top of the fatigue and trouble concentrating, making everything feel ten times harder. When I feel that low, it\u2019s like my energy drains even faster and my mind just won\u2019t settle, which only makes the self-criticism worse. It becomes this vicious cycle where the more exhausted and scattered I feel, the more worthless and guilty I become, and then that drags me down even further. It\u2019s exhausting to live like that every day.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly exhausting\u2014to carry that kind of weight every day and feel stuck in a cycle that just keeps wearing you down. I hear how heavy it all feels for you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s really overwhelming. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m just sinking deeper into this endless exhaustion that doesn\u2019t let up, no matter what I do. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught in this relentless cycle where the heaviness just smothers any motivation or hope I might have. I want to push through, but the weight of all these thoughts and feelings drags me back every time. The self-criticism feels like this constant noise in my head, making it impossible to find even a moment of peace. It\u2019s like I\u2019m trapped inside my own mind, and that exhaustion isn\u2019t just physical\u2014it\u2019s this deep emotional drain that just wears me down more and more each day. I don\u2019t know how to break out of it, and that\u2019s the hardest part.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, constant exhaustion takes a real toll. Can you tell me about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: Actually, I don\u2019t usually have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep during the night. But even when I get a full night\u2019s rest, I still wake up feeling tired\u2014like the rest didn\u2019t really refresh me at all. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s not just about sleep quality; the tiredness feels deeper and more persistent than that, like it\u2019s part of the heaviness I carry during the day. So even though my sleep seems okay, the fatigue sticks around and makes everything else harder.\nDoctor: It sounds like the fatigue runs deeper than just sleep issues and is a constant weight you carry. How does this fatigue affect your daily activities, and do you notice if it gets worse as the day goes on or stays about the same?\nPatient: The fatigue really takes a huge toll on everything I try to do throughout the day. In the morning, I might manage okay, but as the hours pass, I feel myself getting more and more drained\u2014mentally and physically. By the afternoon, even simple things like paying attention in class or completing homework feel overwhelming and exhausting. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this weight pressing down on me that just never lets up, and it gets heavier the longer I\u2019m awake and active. By evening, I\u2019m often just too worn down to do much more than sit quietly, because my energy is almost completely gone. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up and be productive, but my body and mind just won\u2019t cooperate, and that makes everything feel even harder.\nDoctor: That kind of draining energy building up over the day must feel really heavy. Have you noticed if the things you used to enjoy or look forward to doing feel less interesting or satisfying lately?\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t really lost interest in the things I used to enjoy. Drawing, for example, still feels important to me, and when I\u2019m able to do it, it provides some relief. But even with that, the fatigue and mental heaviness make it harder to get started or stay focused for long. So my feelings toward those activities haven\u2019t changed much, but my energy and motivation to do them are definitely worn down by everything else going on. It\u2019s like the desire is still there, but my body and mind just can\u2019t always keep up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that drawing still holds some meaning for you, even with everything else going on. How often do you actually get the chance to draw or do other activities you care about, and what tends to make it easier or harder for you to start or keep going when you try?\nPatient: I guess I draw less often than I used to, mostly because the fatigue and mental heaviness sometimes make it really hard to get started or to keep going once I do. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a block in my mind that holds me back from focusing or feeling inspired. Sometimes taking small breaks or just sitting in a quiet space helps me gather enough energy or calm my thoughts enough to try drawing, but that doesn\u2019t happen very often. Most of the time, it feels like I\u2019m stuck in this fog that makes even the things I care about feel out of reach.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing sounds really hard to break through. To get a fuller picture, I want to ask about your appetite and weight\u2014have you noticed any changes in how much you\u2019re eating or in your weight recently?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t really noticed much change in my appetite or weight. I eat about the same as I always have, but the fatigue and mental fog just keep lingering no matter what. So it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s connected to anything with eating\u2014those feelings just stick around on their own. It\u2019s frustrating because even though my habits are pretty steady, the heaviness in my mind and body doesn\u2019t go away.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. Now, how would you describe your overall mood most days\u2014do you find yourself feeling sad or down beyond the heaviness we\u2019ve talked about?\nPatient: Yes, I do feel sad or down on most days, and it\u2019s more intense than just feeling heavy or tired. It\u2019s this deep sadness that weighs on me and colors how I see everything\u2014like it makes even small challenges feel enormous and sometimes feels almost overwhelming. That sadness affects my mindset a lot, making it harder to stay hopeful or focused, and it adds to the exhaustion I already feel. It\u2019s like carrying this emotional weight on top of the mental and physical fatigue, and honestly, it wears me out just as much, if not more.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, persistent sadness sounds really heavy to carry alongside everything else. How long have you been feeling this way, and how does it affect your daily life or the way you get through your days?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been carrying this sadness and heaviness for several months now, maybe even longer. It\u2019s not just something that comes and goes\u2014it feels like it\u2019s always there, like a weight I can\u2019t shake off. Every day feels like this continuous struggle where even simple tasks require so much effort just to start or keep going. It makes me feel stuck, like I\u2019m trying to push through quicksand but sinking deeper instead. The sadness and fatigue build on each other, making it harder to find the energy or motivation to do things I want to do, even when I know they might help. I\u2019ve tried to manage it in different ways, but often it just feels overwhelming, like I\u2019m trapped in this cycle with no clear way out. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that\u2019s hard to put into words because it\u2019s not just physical tiredness\u2014it\u2019s this all-consuming emotional and mental drain that carries through every moment.\nDoctor: That ongoing weight you describe is really tough to live with. Have you noticed any changes in how your body feels\u2014like feeling unusually slowed down, restless, or agitated compared to before?\nPatient: Yeah, there are definitely times when my body feels slowed down, like moving or even just sitting feels heavier than it used to. It\u2019s not constant, but those moments leave me feeling physically drained, which just adds to the mental and emotional exhaustion I\u2019m already dealing with. I\u2019m not usually restless or agitated all the time, but sometimes the overwhelming feelings make me tense up or feel a kind of restlessness inside, like my body is uncomfortable even when I\u2019m trying to stay calm. It\u2019s another layer to the weariness that can make everything feel even harder.\nDoctor: That physical slowing and occasional restlessness sound like extra weight on top of everything else you\u2019re handling. How often do you notice these feelings, and how much do they get in the way of your daily routines or taking care of yourself?\nPatient: I notice the physical slowing and restlessness on and off\u2014not every day, but enough that it\u2019s definitely part of what wears me down. When it happens, it makes even usual tasks feel more difficult and draining than they should be. It doesn\u2019t completely stop me from doing what I need to do, but it adds a layer of struggle that makes keeping up with my routines harder. Still, I try to stick with my daily habits as much as I can, even though some days that takes a lot more effort than others. It\u2019s frustrating, but I don\u2019t want to lose the sense of normalcy those routines give me.\nDoctor: You\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and it\u2019s clear you\u2019re doing your best to hold onto normalcy despite all this strain. It\u2019s important we talk about your safety too\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts about death or suicide. Even though these feelings are really heavy and difficult to carry, I haven\u2019t reached a point where I think about those things. I\u2019m trying to manage the weight of it all without letting it get to that level.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear that. Given what you\u2019ve shared about the heaviness and fatigue, has it become harder for you to concentrate or make decisions, even on smaller things?\nPatient: Yeah, on some days, concentrating and making decisions can be surprisingly difficult. It\u2019s not constant, but when the heaviness and fatigue are stronger, my mind feels foggy and it\u2019s like even simple choices or focusing on schoolwork take a lot more effort. It makes things slower and sometimes more frustrating, but it\u2019s not overwhelming all the time. Still, those moments do add to the overall challenge I\u2019m facing day to day.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve been managing a lot\u2014a persistent heaviness that ebbs and flows but never quite lets up. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re pushing through even when your mind and body feel foggiest, and that takes strength.

I'd like to check in with you about a few things today.\nPatient: Hi. Um, I guess lately I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days. It\u2019s not like every single moment, but enough that it\u2019s hard to just ignore. Sometimes I find it really tough to focus on schoolwork or even simple things, like my mind just kind of wanders, and it makes everything feel heavier. I also get pretty tired, even when I\u2019m getting enough rest. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up, but my energy just isn\u2019t there sometimes. I guess all of this just makes things feel more overwhelming than they probably should.\nDoctor: It sounds like that heaviness and trouble focusing are really wearing you down. How often are these feelings and the tiredness happening, and how much do they get in the way of your daily life?\nPatient: Honestly, it feels like the heaviness and fatigue are there almost every day. Some days it\u2019s worse, like I wake up already feeling drained, and just getting through the morning feels like a huge effort. Concentrating on anything, even the easiest assignments, becomes a migraine of to-do lists and random thoughts I can\u2019t shut off, so I end up taking twice as long or just giving up because it feels pointless. It\u2019s exhausting\u2014not just physically but mentally\u2014and that just makes me feel even more worthless, like I\u2019m failing at every little thing even when I\u2019m trying so hard. The constant tiredness drags down my motivation too, so it\u2019s this cycle that keeps repeating and I honestly don\u2019t see an end to it sometimes.\nDoctor: That cycle sounds incredibly tough and draining\u2014feeling worn out physically and mentally on top of everything else. Do you find yourself often feeling worthless or guilty in ways that feel more than what the situation would normally call for?\nPatient: Yes, definitely. I find myself overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness pretty much most days. Even when something small goes wrong or I don\u2019t meet some expectation, the guilt I feel feels way out of proportion\u2014like I\u2019m constantly beating myself up over things I shouldn\u2019t even be that upset about. It just piles on top of the fatigue and trouble concentrating, making everything feel ten times harder. When I feel that low, it\u2019s like my energy drains even faster and my mind just won\u2019t settle, which only makes the self-criticism worse. It becomes this vicious cycle where the more exhausted and scattered I feel, the more worthless and guilty I become, and then that drags me down even further. It\u2019s exhausting to live like that every day.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly exhausting\u2014to carry that kind of weight every day and feel stuck in a cycle that just keeps wearing you down. I hear how heavy it all feels for you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s really overwhelming. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m just sinking deeper into this endless exhaustion that doesn\u2019t let up, no matter what I do. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught in this relentless cycle where the heaviness just smothers any motivation or hope I might have. I want to push through, but the weight of all these thoughts and feelings drags me back every time. The self-criticism feels like this constant noise in my head, making it impossible to find even a moment of peace. It\u2019s like I\u2019m trapped inside my own mind, and that exhaustion isn\u2019t just physical\u2014it\u2019s this deep emotional drain that just wears me down more and more each day. I don\u2019t know how to break out of it, and that\u2019s the hardest part.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, constant exhaustion takes a real toll. Can you tell me about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: Actually, I don\u2019t usually have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep during the night. But even when I get a full night\u2019s rest, I still wake up feeling tired\u2014like the rest didn\u2019t really refresh me at all. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s not just about sleep quality; the tiredness feels deeper and more persistent than that, like it\u2019s part of the heaviness I carry during the day. So even though my sleep seems okay, the fatigue sticks around and makes everything else harder.\nDoctor: It sounds like the fatigue runs deeper than just sleep issues and is a constant weight you carry. How does this fatigue affect your daily activities, and do you notice if it gets worse as the day goes on or stays about the same?\nPatient: The fatigue really takes a huge toll on everything I try to do throughout the day. In the morning, I might manage okay, but as the hours pass, I feel myself getting more and more drained\u2014mentally and physically. By the afternoon, even simple things like paying attention in class or completing homework feel overwhelming and exhausting. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this weight pressing down on me that just never lets up, and it gets heavier the longer I\u2019m awake and active. By evening, I\u2019m often just too worn down to do much more than sit quietly, because my energy is almost completely gone. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to keep up and be productive, but my body and mind just won\u2019t cooperate, and that makes everything feel even harder.\nDoctor: That kind of draining energy building up over the day must feel really heavy. Have you noticed if the things you used to enjoy or look forward to doing feel less interesting or satisfying lately?\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t really lost interest in the things I used to enjoy. Drawing, for example, still feels important to me, and when I\u2019m able to do it, it provides some relief. But even with that, the fatigue and mental heaviness make it harder to get started or stay focused for long. So my feelings toward those activities haven\u2019t changed much, but my energy and motivation to do them are definitely worn down by everything else going on. It\u2019s like the desire is still there, but my body and mind just can\u2019t always keep up.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that drawing still holds some meaning for you, even with everything else going on. How often do you actually get the chance to draw or do other activities you care about, and what tends to make it easier or harder for you to start or keep going when you try?\nPatient: I guess I draw less often than I used to, mostly because the fatigue and mental heaviness sometimes make it really hard to get started or to keep going once I do. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a block in my mind that holds me back from focusing or feeling inspired. Sometimes taking small breaks or just sitting in a quiet space helps me gather enough energy or calm my thoughts enough to try drawing, but that doesn\u2019t happen very often. Most of the time, it feels like I\u2019m stuck in this fog that makes even the things I care about feel out of reach.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing sounds really hard to break through. To get a fuller picture, I want to ask about your appetite and weight\u2014have you noticed any changes in how much you\u2019re eating or in your weight recently?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t really noticed much change in my appetite or weight. I eat about the same as I always have, but the fatigue and mental fog just keep lingering no matter what. So it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s connected to anything with eating\u2014those feelings just stick around on their own. It\u2019s frustrating because even though my habits are pretty steady, the heaviness in my mind and body doesn\u2019t go away.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. Now, how would you describe your overall mood most days\u2014do you find yourself feeling sad or down beyond the heaviness we\u2019ve talked about?\nPatient: Yes, I do feel sad or down on most days, and it\u2019s more intense than just feeling heavy or tired. It\u2019s this deep sadness that weighs on me and colors how I see everything\u2014like it makes even small challenges feel enormous and sometimes feels almost overwhelming. That sadness affects my mindset a lot, making it harder to stay hopeful or focused, and it adds to the exhaustion I already feel. It\u2019s like carrying this emotional weight on top of the mental and physical fatigue, and honestly, it wears me out just as much, if not more.\nDoctor: That kind of deep, persistent sadness sounds really heavy to carry alongside everything else. How long have you been feeling this way, and how does it affect your daily life or the way you get through your days?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been carrying this sadness and heaviness for several months now, maybe even longer. It\u2019s not just something that comes and goes\u2014it feels like it\u2019s always there, like a weight I can\u2019t shake off. Every day feels like this continuous struggle where even simple tasks require so much effort just to start or keep going. It makes me feel stuck, like I\u2019m trying to push through quicksand but sinking deeper instead. The sadness and fatigue build on each other, making it harder to find the energy or motivation to do things I want to do, even when I know they might help. I\u2019ve tried to manage it in different ways, but often it just feels overwhelming, like I\u2019m trapped in this cycle with no clear way out. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that\u2019s hard to put into words because it\u2019s not just physical tiredness\u2014it\u2019s this all-consuming emotional and mental drain that carries through every moment.\nDoctor: That ongoing weight you describe is really tough to live with. Have you noticed any changes in how your body feels\u2014like feeling unusually slowed down, restless, or agitated compared to before?\nPatient: Yeah, there are definitely times when my body feels slowed down, like moving or even just sitting feels heavier than it used to. It\u2019s not constant, but those moments leave me feeling physically drained, which just adds to the mental and emotional exhaustion I\u2019m already dealing with. I\u2019m not usually restless or agitated all the time, but sometimes the overwhelming feelings make me tense up or feel a kind of restlessness inside, like my body is uncomfortable even when I\u2019m trying to stay calm. It\u2019s another layer to the weariness that can make everything feel even harder.\nDoctor: That physical slowing and occasional restlessness sound like extra weight on top of everything else you\u2019re handling. How often do you notice these feelings, and how much do they get in the way of your daily routines or taking care of yourself?\nPatient: I notice the physical slowing and restlessness on and off\u2014not every day, but enough that it\u2019s definitely part of what wears me down. When it happens, it makes even usual tasks feel more difficult and draining than they should be. It doesn\u2019t completely stop me from doing what I need to do, but it adds a layer of struggle that makes keeping up with my routines harder. Still, I try to stick with my daily habits as much as I can, even though some days that takes a lot more effort than others. It\u2019s frustrating, but I don\u2019t want to lose the sense of normalcy those routines give me.\nDoctor: You\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and it\u2019s clear you\u2019re doing your best to hold onto normalcy despite all this strain. It\u2019s important we talk about your safety too\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had any thoughts about death or suicide. Even though these feelings are really heavy and difficult to carry, I haven\u2019t reached a point where I think about those things. I\u2019m trying to manage the weight of it all without letting it get to that level.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear that. Given what you\u2019ve shared about the heaviness and fatigue, has it become harder for you to concentrate or make decisions, even on smaller things?\nPatient: Yeah, on some days, concentrating and making decisions can be surprisingly difficult. It\u2019s not constant, but when the heaviness and fatigue are stronger, my mind feels foggy and it\u2019s like even simple choices or focusing on schoolwork take a lot more effort. It makes things slower and sometimes more frustrating, but it\u2019s not overwhelming all the time. Still, those moments do add to the overall challenge I\u2019m facing day to day.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve been managing a lot\u2014a persistent heaviness that ebbs and flows but never quite lets up. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re pushing through even when your mind and body feel foggiest, and that takes strength. Thanks for being open about all this\u2014it really helps us understand how to support you.\nPatient: It\u2019s not easy to talk about all of this, but I do appreciate that you\u2019re listening and trying to understand. The heaviness and fatigue are still very much there, and some days they feel just as hard as before. But knowing there\u2019s someone who gets what I\u2019m going through\u2014it helps, even if just a little. I\u2019m willing to see where this support can lead, even if it feels overwhelming at times.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
