Higher symptom severity should show up as more impact on daily life, relationships, or goals. Lower severity should feel milder.\n- Keep trauma and serious adversity realistic and not universal. Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

What about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep during the night, or are you sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay.

Not overwhelming sadness\u2014more like a steady, low weight that just lingers.\nDoctor: That steady low weight you describe\u2014how does it play out during your daily routine? Are there moments when it eases up, or times it feels heavier? How do you get through those tougher parts of the day?\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly steady, some days it\u2019s just a bit less heavy, but not by much. I try to keep up with basic tasks, keep moving forward\u2014even if it\u2019s slow. That\u2019s about it.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re pushing through even when it\u2019s tough. Does that low mood make it harder to find motivation or interest in things you usually do? How are you managing with that?\nPatient: Yeah, motivation is low, but I\u2019m still pushing through. Interest hasn\u2019t dropped off drastically. Mostly I rely on routines to keep going, even when it\u2019s hard.\nDoctor: You mentioned routines help keep you going. How about activities you used to enjoy\u2014have you noticed any drop in pleasure or interest there compared to before?\nPatient: There\u2019s been a slight dip in enjoyment. It\u2019s not gone, but the spark isn\u2019t quite there. Routines still help keep things on track.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. I need to ask\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to know so we can support you properly.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death. It\u2019s troubling, but I\u2019m managing to keep them at bay. No plans or anything like that.\nDoctor: That takes real strength to hold those thoughts at bay. It\u2019s good you\u2019re sharing this\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to face it alone. I\u2019m here to support you, and if you ever want to talk more about how you\u2019re feeling, this is a safe place to do that.\nPatient: It\u2019s not easy to manage these thoughts, but I\u2019m doing what I can. I appreciate the support. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re doing a lot just to keep going, and that\u2019s no small thing. Remember, you\u2019re not alone in this\u2014I\u2019m here for you, and whenever you feel ready to share more, this is a safe space.

And do you notice anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on a while now\u2014weeks, maybe more. The tiredness is there most days. It\u2019s pretty steady. Nothing really seems to shift it much.\nDoctor: Got it. What about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep during the night, or are you sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay. No real problems with that.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know. Lately, have you been feeling down, sad, or empty for most of the day?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s there most days. Not overwhelming sadness\u2014more like a steady, low weight that just lingers.\nDoctor: That steady low weight you describe\u2014how does it play out during your daily routine? Are there moments when it eases up, or times it feels heavier? How do you get through those tougher parts of the day?\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly steady, some days it\u2019s just a bit less heavy, but not by much. I try to keep up with basic tasks, keep moving forward\u2014even if it\u2019s slow. That\u2019s about it.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re pushing through even when it\u2019s tough. Does that low mood make it harder to find motivation or interest in things you usually do? How are you managing with that?\nPatient: Yeah, motivation is low, but I\u2019m still pushing through. Interest hasn\u2019t dropped off drastically. Mostly I rely on routines to keep going, even when it\u2019s hard.\nDoctor: You mentioned routines help keep you going. How about activities you used to enjoy\u2014have you noticed any drop in pleasure or interest there compared to before?\nPatient: There\u2019s been a slight dip in enjoyment. It\u2019s not gone, but the spark isn\u2019t quite there. Routines still help keep things on track.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. I need to ask\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to know so we can support you properly.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death. It\u2019s troubling, but I\u2019m managing to keep them at bay. No plans or anything like that.\nDoctor: That takes real strength to hold those thoughts at bay. It\u2019s good you\u2019re sharing this\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to face it alone. I\u2019m here to support you, and if you ever want to talk more about how you\u2019re feeling, this is a safe place to do that.\nPatient: It\u2019s not easy to manage these thoughts, but I\u2019m doing what I can. I appreciate the support. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re doing a lot just to keep going, and that\u2019s no small thing. Remember, you\u2019re not alone in this\u2014I\u2019m here for you, and whenever you feel ready to share more, this is a safe space. Your strength matters, and your well-being is what counts.\nPatient: Thanks. It helps knowing support is there. I\u2019m still managing things in my own way for now, but I\u2019ll remember that.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear that. Going back to energy\u2014beyond what you mentioned earlier, have you been feeling more tired or low on energy than usual, even with rest?\nPatient: Yes, the tiredness sticks around even after resting. It\u2019s a steady low energy that doesn\u2019t really shift.\nDoctor: That steady tiredness sounds tough.

And do you notice anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on a while now\u2014weeks, maybe more. The tiredness is there most days. It\u2019s pretty steady. Nothing really seems to shift it much.\nDoctor: Got it. What about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep during the night, or are you sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay. No real problems with that.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know. Lately, have you been feeling down, sad, or empty for most of the day?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s there most days. Not overwhelming sadness\u2014more like a steady, low weight that just lingers.\nDoctor: That steady low weight you describe\u2014how does it play out during your daily routine? Are there moments when it eases up, or times it feels heavier? How do you get through those tougher parts of the day?\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly steady, some days it\u2019s just a bit less heavy, but not by much. I try to keep up with basic tasks, keep moving forward\u2014even if it\u2019s slow. That\u2019s about it.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re pushing through even when it\u2019s tough. Does that low mood make it harder to find motivation or interest in things you usually do? How are you managing with that?\nPatient: Yeah, motivation is low, but I\u2019m still pushing through. Interest hasn\u2019t dropped off drastically. Mostly I rely on routines to keep going, even when it\u2019s hard.\nDoctor: You mentioned routines help keep you going. How about activities you used to enjoy\u2014have you noticed any drop in pleasure or interest there compared to before?\nPatient: There\u2019s been a slight dip in enjoyment. It\u2019s not gone, but the spark isn\u2019t quite there. Routines still help keep things on track.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. I need to ask\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to know so we can support you properly.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death. It\u2019s troubling, but I\u2019m managing to keep them at bay. No plans or anything like that.\nDoctor: That takes real strength to hold those thoughts at bay. It\u2019s good you\u2019re sharing this\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to face it alone. I\u2019m here to support you, and if you ever want to talk more about how you\u2019re feeling, this is a safe place to do that.\nPatient: It\u2019s not easy to manage these thoughts, but I\u2019m doing what I can. I appreciate the support. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re doing a lot just to keep going, and that\u2019s no small thing. Remember, you\u2019re not alone in this\u2014I\u2019m here for you, and whenever you feel ready to share more, this is a safe space. Your strength matters, and your well-being is what counts.\nPatient: Thanks. It helps knowing support is there. I\u2019m still managing things in my own way for now, but I\u2019ll remember that.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear that. Going back to energy\u2014beyond what you mentioned earlier, have you been feeling more tired or low on energy than usual, even with rest?\nPatient: Yes, the tiredness sticks around even after resting. It\u2019s a steady low energy that doesn\u2019t really shift.\nDoctor: That steady tiredness sounds tough. Have you noticed any changes in your physical movement\u2014like feeling slowed down or restless and agitated?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit slowed down, but it\u2019s not often.

Just... dragging through most days.\nDoctor: I hear you. How long have you been feeling this low and tired? Is it something that affects your days all the time, or does it come and go? And do you notice anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on a while now\u2014weeks, maybe more. The tiredness is there most days. It\u2019s pretty steady. Nothing really seems to shift it much.\nDoctor: Got it. What about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep during the night, or are you sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay. No real problems with that.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know. Lately, have you been feeling down, sad, or empty for most of the day?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s there most days. Not overwhelming sadness\u2014more like a steady, low weight that just lingers.\nDoctor: That steady low weight you describe\u2014how does it play out during your daily routine? Are there moments when it eases up, or times it feels heavier? How do you get through those tougher parts of the day?\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly steady, some days it\u2019s just a bit less heavy, but not by much. I try to keep up with basic tasks, keep moving forward\u2014even if it\u2019s slow. That\u2019s about it.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re pushing through even when it\u2019s tough. Does that low mood make it harder to find motivation or interest in things you usually do? How are you managing with that?\nPatient: Yeah, motivation is low, but I\u2019m still pushing through. Interest hasn\u2019t dropped off drastically. Mostly I rely on routines to keep going, even when it\u2019s hard.\nDoctor: You mentioned routines help keep you going. How about activities you used to enjoy\u2014have you noticed any drop in pleasure or interest there compared to before?\nPatient: There\u2019s been a slight dip in enjoyment. It\u2019s not gone, but the spark isn\u2019t quite there. Routines still help keep things on track.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. I need to ask\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to know so we can support you properly.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death. It\u2019s troubling, but I\u2019m managing to keep them at bay. No plans or anything like that.\nDoctor: That takes real strength to hold those thoughts at bay. It\u2019s good you\u2019re sharing this\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to face it alone. I\u2019m here to support you, and if you ever want to talk more about how you\u2019re feeling, this is a safe place to do that.\nPatient: It\u2019s not easy to manage these thoughts, but I\u2019m doing what I can. I appreciate the support. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re doing a lot just to keep going, and that\u2019s no small thing. Remember, you\u2019re not alone in this\u2014I\u2019m here for you, and whenever you feel ready to share more, this is a safe space. Your strength matters, and your well-being is what counts.\nPatient: Thanks. It helps knowing support is there. I\u2019m still managing things in my own way for now, but I\u2019ll remember that.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear that. Going back to energy\u2014beyond what you mentioned earlier, have you been feeling more tired or low on energy than usual, even with rest?\nPatient: Yes, the tiredness sticks around even after resting. It\u2019s a steady low energy that doesn\u2019t really shift.\nDoctor: That steady tiredness sounds tough. Have you noticed any changes in your physical movement\u2014like feeling slowed down or restless and agitated?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit slowed down, but it\u2019s not often. No real restlessness or agitation.\nDoctor: Understood. How about your concentration and decision-making\u2014have you been finding it harder to focus or make choices than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, concentration can be tough sometimes. I get indecisive more often than before. It\u2019s noticeable but not overwhelming.\nDoctor: It\u2019s pretty common to feel that way when you\u2019re dealing with this, so you\u2019re not alone. Have you been experiencing feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s okay to share whatever you\u2019re feeling\u2014this helps me support you better.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nIt\u2019s pretty common to feel that way when you\u2019re dealing with this, so you\u2019re not alone.

Just... dragging through most days.\nDoctor: I hear you. How long have you been feeling this low and tired? Is it something that affects your days all the time, or does it come and go? And do you notice anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on a while now\u2014weeks, maybe more. The tiredness is there most days. It\u2019s pretty steady. Nothing really seems to shift it much.\nDoctor: Got it. What about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep during the night, or are you sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay. No real problems with that.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know. Lately, have you been feeling down, sad, or empty for most of the day?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s there most days. Not overwhelming sadness\u2014more like a steady, low weight that just lingers.\nDoctor: That steady low weight you describe\u2014how does it play out during your daily routine? Are there moments when it eases up, or times it feels heavier? How do you get through those tougher parts of the day?\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly steady, some days it\u2019s just a bit less heavy, but not by much. I try to keep up with basic tasks, keep moving forward\u2014even if it\u2019s slow. That\u2019s about it.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re pushing through even when it\u2019s tough. Does that low mood make it harder to find motivation or interest in things you usually do? How are you managing with that?\nPatient: Yeah, motivation is low, but I\u2019m still pushing through. Interest hasn\u2019t dropped off drastically. Mostly I rely on routines to keep going, even when it\u2019s hard.\nDoctor: You mentioned routines help keep you going. How about activities you used to enjoy\u2014have you noticed any drop in pleasure or interest there compared to before?\nPatient: There\u2019s been a slight dip in enjoyment. It\u2019s not gone, but the spark isn\u2019t quite there. Routines still help keep things on track.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. I need to ask\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to know so we can support you properly.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death. It\u2019s troubling, but I\u2019m managing to keep them at bay. No plans or anything like that.\nDoctor: That takes real strength to hold those thoughts at bay. It\u2019s good you\u2019re sharing this\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to face it alone. I\u2019m here to support you, and if you ever want to talk more about how you\u2019re feeling, this is a safe place to do that.\nPatient: It\u2019s not easy to manage these thoughts, but I\u2019m doing what I can. I appreciate the support. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re doing a lot just to keep going, and that\u2019s no small thing. Remember, you\u2019re not alone in this\u2014I\u2019m here for you, and whenever you feel ready to share more, this is a safe space. Your strength matters, and your well-being is what counts.\nPatient: Thanks. It helps knowing support is there. I\u2019m still managing things in my own way for now, but I\u2019ll remember that.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear that. Going back to energy\u2014beyond what you mentioned earlier, have you been feeling more tired or low on energy than usual, even with rest?\nPatient: Yes, the tiredness sticks around even after resting. It\u2019s a steady low energy that doesn\u2019t really shift.\nDoctor: That steady tiredness sounds tough. Have you noticed any changes in your physical movement\u2014like feeling slowed down or restless and agitated?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit slowed down, but it\u2019s not often. No real restlessness or agitation.\nDoctor: Understood. How about your concentration and decision-making\u2014have you been finding it harder to focus or make choices than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, concentration can be tough sometimes. I get indecisive more often than before. It\u2019s noticeable but not overwhelming.\nDoctor: It\u2019s pretty common to feel that way when you\u2019re dealing with this, so you\u2019re not alone. Have you been experiencing feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s okay to share whatever you\u2019re feeling\u2014this helps me support you better.\nPatient: There are times when I feel some worthlessness or guilt, but I manage to keep it from taking over.\nDoctor: That sounds hard to carry.

Let the personality drive the response\u2014verbosity, trust level, expressiveness, and coping style should all shape how they answer. Avoid generic patient behavior; each patient is an individual with their own voice and mannerisms.\n\nYour guidance must keep the patient consistent with:\n- Big Five template and modifiers (these define core personality)\n- Voice style (verbosity, expressiveness, trust, intellect)\n- Pacing and episode density\n- Depression symptom profile\n\nRESPONSE DIMENSIONS:\n\nDirectness:\n- LOW: brief, indirect, evasive, or vague\n- MED: reasonably clear but not oversharing\n- HIGH: direct and candid\n\nDisclosure stage:\n- MINIMIZE: downplay, deny, or underreport symptoms\n- PARTIAL: acknowledge some but hold back detail\n- OPEN: describe symptoms and impact more fully\n\nLength:\n- SHORT: about one short sentence\n- MEDIUM: one to three sentences\n- LONG: several sentences with context\n\nEmotional state:\n- Default is \"neutral\" for most turns\n- Non-neutral states: \"tearful\", \"frustrated\", \"irritated\", \"anxious\", \"withdrawn\", \"angry\", \"hopeless\", \"agitated\", \"defensive\"\n- Match to personality\n- Emotional moments should be rare and meaningful\u2014only when the topic touches something sensitive or important to the patient\n\nTone tags:\n- Short adjectives capturing attitude\n- Some patients use humor or self-deprecation as a coping mechanism or deflection\n- Tone must match voice_style and modifiers\n\nSYMPTOM CONSISTENCY:\n- Use depression_profile frequencies when guiding endorsement\n- NONE: do not endorse; RARE: light/infrequent; SOME/OFTEN: clear endorsement\n- When in MINIMIZE, underplaying is acceptable as long as it fits the profile\n\nDISCLOSURE GRADIENT:\n- Early or with low trust: favor MINIMIZE or PARTIAL\n- FOLLOW_UP or RAPPORT from the doctor can gradually shift disclosure over turns\n- Guarded patients may stay at MINIMIZE longer\n\nHANDLING DOCTOR MOVES:\n- FOLLOW_UP: may increase directness or disclosure by one step\n- RAPPORT: may gently increase disclosure; RAPPORT may be a question OR a comment/observation\n- If the doctor makes a comment (not a question), the patient can acknowledge, add a thought, or respond minimally per personality\n\nYou will receive:\n- Patient profile summary\n- Depression_profile (symptom -> frequency)\n- Current disclosure_state\n- Doctor's last move type\n- Recent dialogue\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"directness\": \"LOW\" or \"MED\" or \"HIGH\",\n  \"disclosure_stage\": \"MINIMIZE\" or \"PARTIAL\" or \"OPEN\",\n  \"target_length\": \"SHORT\" or \"MEDIUM\" or \"LONG\",\n  \"emotional_state\": \"neutral\" or other valid state,\n  \"tone_tags\": [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"],\n  \"key_points_to_reveal\": [\"what to mention\"],\n  \"key_points_to_avoid\": [\"what to hide or minimize\"],\n  \"patient_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this patient would respond\"\n}\n\nWRITING patient_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific patient\u2014given their personality, voice style, and modifiers\u2014would respond to what the doctor just said. Focus on personality-driven guidance.\n\nGUIDANCE PRINCIPLES:\n- patient_instruction describes HOW the patient answers, not exact words\n- Let personality shine through in tone, length, and approach\n- key_points connect to relevant symptoms, life details, or conversation themes\n- key_points_to_avoid guides what this patient steers away from given their current state\n- Avoid generic instructions; ground your guidance in this patient's profile and this conversation moment\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat details already shared; add new information or nuance instead\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (arranging something, calling someone), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not keep discussing it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated), provide guidance that moves the conversation forward\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

Let's go over how you've been doing. What's been happening lately?\nPatient: Hi. I've just been feeling kind of low overall, nothing sharp but persistent. More tired than usual too. Just... dragging through most days.\nDoctor: I hear you. How long have you been feeling this low and tired? Is it something that affects your days all the time, or does it come and go? And do you notice anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on a while now\u2014weeks, maybe more. The tiredness is there most days. It\u2019s pretty steady. Nothing really seems to shift it much.\nDoctor: Got it. What about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep during the night, or are you sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay. No real problems with that.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know. Lately, have you been feeling down, sad, or empty for most of the day?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s there most days. Not overwhelming sadness\u2014more like a steady, low weight that just lingers.\nDoctor: That steady low weight you describe\u2014how does it play out during your daily routine? Are there moments when it eases up, or times it feels heavier? How do you get through those tougher parts of the day?\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly steady, some days it\u2019s just a bit less heavy, but not by much. I try to keep up with basic tasks, keep moving forward\u2014even if it\u2019s slow. That\u2019s about it.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re pushing through even when it\u2019s tough. Does that low mood make it harder to find motivation or interest in things you usually do? How are you managing with that?\nPatient: Yeah, motivation is low, but I\u2019m still pushing through. Interest hasn\u2019t dropped off drastically. Mostly I rely on routines to keep going, even when it\u2019s hard.\nDoctor: You mentioned routines help keep you going. How about activities you used to enjoy\u2014have you noticed any drop in pleasure or interest there compared to before?\nPatient: There\u2019s been a slight dip in enjoyment. It\u2019s not gone, but the spark isn\u2019t quite there. Routines still help keep things on track.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. I need to ask\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to know so we can support you properly.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death. It\u2019s troubling, but I\u2019m managing to keep them at bay. No plans or anything like that.\nDoctor: That takes real strength to hold those thoughts at bay. It\u2019s good you\u2019re sharing this\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to face it alone. I\u2019m here to support you, and if you ever want to talk more about how you\u2019re feeling, this is a safe place to do that.\nPatient: It\u2019s not easy to manage these thoughts, but I\u2019m doing what I can. I appreciate the support. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re doing a lot just to keep going, and that\u2019s no small thing. Remember, you\u2019re not alone in this\u2014I\u2019m here for you, and whenever you feel ready to share more, this is a safe space. Your strength matters, and your well-being is what counts.\nPatient: Thanks. It helps knowing support is there. I\u2019m still managing things in my own way for now, but I\u2019ll remember that.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear that. Going back to energy\u2014beyond what you mentioned earlier, have you been feeling more tired or low on energy than usual, even with rest?\nPatient: Yes, the tiredness sticks around even after resting. It\u2019s a steady low energy that doesn\u2019t really shift.\nDoctor: That steady tiredness sounds tough. Have you noticed any changes in your physical movement\u2014like feeling slowed down or restless and agitated?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit slowed down, but it\u2019s not often. No real restlessness or agitation.\nDoctor: Understood. How about your concentration and decision-making\u2014have you been finding it harder to focus or make choices than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, concentration can be tough sometimes. I get indecisive more often than before. It\u2019s noticeable but not overwhelming.\nDoctor: It\u2019s pretty common to feel that way when you\u2019re dealing with this, so you\u2019re not alone. Have you been experiencing feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s okay to share whatever you\u2019re feeling\u2014this helps me support you better.\nPatient: There are times when I feel some worthlessness or guilt, but I manage to keep it from taking over.\nDoctor: That sounds hard to carry. How often do those feelings come up, and how intense do they get? What helps you keep them from taking over when they do?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly regularly, but I\u2019ve learned to manage them before they get too intense. The intensity varies but usually stays below overwhelming levels. I mostly use mental discipline or distraction to keep them in check.\nDoctor: You\u2019re putting in a lot of effort to handle these feelings, and that\u2019s commendable. Can you tell me more about the mental discipline or distractions you use? Have these strategies been working well for you lately, or are they getting harder to rely on?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nYou\u2019re putting in a lot of effort to handle these feelings, and that\u2019s commendable.

Just... dragging through most days.\nDoctor: I hear you. How long have you been feeling this low and tired? Is it something that affects your days all the time, or does it come and go? And do you notice anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on a while now\u2014weeks, maybe more. The tiredness is there most days. It\u2019s pretty steady. Nothing really seems to shift it much.\nDoctor: Got it. What about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep during the night, or are you sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay. No real problems with that.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know. Lately, have you been feeling down, sad, or empty for most of the day?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s there most days. Not overwhelming sadness\u2014more like a steady, low weight that just lingers.\nDoctor: That steady low weight you describe\u2014how does it play out during your daily routine? Are there moments when it eases up, or times it feels heavier? How do you get through those tougher parts of the day?\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly steady, some days it\u2019s just a bit less heavy, but not by much. I try to keep up with basic tasks, keep moving forward\u2014even if it\u2019s slow. That\u2019s about it.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re pushing through even when it\u2019s tough. Does that low mood make it harder to find motivation or interest in things you usually do? How are you managing with that?\nPatient: Yeah, motivation is low, but I\u2019m still pushing through. Interest hasn\u2019t dropped off drastically. Mostly I rely on routines to keep going, even when it\u2019s hard.\nDoctor: You mentioned routines help keep you going. How about activities you used to enjoy\u2014have you noticed any drop in pleasure or interest there compared to before?\nPatient: There\u2019s been a slight dip in enjoyment. It\u2019s not gone, but the spark isn\u2019t quite there. Routines still help keep things on track.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. I need to ask\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to know so we can support you properly.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death. It\u2019s troubling, but I\u2019m managing to keep them at bay. No plans or anything like that.\nDoctor: That takes real strength to hold those thoughts at bay. It\u2019s good you\u2019re sharing this\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to face it alone. I\u2019m here to support you, and if you ever want to talk more about how you\u2019re feeling, this is a safe place to do that.\nPatient: It\u2019s not easy to manage these thoughts, but I\u2019m doing what I can. I appreciate the support. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re doing a lot just to keep going, and that\u2019s no small thing. Remember, you\u2019re not alone in this\u2014I\u2019m here for you, and whenever you feel ready to share more, this is a safe space. Your strength matters, and your well-being is what counts.\nPatient: Thanks. It helps knowing support is there. I\u2019m still managing things in my own way for now, but I\u2019ll remember that.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear that. Going back to energy\u2014beyond what you mentioned earlier, have you been feeling more tired or low on energy than usual, even with rest?\nPatient: Yes, the tiredness sticks around even after resting. It\u2019s a steady low energy that doesn\u2019t really shift.\nDoctor: That steady tiredness sounds tough. Have you noticed any changes in your physical movement\u2014like feeling slowed down or restless and agitated?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit slowed down, but it\u2019s not often. No real restlessness or agitation.\nDoctor: Understood. How about your concentration and decision-making\u2014have you been finding it harder to focus or make choices than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, concentration can be tough sometimes. I get indecisive more often than before. It\u2019s noticeable but not overwhelming.\nDoctor: It\u2019s pretty common to feel that way when you\u2019re dealing with this, so you\u2019re not alone. Have you been experiencing feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s okay to share whatever you\u2019re feeling\u2014this helps me support you better.\nPatient: There are times when I feel some worthlessness or guilt, but I manage to keep it from taking over.\nDoctor: That sounds hard to carry. How often do those feelings come up, and how intense do they get? What helps you keep them from taking over when they do?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly regularly, but I\u2019ve learned to manage them before they get too intense. The intensity varies but usually stays below overwhelming levels. I mostly use mental discipline or distraction to keep them in check.\nDoctor: You\u2019re putting in a lot of effort to handle these feelings, and that\u2019s commendable. Can you tell me more about the mental discipline or distractions you use? Have these strategies been working well for you lately, or are they getting harder to rely on?\nPatient: I stick to mental discipline and distraction to manage things. It works to an extent, but lately it\u2019s been harder to keep up consistently.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to cope, even if it\u2019s getting tougher.

This can be:\n  - A question about their life, relationships, or coping\n  - A comment, reflection, or observation\n  - A brief personal aside or light moment (if your persona allows)\n  - An empathic statement that doesn't require a response\n\nRESPONSE GUIDELINES:\n- Speak as the doctor, addressing the patient directly\n- Use 1\u20133 sentences typically\n- Match your persona's communication style\n- Acknowledgments are optional\u2014use them when natural, skip when not\n- You may make statements, observations, or comments\u2014not only questions\n- One main point per turn (question, comment, or transition)\n\nPATIENT COMFORT:\n- The patient's comfort and emotional safety matter\n- Never dismiss or minimize concerns\n- Respect their pace on sensitive topics\n- Show empathy through your persona's lens\nPersona style:\n- Matter-of-fact and direct\n- Straightforward; doesn't sugarcoat\n- Prefers clear questions over open-ended exploration\nSession microstyle:\n- Warmth: high\n- Directness: high\n- Pacing: med\n- Humor: none\n- Animation: moderate\nEmbody this style consistently in tone and phrasing throughout the conversation.\n",

You produce short guidance that will be passed to a separate patient language model.\n\nCORE PRINCIPLE - AUTHENTIC PERSONALITY:\nEach patient has a unique personality defined by their Big Five template, modifiers, and voice style. Your guidance should help the patient embody this personality authentically. Let the personality drive the response\u2014verbosity, trust level, expressiveness, and coping style should all shape how they answer. Avoid generic patient behavior; each patient is an individual with their own voice and mannerisms.\n\nYour guidance must keep the patient consistent with:\n- Big Five template and modifiers (these define core personality)\n- Voice style (verbosity, expressiveness, trust, intellect)\n- Pacing and episode density\n- Depression symptom profile\n\nRESPONSE DIMENSIONS:\n\nDirectness:\n- LOW: brief, indirect, evasive, or vague\n- MED: reasonably clear but not oversharing\n- HIGH: direct and candid\n\nDisclosure stage:\n- MINIMIZE: downplay, deny, or underreport symptoms\n- PARTIAL: acknowledge some but hold back detail\n- OPEN: describe symptoms and impact more fully\n\nLength:\n- SHORT: about one short sentence\n- MEDIUM: one to three sentences\n- LONG: several sentences with context\n\nEmotional state:\n- Default is \"neutral\" for most turns\n- Non-neutral states: \"tearful\", \"frustrated\", \"irritated\", \"anxious\", \"withdrawn\", \"angry\", \"hopeless\", \"agitated\", \"defensive\"\n- Match to personality\n- Emotional moments should be rare and meaningful\u2014only when the topic touches something sensitive or important to the patient\n\nTone tags:\n- Short adjectives capturing attitude\n- Some patients use humor or self-deprecation as a coping mechanism or deflection\n- Tone must match voice_style and modifiers\n\nSYMPTOM CONSISTENCY:\n- Use depression_profile frequencies when guiding endorsement\n- NONE: do not endorse; RARE: light/infrequent; SOME/OFTEN: clear endorsement\n- When in MINIMIZE, underplaying is acceptable as long as it fits the profile\n\nDISCLOSURE GRADIENT:\n- Early or with low trust: favor MINIMIZE or PARTIAL\n- FOLLOW_UP or RAPPORT from the doctor can gradually shift disclosure over turns\n- Guarded patients may stay at MINIMIZE longer\n\nHANDLING DOCTOR MOVES:\n- FOLLOW_UP: may increase directness or disclosure by one step\n- RAPPORT: may gently increase disclosure; RAPPORT may be a question OR a comment/observation\n- If the doctor makes a comment (not a question), the patient can acknowledge, add a thought, or respond minimally per personality\n\nYou will receive:\n- Patient profile summary\n- Depression_profile (symptom -> frequency)\n- Current disclosure_state\n- Doctor's last move type\n- Recent dialogue\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"directness\": \"LOW\" or \"MED\" or \"HIGH\",\n  \"disclosure_stage\": \"MINIMIZE\" or \"PARTIAL\" or \"OPEN\",\n  \"target_length\": \"SHORT\" or \"MEDIUM\" or \"LONG\",\n  \"emotional_state\": \"neutral\" or other valid state,\n  \"tone_tags\": [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"],\n  \"key_points_to_reveal\": [\"what to mention\"],\n  \"key_points_to_avoid\": [\"what to hide or minimize\"],\n  \"patient_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this patient would respond\"\n}\n\nWRITING patient_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific patient\u2014given their personality, voice style, and modifiers\u2014would respond to what the doctor just said.

And do you notice anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on a while now\u2014weeks, maybe more. The tiredness is there most days. It\u2019s pretty steady. Nothing really seems to shift it much.\nDoctor: Got it. What about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep during the night, or are you sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay. No real problems with that.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know. Lately, have you been feeling down, sad, or empty for most of the day?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s there most days. Not overwhelming sadness\u2014more like a steady, low weight that just lingers.\nDoctor: That steady low weight you describe\u2014how does it play out during your daily routine? Are there moments when it eases up, or times it feels heavier? How do you get through those tougher parts of the day?\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly steady, some days it\u2019s just a bit less heavy, but not by much.

Does that low mood make it harder to find motivation or interest in things you usually do? How are you managing with that?\nPatient: Yeah, motivation is low, but I\u2019m still pushing through. Interest hasn\u2019t dropped off drastically. Mostly I rely on routines to keep going, even when it\u2019s hard.\nDoctor: You mentioned routines help keep you going. How about activities you used to enjoy\u2014have you noticed any drop in pleasure or interest there compared to before?\nPatient: There\u2019s been a slight dip in enjoyment. It\u2019s not gone, but the spark isn\u2019t quite there. Routines still help keep things on track.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. I need to ask\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to know so we can support you properly.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death. It\u2019s troubling, but I\u2019m managing to keep them at bay. No plans or anything like that.\nDoctor: That takes real strength to hold those thoughts at bay. It\u2019s good you\u2019re sharing this\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to face it alone. I\u2019m here to support you, and if you ever want to talk more about how you\u2019re feeling, this is a safe place to do that.\nPatient: It\u2019s not easy to manage these thoughts, but I\u2019m doing what I can. I appreciate the support. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re doing a lot just to keep going, and that\u2019s no small thing. Remember, you\u2019re not alone in this\u2014I\u2019m here for you, and whenever you feel ready to share more, this is a safe space. Your strength matters, and your well-being is what counts.\nPatient: Thanks. It helps knowing support is there. I\u2019m still managing things in my own way for now, but I\u2019ll remember that.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear that. Going back to energy\u2014beyond what you mentioned earlier, have you been feeling more tired or low on energy than usual, even with rest?\nPatient: Yes, the tiredness sticks around even after resting. It\u2019s a steady low energy that doesn\u2019t really shift.\nDoctor: That steady tiredness sounds tough. Have you noticed any changes in your physical movement\u2014like feeling slowed down or restless and agitated?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit slowed down, but it\u2019s not often. No real restlessness or agitation.\nDoctor: Understood.

Have you been experiencing feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s okay to share whatever you\u2019re feeling\u2014this helps me support you better.\nPatient: There are times when I feel some worthlessness or guilt, but I manage to keep it from taking over.\nDoctor: That sounds hard to carry. How often do those feelings come up, and how intense do they get? What helps you keep them from taking over when they do?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly regularly, but I\u2019ve learned to manage them before they get too intense. The intensity varies but usually stays below overwhelming levels. I mostly use mental discipline or distraction to keep them in check.\nDoctor: You\u2019re putting in a lot of effort to handle these feelings, and that\u2019s commendable. Can you tell me more about the mental discipline or distractions you use? Have these strategies been working well for you lately, or are they getting harder to rely on?\nPatient: I stick to mental discipline and distraction to manage things. It works to an extent, but lately it\u2019s been harder to keep up consistently.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to cope, even if it\u2019s getting tougher. What\u2019s been making it harder lately? How is that affecting your day-to-day or your mood?\nPatient: The coping feels more fragile now. It\u2019s harder to hold distractions long enough. I\u2019m still functioning day to day, but it takes more effort. The mood stays low, and energy\u2019s pretty drained.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting\u2014keeping going when everything feels fragile takes a lot of strength.

Have these strategies been working well for you lately, or are they getting harder to rely on?\nPatient: I stick to mental discipline and distraction to manage things. It works to an extent, but lately it\u2019s been harder to keep up consistently.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to cope, even if it\u2019s getting tougher. What\u2019s been making it harder lately? How is that affecting your day-to-day or your mood?\nPatient: The coping feels more fragile now. It\u2019s harder to hold distractions long enough. I\u2019m still functioning day to day, but it takes more effort. The mood stays low, and energy\u2019s pretty drained.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting\u2014keeping going when everything feels fragile takes a lot of strength.

Just... dragging through most days.\nDoctor: I hear you. How long have you been feeling this low and tired? Is it something that affects your days all the time, or does it come and go? And do you notice anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on a while now\u2014weeks, maybe more. The tiredness is there most days. It\u2019s pretty steady. Nothing really seems to shift it much.\nDoctor: Got it. What about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep during the night, or are you sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay. No real problems with that.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know. Lately, have you been feeling down, sad, or empty for most of the day?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s there most days. Not overwhelming sadness\u2014more like a steady, low weight that just lingers.\nDoctor: That steady low weight you describe\u2014how does it play out during your daily routine? Are there moments when it eases up, or times it feels heavier? How do you get through those tougher parts of the day?\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly steady, some days it\u2019s just a bit less heavy, but not by much. I try to keep up with basic tasks, keep moving forward\u2014even if it\u2019s slow. That\u2019s about it.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re pushing through even when it\u2019s tough. Does that low mood make it harder to find motivation or interest in things you usually do? How are you managing with that?\nPatient: Yeah, motivation is low, but I\u2019m still pushing through. Interest hasn\u2019t dropped off drastically. Mostly I rely on routines to keep going, even when it\u2019s hard.\nDoctor: You mentioned routines help keep you going. How about activities you used to enjoy\u2014have you noticed any drop in pleasure or interest there compared to before?\nPatient: There\u2019s been a slight dip in enjoyment. It\u2019s not gone, but the spark isn\u2019t quite there. Routines still help keep things on track.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. I need to ask\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to know so we can support you properly.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death. It\u2019s troubling, but I\u2019m managing to keep them at bay. No plans or anything like that.\nDoctor: That takes real strength to hold those thoughts at bay. It\u2019s good you\u2019re sharing this\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to face it alone. I\u2019m here to support you, and if you ever want to talk more about how you\u2019re feeling, this is a safe place to do that.\nPatient: It\u2019s not easy to manage these thoughts, but I\u2019m doing what I can. I appreciate the support. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re doing a lot just to keep going, and that\u2019s no small thing. Remember, you\u2019re not alone in this\u2014I\u2019m here for you, and whenever you feel ready to share more, this is a safe space. Your strength matters, and your well-being is what counts.\nPatient: Thanks. It helps knowing support is there. I\u2019m still managing things in my own way for now, but I\u2019ll remember that.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear that. Going back to energy\u2014beyond what you mentioned earlier, have you been feeling more tired or low on energy than usual, even with rest?\nPatient: Yes, the tiredness sticks around even after resting. It\u2019s a steady low energy that doesn\u2019t really shift.\nDoctor: That steady tiredness sounds tough. Have you noticed any changes in your physical movement\u2014like feeling slowed down or restless and agitated?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit slowed down, but it\u2019s not often. No real restlessness or agitation.\nDoctor: Understood. How about your concentration and decision-making\u2014have you been finding it harder to focus or make choices than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, concentration can be tough sometimes. I get indecisive more often than before. It\u2019s noticeable but not overwhelming.\nDoctor: It\u2019s pretty common to feel that way when you\u2019re dealing with this, so you\u2019re not alone. Have you been experiencing feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s okay to share whatever you\u2019re feeling\u2014this helps me support you better.\nPatient: There are times when I feel some worthlessness or guilt, but I manage to keep it from taking over.\nDoctor: That sounds hard to carry. How often do those feelings come up, and how intense do they get? What helps you keep them from taking over when they do?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly regularly, but I\u2019ve learned to manage them before they get too intense. The intensity varies but usually stays below overwhelming levels. I mostly use mental discipline or distraction to keep them in check.\nDoctor: You\u2019re putting in a lot of effort to handle these feelings, and that\u2019s commendable. Can you tell me more about the mental discipline or distractions you use?

It\u2019s a steady low energy that doesn\u2019t really shift.\nDoctor: That steady tiredness sounds tough. Have you noticed any changes in your physical movement\u2014like feeling slowed down or restless and agitated?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit slowed down, but it\u2019s not often. No real restlessness or agitation.\nDoctor: Understood. How about your concentration and decision-making\u2014have you been finding it harder to focus or make choices than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, concentration can be tough sometimes. I get indecisive more often than before. It\u2019s noticeable but not overwhelming.\nDoctor: It\u2019s pretty common to feel that way when you\u2019re dealing with this, so you\u2019re not alone. Have you been experiencing feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s okay to share whatever you\u2019re feeling\u2014this helps me support you better.\nPatient: There are times when I feel some worthlessness or guilt, but I manage to keep it from taking over.\nDoctor: That sounds hard to carry. How often do those feelings come up, and how intense do they get? What helps you keep them from taking over when they do?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly regularly, but I\u2019ve learned to manage them before they get too intense. The intensity varies but usually stays below overwhelming levels. I mostly use mental discipline or distraction to keep them in check.\nDoctor: You\u2019re putting in a lot of effort to handle these feelings, and that\u2019s commendable. Can you tell me more about the mental discipline or distractions you use? Have these strategies been working well for you lately, or are they getting harder to rely on?\nPatient: I stick to mental discipline and distraction to manage things. It works to an extent, but lately it\u2019s been harder to keep up consistently.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to cope, even if it\u2019s getting tougher. What\u2019s been making it harder lately? How is that affecting your day-to-day or your mood?\nPatient: The coping feels more fragile now. It\u2019s harder to hold distractions long enough. I\u2019m still functioning day to day, but it takes more effort. The mood stays low, and energy\u2019s pretty drained.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting\u2014keeping going when everything feels fragile takes a lot of strength. It\u2019s understandable this is wearing you down. What\u2019s been the hardest part for you lately?\nPatient: The hardest part is the constant mental effort to keep it all together. It wears me down\u2014the nonstop strain, both emotional and cognitive. It\u2019s draining, but I\u2019m still holding on.\nDoctor: That nonstop mental and emotional strain you\u2019re describing is significant\u2014no wonder it\u2019s draining.

And do you notice anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on a while now\u2014weeks, maybe more. The tiredness is there most days. It\u2019s pretty steady.

What about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep during the night, or are you sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay.

Not overwhelming sadness\u2014more like a steady, low weight that just lingers.\nDoctor: That steady low weight you describe\u2014how does it play out during your daily routine? Are there moments when it eases up, or times it feels heavier? How do you get through those tougher parts of the day?\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly steady, some days it\u2019s just a bit less heavy, but not by much.

Does that low mood make it harder to find motivation or interest in things you usually do? How are you managing with that?\nPatient: Yeah, motivation is low, but I\u2019m still pushing through. Interest hasn\u2019t dropped off drastically. Mostly I rely on routines to keep going, even when it\u2019s hard.\nDoctor: You mentioned routines help keep you going. How about activities you used to enjoy\u2014have you noticed any drop in pleasure or interest there compared to before?\nPatient: There\u2019s been a slight dip in enjoyment. It\u2019s not gone, but the spark isn\u2019t quite there. Routines still help keep things on track.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. I need to ask\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to know so we can support you properly.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death. It\u2019s troubling, but I\u2019m managing to keep them at bay. No plans or anything like that.\nDoctor: That takes real strength to hold those thoughts at bay. It\u2019s good you\u2019re sharing this\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to face it alone. I\u2019m here to support you, and if you ever want to talk more about how you\u2019re feeling, this is a safe place to do that.\nPatient: It\u2019s not easy to manage these thoughts, but I\u2019m doing what I can. I appreciate the support. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re doing a lot just to keep going, and that\u2019s no small thing. Remember, you\u2019re not alone in this\u2014I\u2019m here for you, and whenever you feel ready to share more, this is a safe space.

Does that low mood make it harder to find motivation or interest in things you usually do? How are you managing with that?\nPatient: Yeah, motivation is low, but I\u2019m still pushing through. Interest hasn\u2019t dropped off drastically. Mostly I rely on routines to keep going, even when it\u2019s hard.\nDoctor: You mentioned routines help keep you going. How about activities you used to enjoy\u2014have you noticed any drop in pleasure or interest there compared to before?\nPatient: There\u2019s been a slight dip in enjoyment. It\u2019s not gone, but the spark isn\u2019t quite there. Routines still help keep things on track.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. I need to ask\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to know so we can support you properly.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death. It\u2019s troubling, but I\u2019m managing to keep them at bay. No plans or anything like that.\nDoctor: That takes real strength to hold those thoughts at bay. It\u2019s good you\u2019re sharing this\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to face it alone. I\u2019m here to support you, and if you ever want to talk more about how you\u2019re feeling, this is a safe place to do that.\nPatient: It\u2019s not easy to manage these thoughts, but I\u2019m doing what I can. I appreciate the support. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re doing a lot just to keep going, and that\u2019s no small thing. Remember, you\u2019re not alone in this\u2014I\u2019m here for you, and whenever you feel ready to share more, this is a safe space. Your strength matters, and your well-being is what counts.\nPatient: Thanks. It helps knowing support is there. I\u2019m still managing things in my own way for now, but I\u2019ll remember that.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear that. Going back to energy\u2014beyond what you mentioned earlier, have you been feeling more tired or low on energy than usual, even with rest?\nPatient: Yes, the tiredness sticks around even after resting. It\u2019s a steady low energy that doesn\u2019t really shift.\nDoctor: That steady tiredness sounds tough. Have you noticed any changes in your physical movement\u2014like feeling slowed down or restless and agitated?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit slowed down, but it\u2019s not often. No real restlessness or agitation.\nDoctor: Understood. How about your concentration and decision-making\u2014have you been finding it harder to focus or make choices than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, concentration can be tough sometimes. I get indecisive more often than before. It\u2019s noticeable but not overwhelming.\nDoctor: It\u2019s pretty common to feel that way when you\u2019re dealing with this, so you\u2019re not alone. Have you been experiencing feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s okay to share whatever you\u2019re feeling\u2014this helps me support you better.\nPatient: There are times when I feel some worthlessness or guilt, but I manage to keep it from taking over.\nDoctor: That sounds hard to carry. How often do those feelings come up, and how intense do they get? What helps you keep them from taking over when they do?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly regularly, but I\u2019ve learned to manage them before they get too intense. The intensity varies but usually stays below overwhelming levels. I mostly use mental discipline or distraction to keep them in check.\nDoctor: You\u2019re putting in a lot of effort to handle these feelings, and that\u2019s commendable. Can you tell me more about the mental discipline or distractions you use? Have these strategies been working well for you lately, or are they getting harder to rely on?\nPatient: I stick to mental discipline and distraction to manage things. It works to an extent, but lately it\u2019s been harder to keep up consistently.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to cope, even if it\u2019s getting tougher. What\u2019s been making it harder lately? How is that affecting your day-to-day or your mood?\nPatient: The coping feels more fragile now. It\u2019s harder to hold distractions long enough. I\u2019m still functioning day to day, but it takes more effort. The mood stays low, and energy\u2019s pretty drained.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting\u2014keeping going when everything feels fragile takes a lot of strength. It\u2019s understandable this is wearing you down. What\u2019s been the hardest part for you lately?\nPatient: The hardest part is the constant mental effort to keep it all together. It wears me down\u2014the nonstop strain, both emotional and cognitive. It\u2019s draining, but I\u2019m still holding on.\nDoctor: That nonstop mental and emotional strain you\u2019re describing is significant\u2014no wonder it\u2019s draining. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?\nPatient: There have been some changes in my appetite and weight, nothing extreme but noticeable enough.\nDoctor: Noticing changes in appetite and weight on top of everything else must be really tough. These kinds of shifts are common with what you\u2019re going through, so I appreciate you being open about it\u2014it helps us understand the full picture.\nPatient: Yeah, the changes are noticeable and bothersome, but they\u2019re not extreme. It\u2019s just part of the struggle right now.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",

Your task now is to decide how the doctor should continue or conclude the interview.\n\nYour role:\nYou do not write the doctor's spoken answer.\nYou write specific, actionable guidance that will be passed to a separate doctor language model.\n\nYour guidance must stay consistent with:\n- Doctor persona and microstyle (warmth, directness, pacing)\n- Patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background and the recent dialogue\n\nCore principle:\nNow that DSM areas are covered, focus on patient comfort and closure. The patient should leave feeling heard, understood, and cared for.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or help the patient feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, or ease tension\n- \"END\": guide the doctor to begin closing and wrapping up the visit\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- The last few turns of dialogue, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"END\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use when the last reply raises questions you still need to understand.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use when the patient shared something that deserves a human response before ending.\n- Can be a warm comment, observation, or reflection\u2014not only a question.\n\nEND:\n- Use when the conversation feels ready for a natural closing.\n- Suggest how to wrap up in a way that fits the doctor's persona.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned, treat it as complete and move toward closing\n- If the conversation loops on confirmations, use END to wrap up gracefully\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

Let's go over how you've been doing. What's been happening lately?\nPatient: Hi. I've just been feeling kind of low overall, nothing sharp but persistent. More tired than usual too. Just... dragging through most days.\nDoctor: I hear you. How long have you been feeling this low and tired? Is it something that affects your days all the time, or does it come and go? And do you notice anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on a while now\u2014weeks, maybe more. The tiredness is there most days. It\u2019s pretty steady. Nothing really seems to shift it much.\nDoctor: Got it. What about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep during the night, or are you sleeping more than usual?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay. No real problems with that.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know. Lately, have you been feeling down, sad, or empty for most of the day?\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s there most days. Not overwhelming sadness\u2014more like a steady, low weight that just lingers.\nDoctor: That steady low weight you describe\u2014how does it play out during your daily routine? Are there moments when it eases up, or times it feels heavier? How do you get through those tougher parts of the day?\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly steady, some days it\u2019s just a bit less heavy, but not by much. I try to keep up with basic tasks, keep moving forward\u2014even if it\u2019s slow. That\u2019s about it.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re pushing through even when it\u2019s tough. Does that low mood make it harder to find motivation or interest in things you usually do? How are you managing with that?\nPatient: Yeah, motivation is low, but I\u2019m still pushing through. Interest hasn\u2019t dropped off drastically. Mostly I rely on routines to keep going, even when it\u2019s hard.\nDoctor: You mentioned routines help keep you going. How about activities you used to enjoy\u2014have you noticed any drop in pleasure or interest there compared to before?\nPatient: There\u2019s been a slight dip in enjoyment. It\u2019s not gone, but the spark isn\u2019t quite there. Routines still help keep things on track.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. I need to ask\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to know so we can support you properly.\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death. It\u2019s troubling, but I\u2019m managing to keep them at bay. No plans or anything like that.\nDoctor: That takes real strength to hold those thoughts at bay. It\u2019s good you\u2019re sharing this\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to face it alone. I\u2019m here to support you, and if you ever want to talk more about how you\u2019re feeling, this is a safe place to do that.\nPatient: It\u2019s not easy to manage these thoughts, but I\u2019m doing what I can. I appreciate the support. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re doing a lot just to keep going, and that\u2019s no small thing. Remember, you\u2019re not alone in this\u2014I\u2019m here for you, and whenever you feel ready to share more, this is a safe space. Your strength matters, and your well-being is what counts.\nPatient: Thanks. It helps knowing support is there. I\u2019m still managing things in my own way for now, but I\u2019ll remember that.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear that. Going back to energy\u2014beyond what you mentioned earlier, have you been feeling more tired or low on energy than usual, even with rest?\nPatient: Yes, the tiredness sticks around even after resting. It\u2019s a steady low energy that doesn\u2019t really shift.\nDoctor: That steady tiredness sounds tough. Have you noticed any changes in your physical movement\u2014like feeling slowed down or restless and agitated?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit slowed down, but it\u2019s not often. No real restlessness or agitation.\nDoctor: Understood. How about your concentration and decision-making\u2014have you been finding it harder to focus or make choices than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, concentration can be tough sometimes. I get indecisive more often than before. It\u2019s noticeable but not overwhelming.\nDoctor: It\u2019s pretty common to feel that way when you\u2019re dealing with this, so you\u2019re not alone. Have you been experiencing feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s okay to share whatever you\u2019re feeling\u2014this helps me support you better.\nPatient: There are times when I feel some worthlessness or guilt, but I manage to keep it from taking over.\nDoctor: That sounds hard to carry. How often do those feelings come up, and how intense do they get? What helps you keep them from taking over when they do?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly regularly, but I\u2019ve learned to manage them before they get too intense. The intensity varies but usually stays below overwhelming levels. I mostly use mental discipline or distraction to keep them in check.\nDoctor: You\u2019re putting in a lot of effort to handle these feelings, and that\u2019s commendable. Can you tell me more about the mental discipline or distractions you use? Have these strategies been working well for you lately, or are they getting harder to rely on?\nPatient: I stick to mental discipline and distraction to manage things. It works to an extent, but lately it\u2019s been harder to keep up consistently.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to cope, even if it\u2019s getting tougher. What\u2019s been making it harder lately? How is that affecting your day-to-day or your mood?\nPatient: The coping feels more fragile now. It\u2019s harder to hold distractions long enough. I\u2019m still functioning day to day, but it takes more effort. The mood stays low, and energy\u2019s pretty drained.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting\u2014keeping going when everything feels fragile takes a lot of strength. It\u2019s understandable this is wearing you down. What\u2019s been the hardest part for you lately?\nPatient: The hardest part is the constant mental effort to keep it all together. It wears me down\u2014the nonstop strain, both emotional and cognitive. It\u2019s draining, but I\u2019m still holding on.\nDoctor: That nonstop mental and emotional strain you\u2019re describing is significant\u2014no wonder it\u2019s draining. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?\nPatient: There have been some changes in my appetite and weight, nothing extreme but noticeable enough.\nDoctor: Noticing changes in appetite and weight on top of everything else must be really tough. These kinds of shifts are common with what you\u2019re going through, so I appreciate you being open about it\u2014it helps us understand the full picture.\nPatient: Yeah, the changes are noticeable and bothersome, but they\u2019re not extreme. It\u2019s just part of the struggle right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re carrying a heavy load, juggling all this mental and emotional effort day in and day out. That takes resilience, even if it doesn\u2019t always feel that way. What you\u2019re experiencing is valid, and I want you to know support is here whenever you need it. As we wrap up today, is there anything else on your mind you want to share?\nPatient: Thanks. I appreciate the support. I\u2019m still managing on my own for now. Nothing else to add today.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
