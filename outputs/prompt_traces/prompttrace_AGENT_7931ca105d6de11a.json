Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

And when it does, how does that affect your ability to get through your daily tasks? Also, tell me more about your focus\u2014how much trouble are you having concentrating? Lastly, how persistent is this feeling of being worn out or low energy?\nPatient: My mood shifts a few times a week, nothing extreme but enough to mess with routine. It\u2019s disruptive, though I try not to let it completely slow me down. Concentration is a constant struggle\u2014I notice it a lot more than I\u2019d like.

I probably blame myself too much for not handling it better.\nDoctor: You mentioned blaming yourself a lot.

They come with a weight I try not to show, but it\u2019s there, loud and persistent. I get stuck blaming myself more than I should, though I know it doesn\u2019t help. I don\u2019t want to go into all of it right now.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy burden to carry, and it takes strength to keep going despite it.

You\u2019re not alone in this.\nPatient: It\u2019s exhausting, carrying it all, but I\u2019m still here.

I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep. Thanks for checking.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any recent changes in your weight or appetite? If so, has that affected your day-to-day life or caused you concern?\nPatient: No changes in weight or appetite. It hasn\u2019t really affected anything.\nDoctor: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently?\nPatient: I\u2019ve thought about death a few times, but it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s just there, I guess.\nDoctor: Can you tell me more about those thoughts\u2014how often they come up and if there\u2019s anything specific that triggers them?

I\u2019m not ready to dig deeper into it yet, but it\u2019s there, and I\u2019m aware of it.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. Have you noticed feeling physically restless or slowed down in your movements or thinking lately?\nPatient: Physically restless or slowed down happens rarely. But my thinking gets slowed more often, making it harder to keep up with tasks sometimes. It\u2019s frustrating, but I manage.\nDoctor: How often does this slowing of thought occur, and how much does it interfere with your concentration and decision-making during the day? Does it affect your ability to handle things like work, studies, or daily responsibilities?\nPatient: Slowed thinking hits me a lot, making it tough to focus or make decisions.

And when it does, how does that affect your ability to get through your daily tasks? Also, tell me more about your focus\u2014how much trouble are you having concentrating? Lastly, how persistent is this feeling of being worn out or low energy?\nPatient: My mood shifts a few times a week, nothing extreme but enough to mess with routine.

The tiredness never really goes away, but I push through because I don\u2019t have much choice. I probably blame myself too much for not handling it better.\nDoctor: You mentioned blaming yourself a lot.

They come with a weight I try not to show, but it\u2019s there, loud and persistent. I get stuck blaming myself more than I should, though I know it doesn\u2019t help. I don\u2019t want to go into all of it right now.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy burden to carry, and it takes strength to keep going despite it. I understand not wanting to dig into everything right now\u2014whenever you're ready, we can take it at your pace. You\u2019re not alone in this.\nPatient: It\u2019s exhausting, carrying it all, but I\u2019m still here.

I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep. Thanks for checking.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any recent changes in your weight or appetite? If so, has that affected your day-to-day life or caused you concern?\nPatient: No changes in weight or appetite. It hasn\u2019t really affected anything.\nDoctor: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently?\nPatient: I\u2019ve thought about death a few times, but it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s just there, I guess.\nDoctor: Can you tell me more about those thoughts\u2014how often they come up and if there\u2019s anything specific that triggers them? Have you thought about any plans or steps, or are these more general feelings? I\u2019m here to listen without judgment, just want to understand so I can support you best.\nPatient: They come up now and then, mostly vague and without any clear trigger.

I\u2019m not ready to dig deeper into it yet, but it\u2019s there, and I\u2019m aware of it.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. Have you noticed feeling physically restless or slowed down in your movements or thinking lately?\nPatient: Physically restless or slowed down happens rarely. But my thinking gets slowed more often, making it harder to keep up with tasks sometimes. It\u2019s frustrating, but I manage.\nDoctor: How often does this slowing of thought occur, and how much does it interfere with your concentration and decision-making during the day? Does it affect your ability to handle things like work, studies, or daily responsibilities?\nPatient: Slowed thinking hits me a lot, making it tough to focus or make decisions. It messes with work and daily tasks more than I\u2019d like. I feel like I should be doing better, but I\u2019m stuck anyway.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly frustrating, doing your best but feeling stuck like this. Can you give me some examples of how slowed thinking makes daily tasks or decisions harder? And does this happen most days or just some of the time?\nPatient: Slowed thinking is almost every day now. I struggle to figure out what needs doing first and find myself second-guessing every choice, even small ones. It\u2019s like my brain just won\u2019t cooperate, no matter how much I try.

And when it does, how does that affect your ability to get through your daily tasks? Also, tell me more about your focus\u2014how much trouble are you having concentrating? Lastly, how persistent is this feeling of being worn out or low energy?\nPatient: My mood shifts a few times a week, nothing extreme but enough to mess with routine. It\u2019s disruptive, though I try not to let it completely slow me down. Concentration is a constant struggle\u2014I notice it a lot more than I\u2019d like. The tiredness never really goes away, but I push through because I don\u2019t have much choice. I probably blame myself too much for not handling it better.\nDoctor: You mentioned blaming yourself a lot. How often do you feel worthless or guilty, and how strong are those feelings when they come up?\nPatient: Those feelings hit me several times a week, and they\u2019re hard to shake. They come with a weight I try not to show, but it\u2019s there, loud and persistent. I get stuck blaming myself more than I should, though I know it doesn\u2019t help. I don\u2019t want to go into all of it right now.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy burden to carry, and it takes strength to keep going despite it. I understand not wanting to dig into everything right now\u2014whenever you're ready, we can take it at your pace. You\u2019re not alone in this.\nPatient: It\u2019s exhausting, carrying it all, but I\u2019m still here. I appreciate you letting me set the pace\u2014I\u2019m not ready to unpack everything yet.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing real resilience by staying present through all this. How have your sleep patterns been lately? Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s been alright, nothing major. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep. Thanks for checking.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any recent changes in your weight or appetite? If so, has that affected your day-to-day life or caused you concern?\nPatient: No changes in weight or appetite. It hasn\u2019t really affected anything.\nDoctor: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently?\nPatient: I\u2019ve thought about death a few times, but it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s just there, I guess.\nDoctor: Can you tell me more about those thoughts\u2014how often they come up and if there\u2019s anything specific that triggers them? Have you thought about any plans or steps, or are these more general feelings? I\u2019m here to listen without judgment, just want to understand so I can support you best.\nPatient: They come up now and then, mostly vague and without any clear trigger. I haven\u2019t made any plans or done anything\u2014just fleeting thoughts that I try not to dwell on. I\u2019m not ready to dig deeper into it yet, but it\u2019s there, and I\u2019m aware of it.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. Have you noticed feeling physically restless or slowed down in your movements or thinking lately?\nPatient: Physically restless or slowed down happens rarely. But my thinking gets slowed more often, making it harder to keep up with tasks sometimes. It\u2019s frustrating, but I manage.\nDoctor: How often does this slowing of thought occur, and how much does it interfere with your concentration and decision-making during the day? Does it affect your ability to handle things like work, studies, or daily responsibilities?\nPatient: Slowed thinking hits me a lot, making it tough to focus or make decisions. It messes with work and daily tasks more than I\u2019d like. I feel like I should be doing better, but I\u2019m stuck anyway.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly frustrating, doing your best but feeling stuck like this. Can you give me some examples of how slowed thinking makes daily tasks or decisions harder? And does this happen most days or just some of the time?\nPatient: Slowed thinking is almost every day now. I struggle to figure out what needs doing first and find myself second-guessing every choice, even small ones. It\u2019s like my brain just won\u2019t cooperate, no matter how much I try. That just makes me blame myself more because I feel like I should be able to handle it better.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn out before, so I want to ask more directly\u2014how often do you feel physically drained or low on energy? Does this fatigue get in the way of your daily activities?\nPatient: Fatigue hits me most days, draining me enough that it slows down everything I need to do. I push through it because I don\u2019t feel like I have a choice, but it\u2019s frustrating not to do better. I blame myself for letting it knock me down so often.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nFatigue hits me most days, draining me enough that it slows down everything I need to do.

There are days when I just feel worn out, like the energy's gone. It's frustrating but... that's where I\u2019m at.\nDoctor: How often do you notice your mood shifting during the day or week? And when it does, how does that affect your ability to get through your daily tasks? Also, tell me more about your focus\u2014how much trouble are you having concentrating? Lastly, how persistent is this feeling of being worn out or low energy?\nPatient: My mood shifts a few times a week, nothing extreme but enough to mess with routine. It\u2019s disruptive, though I try not to let it completely slow me down. Concentration is a constant struggle\u2014I notice it a lot more than I\u2019d like. The tiredness never really goes away, but I push through because I don\u2019t have much choice. I probably blame myself too much for not handling it better.\nDoctor: You mentioned blaming yourself a lot. How often do you feel worthless or guilty, and how strong are those feelings when they come up?\nPatient: Those feelings hit me several times a week, and they\u2019re hard to shake. They come with a weight I try not to show, but it\u2019s there, loud and persistent. I get stuck blaming myself more than I should, though I know it doesn\u2019t help. I don\u2019t want to go into all of it right now.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy burden to carry, and it takes strength to keep going despite it. I understand not wanting to dig into everything right now\u2014whenever you're ready, we can take it at your pace. You\u2019re not alone in this.\nPatient: It\u2019s exhausting, carrying it all, but I\u2019m still here. I appreciate you letting me set the pace\u2014I\u2019m not ready to unpack everything yet.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing real resilience by staying present through all this. How have your sleep patterns been lately? Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s been alright, nothing major. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep. Thanks for checking.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any recent changes in your weight or appetite? If so, has that affected your day-to-day life or caused you concern?\nPatient: No changes in weight or appetite. It hasn\u2019t really affected anything.\nDoctor: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently?\nPatient: I\u2019ve thought about death a few times, but it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s just there, I guess.\nDoctor: Can you tell me more about those thoughts\u2014how often they come up and if there\u2019s anything specific that triggers them? Have you thought about any plans or steps, or are these more general feelings? I\u2019m here to listen without judgment, just want to understand so I can support you best.\nPatient: They come up now and then, mostly vague and without any clear trigger. I haven\u2019t made any plans or done anything\u2014just fleeting thoughts that I try not to dwell on. I\u2019m not ready to dig deeper into it yet, but it\u2019s there, and I\u2019m aware of it.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. Have you noticed feeling physically restless or slowed down in your movements or thinking lately?\nPatient: Physically restless or slowed down happens rarely. But my thinking gets slowed more often, making it harder to keep up with tasks sometimes. It\u2019s frustrating, but I manage.\nDoctor: How often does this slowing of thought occur, and how much does it interfere with your concentration and decision-making during the day? Does it affect your ability to handle things like work, studies, or daily responsibilities?\nPatient: Slowed thinking hits me a lot, making it tough to focus or make decisions. It messes with work and daily tasks more than I\u2019d like. I feel like I should be doing better, but I\u2019m stuck anyway.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly frustrating, doing your best but feeling stuck like this. Can you give me some examples of how slowed thinking makes daily tasks or decisions harder? And does this happen most days or just some of the time?\nPatient: Slowed thinking is almost every day now. I struggle to figure out what needs doing first and find myself second-guessing every choice, even small ones. It\u2019s like my brain just won\u2019t cooperate, no matter how much I try. That just makes me blame myself more because I feel like I should be able to handle it better.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn out before, so I want to ask more directly\u2014how often do you feel physically drained or low on energy? Does this fatigue get in the way of your daily activities?\nPatient: Fatigue hits me most days, draining me enough that it slows down everything I need to do. I push through it because I don\u2019t feel like I have a choice, but it\u2019s frustrating not to do better. I blame myself for letting it knock me down so often.\nDoctor: You\u2019re pushing through a lot, and that takes real strength\u2014even if it feels unfair to blame yourself. It makes sense to feel frustrated given how much you\u2019re dealing with, and this is a safe place to share however much you\u2019re ready to.\nPatient: Thanks. I get that I\u2019m strong for keeping at it, but the self-blame won\u2019t let up\u2014it feels so unfair, but I can\u2019t stop.

And when it does, how does that affect your ability to get through your daily tasks? Also, tell me more about your focus\u2014how much trouble are you having concentrating? Lastly, how persistent is this feeling of being worn out or low energy?\nPatient: My mood shifts a few times a week, nothing extreme but enough to mess with routine. It\u2019s disruptive, though I try not to let it completely slow me down. Concentration is a constant struggle\u2014I notice it a lot more than I\u2019d like. The tiredness never really goes away, but I push through because I don\u2019t have much choice. I probably blame myself too much for not handling it better.\nDoctor: You mentioned blaming yourself a lot. How often do you feel worthless or guilty, and how strong are those feelings when they come up?\nPatient: Those feelings hit me several times a week, and they\u2019re hard to shake. They come with a weight I try not to show, but it\u2019s there, loud and persistent. I get stuck blaming myself more than I should, though I know it doesn\u2019t help. I don\u2019t want to go into all of it right now.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy burden to carry, and it takes strength to keep going despite it. I understand not wanting to dig into everything right now\u2014whenever you're ready, we can take it at your pace. You\u2019re not alone in this.\nPatient: It\u2019s exhausting, carrying it all, but I\u2019m still here. I appreciate you letting me set the pace\u2014I\u2019m not ready to unpack everything yet.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing real resilience by staying present through all this. How have your sleep patterns been lately? Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s been alright, nothing major. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep. Thanks for checking.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any recent changes in your weight or appetite? If so, has that affected your day-to-day life or caused you concern?\nPatient: No changes in weight or appetite. It hasn\u2019t really affected anything.\nDoctor: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently?\nPatient: I\u2019ve thought about death a few times, but it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s just there, I guess.\nDoctor: Can you tell me more about those thoughts\u2014how often they come up and if there\u2019s anything specific that triggers them? Have you thought about any plans or steps, or are these more general feelings? I\u2019m here to listen without judgment, just want to understand so I can support you best.\nPatient: They come up now and then, mostly vague and without any clear trigger. I haven\u2019t made any plans or done anything\u2014just fleeting thoughts that I try not to dwell on. I\u2019m not ready to dig deeper into it yet, but it\u2019s there, and I\u2019m aware of it.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. Have you noticed feeling physically restless or slowed down in your movements or thinking lately?\nPatient: Physically restless or slowed down happens rarely. But my thinking gets slowed more often, making it harder to keep up with tasks sometimes. It\u2019s frustrating, but I manage.\nDoctor: How often does this slowing of thought occur, and how much does it interfere with your concentration and decision-making during the day? Does it affect your ability to handle things like work, studies, or daily responsibilities?\nPatient: Slowed thinking hits me a lot, making it tough to focus or make decisions. It messes with work and daily tasks more than I\u2019d like. I feel like I should be doing better, but I\u2019m stuck anyway.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly frustrating, doing your best but feeling stuck like this. Can you give me some examples of how slowed thinking makes daily tasks or decisions harder? And does this happen most days or just some of the time?\nPatient: Slowed thinking is almost every day now. I struggle to figure out what needs doing first and find myself second-guessing every choice, even small ones. It\u2019s like my brain just won\u2019t cooperate, no matter how much I try. That just makes me blame myself more because I feel like I should be able to handle it better.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn out before, so I want to ask more directly\u2014how often do you feel physically drained or low on energy? Does this fatigue get in the way of your daily activities?\nPatient: Fatigue hits me most days, draining me enough that it slows down everything I need to do. I push through it because I don\u2019t feel like I have a choice, but it\u2019s frustrating not to do better. I blame myself for letting it knock me down so often.\nDoctor: You\u2019re pushing through a lot, and that takes real strength\u2014even if it feels unfair to blame yourself. It makes sense to feel frustrated given how much you\u2019re dealing with, and this is a safe place to share however much you\u2019re ready to.\nPatient: Thanks. I get that I\u2019m strong for keeping at it, but the self-blame won\u2019t let up\u2014it feels so unfair, but I can\u2019t stop. I appreciate this being a space where I don\u2019t have to explain everything yet.\nDoctor: Have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed that.

Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use when the last reply raises questions you still need to understand.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use when the patient shared something that deserves a human response before ending.\n- Can be a warm comment, observation, or reflection\u2014not only a question.\n\nEND:\n- Use when the conversation feels ready for a natural closing.\n- Suggest how to wrap up in a way that fits the doctor's persona.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned, treat it as complete and move toward closing\n- If the conversation loops on confirmations, use END to wrap up gracefully\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

Let's talk about how you've been doing.\nPatient: I've been having some trouble keeping my mood steady, and focusing hasn't been easy. There are days when I just feel worn out, like the energy's gone. It's frustrating but... that's where I\u2019m at.\nDoctor: How often do you notice your mood shifting during the day or week? And when it does, how does that affect your ability to get through your daily tasks? Also, tell me more about your focus\u2014how much trouble are you having concentrating? Lastly, how persistent is this feeling of being worn out or low energy?\nPatient: My mood shifts a few times a week, nothing extreme but enough to mess with routine. It\u2019s disruptive, though I try not to let it completely slow me down. Concentration is a constant struggle\u2014I notice it a lot more than I\u2019d like. The tiredness never really goes away, but I push through because I don\u2019t have much choice. I probably blame myself too much for not handling it better.\nDoctor: You mentioned blaming yourself a lot. How often do you feel worthless or guilty, and how strong are those feelings when they come up?\nPatient: Those feelings hit me several times a week, and they\u2019re hard to shake. They come with a weight I try not to show, but it\u2019s there, loud and persistent. I get stuck blaming myself more than I should, though I know it doesn\u2019t help. I don\u2019t want to go into all of it right now.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy burden to carry, and it takes strength to keep going despite it. I understand not wanting to dig into everything right now\u2014whenever you're ready, we can take it at your pace. You\u2019re not alone in this.\nPatient: It\u2019s exhausting, carrying it all, but I\u2019m still here. I appreciate you letting me set the pace\u2014I\u2019m not ready to unpack everything yet.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing real resilience by staying present through all this. How have your sleep patterns been lately? Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early?\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s been alright, nothing major. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep. Thanks for checking.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any recent changes in your weight or appetite? If so, has that affected your day-to-day life or caused you concern?\nPatient: No changes in weight or appetite. It hasn\u2019t really affected anything.\nDoctor: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently?\nPatient: I\u2019ve thought about death a few times, but it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s just there, I guess.\nDoctor: Can you tell me more about those thoughts\u2014how often they come up and if there\u2019s anything specific that triggers them? Have you thought about any plans or steps, or are these more general feelings? I\u2019m here to listen without judgment, just want to understand so I can support you best.\nPatient: They come up now and then, mostly vague and without any clear trigger. I haven\u2019t made any plans or done anything\u2014just fleeting thoughts that I try not to dwell on. I\u2019m not ready to dig deeper into it yet, but it\u2019s there, and I\u2019m aware of it.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. Have you noticed feeling physically restless or slowed down in your movements or thinking lately?\nPatient: Physically restless or slowed down happens rarely. But my thinking gets slowed more often, making it harder to keep up with tasks sometimes. It\u2019s frustrating, but I manage.\nDoctor: How often does this slowing of thought occur, and how much does it interfere with your concentration and decision-making during the day? Does it affect your ability to handle things like work, studies, or daily responsibilities?\nPatient: Slowed thinking hits me a lot, making it tough to focus or make decisions. It messes with work and daily tasks more than I\u2019d like. I feel like I should be doing better, but I\u2019m stuck anyway.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly frustrating, doing your best but feeling stuck like this. Can you give me some examples of how slowed thinking makes daily tasks or decisions harder? And does this happen most days or just some of the time?\nPatient: Slowed thinking is almost every day now. I struggle to figure out what needs doing first and find myself second-guessing every choice, even small ones. It\u2019s like my brain just won\u2019t cooperate, no matter how much I try. That just makes me blame myself more because I feel like I should be able to handle it better.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn out before, so I want to ask more directly\u2014how often do you feel physically drained or low on energy? Does this fatigue get in the way of your daily activities?\nPatient: Fatigue hits me most days, draining me enough that it slows down everything I need to do. I push through it because I don\u2019t feel like I have a choice, but it\u2019s frustrating not to do better. I blame myself for letting it knock me down so often.\nDoctor: You\u2019re pushing through a lot, and that takes real strength\u2014even if it feels unfair to blame yourself. It makes sense to feel frustrated given how much you\u2019re dealing with, and this is a safe place to share however much you\u2019re ready to.\nPatient: Thanks. I get that I\u2019m strong for keeping at it, but the self-blame won\u2019t let up\u2014it feels so unfair, but I can\u2019t stop. I appreciate this being a space where I don\u2019t have to explain everything yet.\nDoctor: Have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed that. Things that used to feel good don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s frustrating because I keep pushing myself to do them anyway, but it\u2019s just not the same.\nDoctor: Along with the loss of interest, how often do you feel down or depressed? Would you say this mood is present most days?\nPatient: Most days, yeah. The low mood sticks around, shifting but never really going away. It\u2019s exhausting and frustrating to keep fighting it, but I don\u2019t have much choice.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
