Higher symptom severity should show up as more impact on daily life, relationships, or goals. Lower severity should feel milder.\n- Keep trauma and serious adversity realistic and not universal. Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

When you say you feel low and tired most days, can you tell me a bit more about how often that comes up and what it\u2019s like for you during the day? No rush\u2014just whatever you feel comfortable sharing.\nPatient: The fatigue tends to come on mostly during the day. It\u2019s like a constant low energy that doesn\u2019t go away easily. The low mood is there pretty much all the time, but it\u2019s not really strong or overwhelming. Just there.\nDoctor: It sounds like that low energy and mood have been a steady presence for you.

Let\u2019s talk a bit more about your energy and fatigue\u2014how do you feel these are impacting your day-to-day stuff like school, chores, or hanging out with people?\nPatient: The fatigue makes things a bit harder during the day. Schoolwork and chores take more effort, and I\u2019m slower getting things done. It doesn\u2019t stop me, but it\u2019s noticeable. Talking with others feels the same\u2014nothing major, just a bit of extra effort.\nDoctor: That extra effort sounds exhausting, even if it\u2019s not completely stopping you. How does that feeling affect your motivation to start or finish things like schoolwork or chores? And does it change how you feel about those activities afterward?\nPatient: The fatigue does lower my motivation a bit. Starting things takes more effort, and finishing can feel like a chore. Afterward, I just feel kind of drained, but it\u2019s not overwhelming.\nDoctor: It sounds like that tiredness not only makes getting going tougher but also leaves you feeling worn out afterward.

When you say you feel low and tired most days, can you tell me a bit more about how often that comes up and what it\u2019s like for you during the day? No rush\u2014just whatever you feel comfortable sharing.\nPatient: The fatigue tends to come on mostly during the day. It\u2019s like a constant low energy that doesn\u2019t go away easily. The low mood is there pretty much all the time, but it\u2019s not really strong or overwhelming. Just there.\nDoctor: It sounds like that low energy and mood have been a steady presence for you. Have you noticed if the things you normally enjoy\u2014or used to enjoy\u2014feel different these days? Like, are they less interesting or fun than they used to be?\nPatient: Not really. Most things feel pretty much the same. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lost interest in what I usually do.\nDoctor: Thanks for telling me that, Alex.

I don\u2019t have any particular thoughts that stand out or bother me much.\nDoctor: That steady feeling you describe can be really draining in its own way. How have you been sleeping recently? Any changes in your sleep routine, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly the same. Sometimes it\u2019s a little off, but nothing major or frequent.\nDoctor: Got it. Let\u2019s talk a bit more about your energy and fatigue\u2014how do you feel these are impacting your day-to-day stuff like school, chores, or hanging out with people?\nPatient: The fatigue makes things a bit harder during the day. Schoolwork and chores take more effort, and I\u2019m slower getting things done. It doesn\u2019t stop me, but it\u2019s noticeable. Talking with others feels the same\u2014nothing major, just a bit of extra effort.\nDoctor: That extra effort sounds exhausting, even if it\u2019s not completely stopping you. How does that feeling affect your motivation to start or finish things like schoolwork or chores? And does it change how you feel about those activities afterward?\nPatient: The fatigue does lower my motivation a bit. Starting things takes more effort, and finishing can feel like a chore. Afterward, I just feel kind of drained, but it\u2019s not overwhelming.\nDoctor: It sounds like that tiredness not only makes getting going tougher but also leaves you feeling worn out afterward. Do these feelings change much from day to day, or with certain tasks that feel harder or easier?\nPatient: The tiredness is mostly steady day to day. Harder tasks definitely take more energy and feel tougher, but the slow pace stays about the same no matter what.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it helps me understand where you\u2019re at. Sometimes when people feel low and tired like this, they also notice feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Have you had any thoughts like that, even if just a little?

When you say you feel low and tired most days, can you tell me a bit more about how often that comes up and what it\u2019s like for you during the day? No rush\u2014just whatever you feel comfortable sharing.\nPatient: The fatigue tends to come on mostly during the day. It\u2019s like a constant low energy that doesn\u2019t go away easily. The low mood is there pretty much all the time, but it\u2019s not really strong or overwhelming. Just there.\nDoctor: It sounds like that low energy and mood have been a steady presence for you. Have you noticed if the things you normally enjoy\u2014or used to enjoy\u2014feel different these days? Like, are they less interesting or fun than they used to be?\nPatient: Not really. Most things feel pretty much the same. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lost interest in what I usually do.\nDoctor: Thanks for telling me that, Alex. When you say the low mood is there pretty much all the time, are there moments or times when it feels heavier or worse? Or any particular thoughts or feelings that tend to come along with it? I\u2019m here to listen however you\u2019d like to share.\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly steady. I don\u2019t really have moments where it gets worse or better\u2014it just stays kind of low. I don\u2019t have any particular thoughts that stand out or bother me much.\nDoctor: That steady feeling you describe can be really draining in its own way. How have you been sleeping recently? Any changes in your sleep routine, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly the same. Sometimes it\u2019s a little off, but nothing major or frequent.\nDoctor: Got it. Let\u2019s talk a bit more about your energy and fatigue\u2014how do you feel these are impacting your day-to-day stuff like school, chores, or hanging out with people?\nPatient: The fatigue makes things a bit harder during the day. Schoolwork and chores take more effort, and I\u2019m slower getting things done. It doesn\u2019t stop me, but it\u2019s noticeable. Talking with others feels the same\u2014nothing major, just a bit of extra effort.\nDoctor: That extra effort sounds exhausting, even if it\u2019s not completely stopping you. How does that feeling affect your motivation to start or finish things like schoolwork or chores? And does it change how you feel about those activities afterward?\nPatient: The fatigue does lower my motivation a bit. Starting things takes more effort, and finishing can feel like a chore. Afterward, I just feel kind of drained, but it\u2019s not overwhelming.\nDoctor: It sounds like that tiredness not only makes getting going tougher but also leaves you feeling worn out afterward. Do these feelings change much from day to day, or with certain tasks that feel harder or easier?\nPatient: The tiredness is mostly steady day to day. Harder tasks definitely take more energy and feel tougher, but the slow pace stays about the same no matter what.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it helps me understand where you\u2019re at. Sometimes when people feel low and tired like this, they also notice feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Have you had any thoughts like that, even if just a little? It\u2019s okay to be honest here, no judgment at all.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really felt worthless or guilty. Nothing like that.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear, Alex. What about concentrating\u2014have you noticed any trouble focusing on things, like your schoolwork or other tasks? Or maybe finding it harder to make decisions than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s a bit harder to focus sometimes. Deciding things can take a bit longer, but it\u2019s not too bad. Just a bit annoying.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nYeah, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s a bit harder to focus sometimes.

When you say you feel low and tired most days, can you tell me a bit more about how often that comes up and what it\u2019s like for you during the day?

Let\u2019s talk a bit more about your energy and fatigue\u2014how do you feel these are impacting your day-to-day stuff like school, chores, or hanging out with people?\nPatient: The fatigue makes things a bit harder during the day.

When you say you feel low and tired most days, can you tell me a bit more about how often that comes up and what it\u2019s like for you during the day? No rush\u2014just whatever you feel comfortable sharing.\nPatient: The fatigue tends to come on mostly during the day. It\u2019s like a constant low energy that doesn\u2019t go away easily. The low mood is there pretty much all the time, but it\u2019s not really strong or overwhelming. Just there.\nDoctor: It sounds like that low energy and mood have been a steady presence for you. Have you noticed if the things you normally enjoy\u2014or used to enjoy\u2014feel different these days? Like, are they less interesting or fun than they used to be?\nPatient: Not really. Most things feel pretty much the same. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lost interest in what I usually do.\nDoctor: Thanks for telling me that, Alex. When you say the low mood is there pretty much all the time, are there moments or times when it feels heavier or worse? Or any particular thoughts or feelings that tend to come along with it? I\u2019m here to listen however you\u2019d like to share.\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly steady. I don\u2019t really have moments where it gets worse or better\u2014it just stays kind of low. I don\u2019t have any particular thoughts that stand out or bother me much.\nDoctor: That steady feeling you describe can be really draining in its own way. How have you been sleeping recently? Any changes in your sleep routine, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly the same. Sometimes it\u2019s a little off, but nothing major or frequent.\nDoctor: Got it. Let\u2019s talk a bit more about your energy and fatigue\u2014how do you feel these are impacting your day-to-day stuff like school, chores, or hanging out with people?\nPatient: The fatigue makes things a bit harder during the day. Schoolwork and chores take more effort, and I\u2019m slower getting things done. It doesn\u2019t stop me, but it\u2019s noticeable. Talking with others feels the same\u2014nothing major, just a bit of extra effort.\nDoctor: That extra effort sounds exhausting, even if it\u2019s not completely stopping you. How does that feeling affect your motivation to start or finish things like schoolwork or chores? And does it change how you feel about those activities afterward?\nPatient: The fatigue does lower my motivation a bit. Starting things takes more effort, and finishing can feel like a chore. Afterward, I just feel kind of drained, but it\u2019s not overwhelming.\nDoctor: It sounds like that tiredness not only makes getting going tougher but also leaves you feeling worn out afterward. Do these feelings change much from day to day, or with certain tasks that feel harder or easier?\nPatient: The tiredness is mostly steady day to day. Harder tasks definitely take more energy and feel tougher, but the slow pace stays about the same no matter what.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it helps me understand where you\u2019re at. Sometimes when people feel low and tired like this, they also notice feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Have you had any thoughts like that, even if just a little? It\u2019s okay to be honest here, no judgment at all.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really felt worthless or guilty. Nothing like that.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear, Alex. What about concentrating\u2014have you noticed any trouble focusing on things, like your schoolwork or other tasks? Or maybe finding it harder to make decisions than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s a bit harder to focus sometimes. Deciding things can take a bit longer, but it\u2019s not too bad. Just a bit annoying.\nDoctor: That kind of mental fog can be really frustrating, especially when you\u2019re trying to keep up with everything.

When you say you feel low and tired most days, can you tell me a bit more about how often that comes up and what it\u2019s like for you during the day? No rush\u2014just whatever you feel comfortable sharing.\nPatient: The fatigue tends to come on mostly during the day. It\u2019s like a constant low energy that doesn\u2019t go away easily. The low mood is there pretty much all the time, but it\u2019s not really strong or overwhelming. Just there.\nDoctor: It sounds like that low energy and mood have been a steady presence for you. Have you noticed if the things you normally enjoy\u2014or used to enjoy\u2014feel different these days? Like, are they less interesting or fun than they used to be?\nPatient: Not really. Most things feel pretty much the same. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lost interest in what I usually do.\nDoctor: Thanks for telling me that, Alex. When you say the low mood is there pretty much all the time, are there moments or times when it feels heavier or worse? Or any particular thoughts or feelings that tend to come along with it? I\u2019m here to listen however you\u2019d like to share.\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly steady. I don\u2019t really have moments where it gets worse or better\u2014it just stays kind of low. I don\u2019t have any particular thoughts that stand out or bother me much.\nDoctor: That steady feeling you describe can be really draining in its own way. How have you been sleeping recently? Any changes in your sleep routine, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly the same. Sometimes it\u2019s a little off, but nothing major or frequent.\nDoctor: Got it. Let\u2019s talk a bit more about your energy and fatigue\u2014how do you feel these are impacting your day-to-day stuff like school, chores, or hanging out with people?\nPatient: The fatigue makes things a bit harder during the day. Schoolwork and chores take more effort, and I\u2019m slower getting things done. It doesn\u2019t stop me, but it\u2019s noticeable. Talking with others feels the same\u2014nothing major, just a bit of extra effort.\nDoctor: That extra effort sounds exhausting, even if it\u2019s not completely stopping you. How does that feeling affect your motivation to start or finish things like schoolwork or chores? And does it change how you feel about those activities afterward?\nPatient: The fatigue does lower my motivation a bit. Starting things takes more effort, and finishing can feel like a chore. Afterward, I just feel kind of drained, but it\u2019s not overwhelming.\nDoctor: It sounds like that tiredness not only makes getting going tougher but also leaves you feeling worn out afterward. Do these feelings change much from day to day, or with certain tasks that feel harder or easier?\nPatient: The tiredness is mostly steady day to day. Harder tasks definitely take more energy and feel tougher, but the slow pace stays about the same no matter what.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it helps me understand where you\u2019re at. Sometimes when people feel low and tired like this, they also notice feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Have you had any thoughts like that, even if just a little? It\u2019s okay to be honest here, no judgment at all.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really felt worthless or guilty. Nothing like that.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear, Alex. What about concentrating\u2014have you noticed any trouble focusing on things, like your schoolwork or other tasks? Or maybe finding it harder to make decisions than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s a bit harder to focus sometimes. Deciding things can take a bit longer, but it\u2019s not too bad. Just a bit annoying.\nDoctor: That kind of mental fog can be really frustrating, especially when you\u2019re trying to keep up with everything. How do these moments with focus or decision-making affect your day or how you\u2019re feeling overall? If you want, feel free to tell me more about what that\u2019s like.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely frustrating sometimes. The slower focus and decision-making annoy me, but I manage to get through most days without too much trouble.\nDoctor: I hear the frustration, Alex\u2014it\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing through when your mind feels slowed down like that. It really shows a lot of grit that you\u2019re managing most days despite how annoying it can be. That kind of resilience isn\u2019t easy to come by.\nPatient: Thanks.

When you say you feel low and tired most days, can you tell me a bit more about how often that comes up and what it\u2019s like for you during the day? No rush\u2014just whatever you feel comfortable sharing.\nPatient: The fatigue tends to come on mostly during the day. It\u2019s like a constant low energy that doesn\u2019t go away easily. The low mood is there pretty much all the time, but it\u2019s not really strong or overwhelming. Just there.\nDoctor: It sounds like that low energy and mood have been a steady presence for you. Have you noticed if the things you normally enjoy\u2014or used to enjoy\u2014feel different these days? Like, are they less interesting or fun than they used to be?\nPatient: Not really. Most things feel pretty much the same. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lost interest in what I usually do.\nDoctor: Thanks for telling me that, Alex.

I don\u2019t have any particular thoughts that stand out or bother me much.\nDoctor: That steady feeling you describe can be really draining in its own way. How have you been sleeping recently? Any changes in your sleep routine, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly the same. Sometimes it\u2019s a little off, but nothing major or frequent.\nDoctor: Got it. Let\u2019s talk a bit more about your energy and fatigue\u2014how do you feel these are impacting your day-to-day stuff like school, chores, or hanging out with people?\nPatient: The fatigue makes things a bit harder during the day. Schoolwork and chores take more effort, and I\u2019m slower getting things done. It doesn\u2019t stop me, but it\u2019s noticeable. Talking with others feels the same\u2014nothing major, just a bit of extra effort.\nDoctor: That extra effort sounds exhausting, even if it\u2019s not completely stopping you. How does that feeling affect your motivation to start or finish things like schoolwork or chores? And does it change how you feel about those activities afterward?\nPatient: The fatigue does lower my motivation a bit. Starting things takes more effort, and finishing can feel like a chore. Afterward, I just feel kind of drained, but it\u2019s not overwhelming.\nDoctor: It sounds like that tiredness not only makes getting going tougher but also leaves you feeling worn out afterward. Do these feelings change much from day to day, or with certain tasks that feel harder or easier?\nPatient: The tiredness is mostly steady day to day. Harder tasks definitely take more energy and feel tougher, but the slow pace stays about the same no matter what.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it helps me understand where you\u2019re at. Sometimes when people feel low and tired like this, they also notice feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Have you had any thoughts like that, even if just a little? It\u2019s okay to be honest here, no judgment at all.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really felt worthless or guilty. Nothing like that.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear, Alex. What about concentrating\u2014have you noticed any trouble focusing on things, like your schoolwork or other tasks? Or maybe finding it harder to make decisions than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s a bit harder to focus sometimes. Deciding things can take a bit longer, but it\u2019s not too bad. Just a bit annoying.\nDoctor: That kind of mental fog can be really frustrating, especially when you\u2019re trying to keep up with everything. How do these moments with focus or decision-making affect your day or how you\u2019re feeling overall? If you want, feel free to tell me more about what that\u2019s like.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely frustrating sometimes. The slower focus and decision-making annoy me, but I manage to get through most days without too much trouble.\nDoctor: I hear the frustration, Alex\u2014it\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing through when your mind feels slowed down like that. It really shows a lot of grit that you\u2019re managing most days despite how annoying it can be. That kind of resilience isn\u2019t easy to come by.\nPatient: Thanks. It\u2019s frustrating, but I keep going. The slowing down and feeling a bit on edge are still there, but I handle it.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling a bit on edge and slowed down\u2014have you noticed if you\u2019re more fidgety or restless than usual? Or maybe the opposite, like moving or talking slower than you normally do?\nPatient: Yeah, sometimes I\u2019m a bit restless or fidgety.

Or maybe finding it harder to make decisions than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s a bit harder to focus sometimes. Deciding things can take a bit longer, but it\u2019s not too bad. Just a bit annoying.\nDoctor: That kind of mental fog can be really frustrating, especially when you\u2019re trying to keep up with everything. How do these moments with focus or decision-making affect your day or how you\u2019re feeling overall? If you want, feel free to tell me more about what that\u2019s like.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely frustrating sometimes. The slower focus and decision-making annoy me, but I manage to get through most days without too much trouble.\nDoctor: I hear the frustration, Alex\u2014it\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing through when your mind feels slowed down like that. It really shows a lot of grit that you\u2019re managing most days despite how annoying it can be. That kind of resilience isn\u2019t easy to come by.\nPatient: Thanks. It\u2019s frustrating, but I keep going. The slowing down and feeling a bit on edge are still there, but I handle it.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling a bit on edge and slowed down\u2014have you noticed if you\u2019re more fidgety or restless than usual? Or maybe the opposite, like moving or talking slower than you normally do?\nPatient: Yeah, sometimes I\u2019m a bit restless or fidgety. The slowing down in how I move or talk is there too, but it\u2019s not really that noticeable or bad.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. Thinking about your mood overall, how often would you say you feel really down or depressed? And when those feelings come up, how strong or intense do they usually feel for you?\nPatient: I feel down pretty often, but it\u2019s not really intense. Mostly it\u2019s just a steady low feeling that sticks around.\nDoctor: That steady low feeling sounds like a weight that\u2019s always there. Does it change at all during the day, or with certain things that happen? How does it affect the way you\u2019re with other people or the things you have to do? I\u2019m here to listen to whatever feels right to share.\nPatient: It stays pretty steady all day, doesn\u2019t change much.

When you say you feel low and tired most days, can you tell me a bit more about how often that comes up and what it\u2019s like for you during the day? No rush\u2014just whatever you feel comfortable sharing.\nPatient: The fatigue tends to come on mostly during the day. It\u2019s like a constant low energy that doesn\u2019t go away easily. The low mood is there pretty much all the time, but it\u2019s not really strong or overwhelming. Just there.\nDoctor: It sounds like that low energy and mood have been a steady presence for you. Have you noticed if the things you normally enjoy\u2014or used to enjoy\u2014feel different these days? Like, are they less interesting or fun than they used to be?\nPatient: Not really. Most things feel pretty much the same. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lost interest in what I usually do.\nDoctor: Thanks for telling me that, Alex.

Any changes in your sleep routine, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly the same. Sometimes it\u2019s a little off, but nothing major or frequent.\nDoctor: Got it. Let\u2019s talk a bit more about your energy and fatigue\u2014how do you feel these are impacting your day-to-day stuff like school, chores, or hanging out with people?\nPatient: The fatigue makes things a bit harder during the day. Schoolwork and chores take more effort, and I\u2019m slower getting things done. It doesn\u2019t stop me, but it\u2019s noticeable. Talking with others feels the same\u2014nothing major, just a bit of extra effort.\nDoctor: That extra effort sounds exhausting, even if it\u2019s not completely stopping you. How does that feeling affect your motivation to start or finish things like schoolwork or chores? And does it change how you feel about those activities afterward?\nPatient: The fatigue does lower my motivation a bit. Starting things takes more effort, and finishing can feel like a chore. Afterward, I just feel kind of drained, but it\u2019s not overwhelming.\nDoctor: It sounds like that tiredness not only makes getting going tougher but also leaves you feeling worn out afterward. Do these feelings change much from day to day, or with certain tasks that feel harder or easier?\nPatient: The tiredness is mostly steady day to day. Harder tasks definitely take more energy and feel tougher, but the slow pace stays about the same no matter what.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it helps me understand where you\u2019re at. Sometimes when people feel low and tired like this, they also notice feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Have you had any thoughts like that, even if just a little? It\u2019s okay to be honest here, no judgment at all.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really felt worthless or guilty. Nothing like that.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear, Alex.

How does that feeling affect your motivation to start or finish things like schoolwork or chores? And does it change how you feel about those activities afterward?\nPatient: The fatigue does lower my motivation a bit. Starting things takes more effort, and finishing can feel like a chore. Afterward, I just feel kind of drained, but it\u2019s not overwhelming.\nDoctor: It sounds like that tiredness not only makes getting going tougher but also leaves you feeling worn out afterward. Do these feelings change much from day to day, or with certain tasks that feel harder or easier?\nPatient: The tiredness is mostly steady day to day. Harder tasks definitely take more energy and feel tougher, but the slow pace stays about the same no matter what.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it helps me understand where you\u2019re at. Sometimes when people feel low and tired like this, they also notice feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Have you had any thoughts like that, even if just a little? It\u2019s okay to be honest here, no judgment at all.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really felt worthless or guilty. Nothing like that.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear, Alex. What about concentrating\u2014have you noticed any trouble focusing on things, like your schoolwork or other tasks? Or maybe finding it harder to make decisions than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s a bit harder to focus sometimes. Deciding things can take a bit longer, but it\u2019s not too bad. Just a bit annoying.\nDoctor: That kind of mental fog can be really frustrating, especially when you\u2019re trying to keep up with everything. How do these moments with focus or decision-making affect your day or how you\u2019re feeling overall? If you want, feel free to tell me more about what that\u2019s like.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely frustrating sometimes. The slower focus and decision-making annoy me, but I manage to get through most days without too much trouble.\nDoctor: I hear the frustration, Alex\u2014it\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing through when your mind feels slowed down like that. It really shows a lot of grit that you\u2019re managing most days despite how annoying it can be. That kind of resilience isn\u2019t easy to come by.\nPatient: Thanks. It\u2019s frustrating, but I keep going. The slowing down and feeling a bit on edge are still there, but I handle it.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling a bit on edge and slowed down\u2014have you noticed if you\u2019re more fidgety or restless than usual? Or maybe the opposite, like moving or talking slower than you normally do?\nPatient: Yeah, sometimes I\u2019m a bit restless or fidgety. The slowing down in how I move or talk is there too, but it\u2019s not really that noticeable or bad.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. Thinking about your mood overall, how often would you say you feel really down or depressed? And when those feelings come up, how strong or intense do they usually feel for you?\nPatient: I feel down pretty often, but it\u2019s not really intense. Mostly it\u2019s just a steady low feeling that sticks around.\nDoctor: That steady low feeling sounds like a weight that\u2019s always there. Does it change at all during the day, or with certain things that happen? How does it affect the way you\u2019re with other people or the things you have to do? I\u2019m here to listen to whatever feels right to share.\nPatient: It stays pretty steady all day, doesn\u2019t change much. When I\u2019m with others, it doesn\u2019t really affect me much, but doing daily tasks takes more energy than before. Still manageable, though.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. How about your appetite\u2014have you been eating more or less than usual lately? Any changes in your weight that you\u2019ve noticed?\nPatient: No, my appetite\u2019s about the same.

When you say you feel low and tired most days, can you tell me a bit more about how often that comes up and what it\u2019s like for you during the day? No rush\u2014just whatever you feel comfortable sharing.\nPatient: The fatigue tends to come on mostly during the day. It\u2019s like a constant low energy that doesn\u2019t go away easily. The low mood is there pretty much all the time, but it\u2019s not really strong or overwhelming. Just there.\nDoctor: It sounds like that low energy and mood have been a steady presence for you.

Let\u2019s talk a bit more about your energy and fatigue\u2014how do you feel these are impacting your day-to-day stuff like school, chores, or hanging out with people?\nPatient: The fatigue makes things a bit harder during the day. Schoolwork and chores take more effort, and I\u2019m slower getting things done. It doesn\u2019t stop me, but it\u2019s noticeable.

Most things feel pretty much the same. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lost interest in what I usually do.\nDoctor: Thanks for telling me that, Alex. When you say the low mood is there pretty much all the time, are there moments or times when it feels heavier or worse? Or any particular thoughts or feelings that tend to come along with it? I\u2019m here to listen however you\u2019d like to share.\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly steady. I don\u2019t really have moments where it gets worse or better\u2014it just stays kind of low. I don\u2019t have any particular thoughts that stand out or bother me much.\nDoctor: That steady feeling you describe can be really draining in its own way. How have you been sleeping recently? Any changes in your sleep routine, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly the same. Sometimes it\u2019s a little off, but nothing major or frequent.\nDoctor: Got it. Let\u2019s talk a bit more about your energy and fatigue\u2014how do you feel these are impacting your day-to-day stuff like school, chores, or hanging out with people?\nPatient: The fatigue makes things a bit harder during the day. Schoolwork and chores take more effort, and I\u2019m slower getting things done. It doesn\u2019t stop me, but it\u2019s noticeable. Talking with others feels the same\u2014nothing major, just a bit of extra effort.\nDoctor: That extra effort sounds exhausting, even if it\u2019s not completely stopping you. How does that feeling affect your motivation to start or finish things like schoolwork or chores? And does it change how you feel about those activities afterward?\nPatient: The fatigue does lower my motivation a bit. Starting things takes more effort, and finishing can feel like a chore. Afterward, I just feel kind of drained, but it\u2019s not overwhelming.\nDoctor: It sounds like that tiredness not only makes getting going tougher but also leaves you feeling worn out afterward. Do these feelings change much from day to day, or with certain tasks that feel harder or easier?\nPatient: The tiredness is mostly steady day to day. Harder tasks definitely take more energy and feel tougher, but the slow pace stays about the same no matter what.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it helps me understand where you\u2019re at. Sometimes when people feel low and tired like this, they also notice feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Have you had any thoughts like that, even if just a little? It\u2019s okay to be honest here, no judgment at all.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really felt worthless or guilty. Nothing like that.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear, Alex. What about concentrating\u2014have you noticed any trouble focusing on things, like your schoolwork or other tasks? Or maybe finding it harder to make decisions than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s a bit harder to focus sometimes. Deciding things can take a bit longer, but it\u2019s not too bad. Just a bit annoying.\nDoctor: That kind of mental fog can be really frustrating, especially when you\u2019re trying to keep up with everything. How do these moments with focus or decision-making affect your day or how you\u2019re feeling overall? If you want, feel free to tell me more about what that\u2019s like.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely frustrating sometimes. The slower focus and decision-making annoy me, but I manage to get through most days without too much trouble.\nDoctor: I hear the frustration, Alex\u2014it\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing through when your mind feels slowed down like that. It really shows a lot of grit that you\u2019re managing most days despite how annoying it can be. That kind of resilience isn\u2019t easy to come by.\nPatient: Thanks. It\u2019s frustrating, but I keep going. The slowing down and feeling a bit on edge are still there, but I handle it.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling a bit on edge and slowed down\u2014have you noticed if you\u2019re more fidgety or restless than usual? Or maybe the opposite, like moving or talking slower than you normally do?\nPatient: Yeah, sometimes I\u2019m a bit restless or fidgety. The slowing down in how I move or talk is there too, but it\u2019s not really that noticeable or bad.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. Thinking about your mood overall, how often would you say you feel really down or depressed? And when those feelings come up, how strong or intense do they usually feel for you?\nPatient: I feel down pretty often, but it\u2019s not really intense. Mostly it\u2019s just a steady low feeling that sticks around.\nDoctor: That steady low feeling sounds like a weight that\u2019s always there. Does it change at all during the day, or with certain things that happen? How does it affect the way you\u2019re with other people or the things you have to do? I\u2019m here to listen to whatever feels right to share.\nPatient: It stays pretty steady all day, doesn\u2019t change much. When I\u2019m with others, it doesn\u2019t really affect me much, but doing daily tasks takes more energy than before. Still manageable, though.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. How about your appetite\u2014have you been eating more or less than usual lately? Any changes in your weight that you\u2019ve noticed?\nPatient: No, my appetite\u2019s about the same. No changes in weight either.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear your appetite and weight haven\u2019t changed. Sometimes when people feel low for a while, they might have thoughts about death or suicide\u2014even if they don\u2019t want to act on them. Have you had any thoughts like that, Alex? It\u2019s completely okay to be open here, and I\u2019m here to support you.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
