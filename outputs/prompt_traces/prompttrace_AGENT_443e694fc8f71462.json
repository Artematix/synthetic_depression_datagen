Higher symptom severity should show up as more impact on daily life, relationships, or goals. Lower severity should feel milder.\n- Keep trauma and serious adversity realistic and not universal. Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

Since feeling down and tired are affecting you regularly, I\u2019m curious\u2014have you noticed if things you usually enjoy, like hobbies or spending time with friends, feel less interesting or fun lately?\nPatient: Actually, my hobbies and spending time with friends feel about the same as usual. I haven\u2019t really noticed any change in how much I enjoy those things, even though I do feel down and tired.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear you\u2019re still enjoying those parts of your life. With the down mood and tiredness you mentioned, how do those feelings play out during your day-to-day activities\u2014like school or chores? Do they make it harder to get things done or stay motivated in any way?\nPatient: Feeling down and tired definitely makes things like schoolwork and chores harder. I usually still manage to get them done, but it takes more effort than before, and it can feel pretty draining sometimes.\nDoctor: Got it. Would you say this tiredness feels different from typical tiredness\u2014like, is it overwhelming or persistent even after resting? And how much does it interfere with your ability to focus or keep up with your daily routines?\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness feels a bit different\u2014like it stays around even after I\u2019ve rested. It can be somewhat overwhelming at times, and it does make focusing and keeping up with daily tasks a bit harder, but I\u2019m still able to manage most things.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How has your sleep been lately\u2014do you have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: My sleep is usually okay overall. Sometimes it takes me a little longer to fall asleep, but I don\u2019t often have trouble staying asleep. Occasionally, I wake up feeling a bit tired or not fully rested, but it\u2019s not every day.\nDoctor: Thank you for that. Can you tell me how your mood feels during the day?

Every now and then, I have moments where I feel worthless, but it\u2019s not constant.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. How often would you say you\u2019re feeling down or really tired\u2014like, is it most days, or more occasional? And when you mention feeling worthless, can you tell me what\u2019s happening during those times and how strong those feelings get for you?\nPatient: I\u2019d say feeling down happens on most days, and the tiredness is pretty frequent too, even when I\u2019ve had enough sleep. The feelings of worthlessness come up now and then, but they\u2019re usually mild and often after small setbacks. They don\u2019t get too intense most of the time.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. Since feeling down and tired are affecting you regularly, I\u2019m curious\u2014have you noticed if things you usually enjoy, like hobbies or spending time with friends, feel less interesting or fun lately?\nPatient: Actually, my hobbies and spending time with friends feel about the same as usual. I haven\u2019t really noticed any change in how much I enjoy those things, even though I do feel down and tired.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear you\u2019re still enjoying those parts of your life. With the down mood and tiredness you mentioned, how do those feelings play out during your day-to-day activities\u2014like school or chores? Do they make it harder to get things done or stay motivated in any way?\nPatient: Feeling down and tired definitely makes things like schoolwork and chores harder. I usually still manage to get them done, but it takes more effort than before, and it can feel pretty draining sometimes.\nDoctor: Got it. Would you say this tiredness feels different from typical tiredness\u2014like, is it overwhelming or persistent even after resting? And how much does it interfere with your ability to focus or keep up with your daily routines?\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness feels a bit different\u2014like it stays around even after I\u2019ve rested. It can be somewhat overwhelming at times, and it does make focusing and keeping up with daily tasks a bit harder, but I\u2019m still able to manage most things.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How has your sleep been lately\u2014do you have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: My sleep is usually okay overall. Sometimes it takes me a little longer to fall asleep, but I don\u2019t often have trouble staying asleep. Occasionally, I wake up feeling a bit tired or not fully rested, but it\u2019s not every day.\nDoctor: Thank you for that. Can you tell me how your mood feels during the day? Do you experience times of sadness or emptiness that stick with you for a while?\nPatient: During the day, I do feel sad or empty at times, but it\u2019s not usually constant. It tends to come and go rather than being there all the time.\nDoctor: That sounds tough. When these feelings come on, how long do they usually last?

Every now and then, I have moments where I feel worthless, but it\u2019s not constant.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. How often would you say you\u2019re feeling down or really tired\u2014like, is it most days, or more occasional? And when you mention feeling worthless, can you tell me what\u2019s happening during those times and how strong those feelings get for you?\nPatient: I\u2019d say feeling down happens on most days, and the tiredness is pretty frequent too, even when I\u2019ve had enough sleep. The feelings of worthlessness come up now and then, but they\u2019re usually mild and often after small setbacks. They don\u2019t get too intense most of the time.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. Since feeling down and tired are affecting you regularly, I\u2019m curious\u2014have you noticed if things you usually enjoy, like hobbies or spending time with friends, feel less interesting or fun lately?\nPatient: Actually, my hobbies and spending time with friends feel about the same as usual. I haven\u2019t really noticed any change in how much I enjoy those things, even though I do feel down and tired.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear you\u2019re still enjoying those parts of your life. With the down mood and tiredness you mentioned, how do those feelings play out during your day-to-day activities\u2014like school or chores? Do they make it harder to get things done or stay motivated in any way?\nPatient: Feeling down and tired definitely makes things like schoolwork and chores harder. I usually still manage to get them done, but it takes more effort than before, and it can feel pretty draining sometimes.\nDoctor: Got it. Would you say this tiredness feels different from typical tiredness\u2014like, is it overwhelming or persistent even after resting? And how much does it interfere with your ability to focus or keep up with your daily routines?\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness feels a bit different\u2014like it stays around even after I\u2019ve rested. It can be somewhat overwhelming at times, and it does make focusing and keeping up with daily tasks a bit harder, but I\u2019m still able to manage most things.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How has your sleep been lately\u2014do you have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: My sleep is usually okay overall. Sometimes it takes me a little longer to fall asleep, but I don\u2019t often have trouble staying asleep. Occasionally, I wake up feeling a bit tired or not fully rested, but it\u2019s not every day.\nDoctor: Thank you for that. Can you tell me how your mood feels during the day? Do you experience times of sadness or emptiness that stick with you for a while?\nPatient: During the day, I do feel sad or empty at times, but it\u2019s not usually constant. It tends to come and go rather than being there all the time.\nDoctor: That sounds tough. When these feelings come on, how long do they usually last? Are there particular things or situations that tend to trigger or worsen those moments of sadness or emptiness?\nPatient: Those feelings usually last for a limited time and don\u2019t last all day. They seem to come on more after stress or small setbacks, but most of the time they fade away rather than stick around.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying that. When you feel those moments of worthlessness after setbacks, how often would you say they happen? And how much do they affect what you do or how you feel throughout the day?\nPatient: Those feelings of worthlessness don\u2019t happen very often, mostly after small setbacks.

Every now and then, I have moments where I feel worthless, but it\u2019s not constant.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. How often would you say you\u2019re feeling down or really tired\u2014like, is it most days, or more occasional? And when you mention feeling worthless, can you tell me what\u2019s happening during those times and how strong those feelings get for you?\nPatient: I\u2019d say feeling down happens on most days, and the tiredness is pretty frequent too, even when I\u2019ve had enough sleep. The feelings of worthlessness come up now and then, but they\u2019re usually mild and often after small setbacks. They don\u2019t get too intense most of the time.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. Since feeling down and tired are affecting you regularly, I\u2019m curious\u2014have you noticed if things you usually enjoy, like hobbies or spending time with friends, feel less interesting or fun lately?\nPatient: Actually, my hobbies and spending time with friends feel about the same as usual. I haven\u2019t really noticed any change in how much I enjoy those things, even though I do feel down and tired.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear you\u2019re still enjoying those parts of your life. With the down mood and tiredness you mentioned, how do those feelings play out during your day-to-day activities\u2014like school or chores? Do they make it harder to get things done or stay motivated in any way?\nPatient: Feeling down and tired definitely makes things like schoolwork and chores harder. I usually still manage to get them done, but it takes more effort than before, and it can feel pretty draining sometimes.\nDoctor: Got it. Would you say this tiredness feels different from typical tiredness\u2014like, is it overwhelming or persistent even after resting? And how much does it interfere with your ability to focus or keep up with your daily routines?\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness feels a bit different\u2014like it stays around even after I\u2019ve rested. It can be somewhat overwhelming at times, and it does make focusing and keeping up with daily tasks a bit harder, but I\u2019m still able to manage most things.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How has your sleep been lately\u2014do you have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: My sleep is usually okay overall. Sometimes it takes me a little longer to fall asleep, but I don\u2019t often have trouble staying asleep. Occasionally, I wake up feeling a bit tired or not fully rested, but it\u2019s not every day.\nDoctor: Thank you for that. Can you tell me how your mood feels during the day? Do you experience times of sadness or emptiness that stick with you for a while?\nPatient: During the day, I do feel sad or empty at times, but it\u2019s not usually constant. It tends to come and go rather than being there all the time.\nDoctor: That sounds tough. When these feelings come on, how long do they usually last? Are there particular things or situations that tend to trigger or worsen those moments of sadness or emptiness?\nPatient: Those feelings usually last for a limited time and don\u2019t last all day. They seem to come on more after stress or small setbacks, but most of the time they fade away rather than stick around.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying that. When you feel those moments of worthlessness after setbacks, how often would you say they happen? And how much do they affect what you do or how you feel throughout the day?\nPatient: Those feelings of worthlessness don\u2019t happen very often, mostly after small setbacks. They\u2019re usually pretty mild and don\u2019t really affect my daily activities or mood much. They tend to pass without much lasting impact.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of worthlessness can be hard when they come up, but it\u2019s clear you\u2019ve been managing them without letting them take over your day. That takes a lot of strength, and it\u2019s completely normal to have tough moments\u2014I'm here to help you through them.\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that.

And how much does it interfere with your ability to focus or keep up with your daily routines?\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness feels a bit different\u2014like it stays around even after I\u2019ve rested. It can be somewhat overwhelming at times, and it does make focusing and keeping up with daily tasks a bit harder, but I\u2019m still able to manage most things.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How has your sleep been lately\u2014do you have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: My sleep is usually okay overall. Sometimes it takes me a little longer to fall asleep, but I don\u2019t often have trouble staying asleep. Occasionally, I wake up feeling a bit tired or not fully rested, but it\u2019s not every day.\nDoctor: Thank you for that. Can you tell me how your mood feels during the day? Do you experience times of sadness or emptiness that stick with you for a while?\nPatient: During the day, I do feel sad or empty at times, but it\u2019s not usually constant. It tends to come and go rather than being there all the time.\nDoctor: That sounds tough. When these feelings come on, how long do they usually last? Are there particular things or situations that tend to trigger or worsen those moments of sadness or emptiness?\nPatient: Those feelings usually last for a limited time and don\u2019t last all day. They seem to come on more after stress or small setbacks, but most of the time they fade away rather than stick around.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying that. When you feel those moments of worthlessness after setbacks, how often would you say they happen? And how much do they affect what you do or how you feel throughout the day?\nPatient: Those feelings of worthlessness don\u2019t happen very often, mostly after small setbacks. They\u2019re usually pretty mild and don\u2019t really affect my daily activities or mood much. They tend to pass without much lasting impact.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of worthlessness can be hard when they come up, but it\u2019s clear you\u2019ve been managing them without letting them take over your day. That takes a lot of strength, and it\u2019s completely normal to have tough moments\u2014I'm here to help you through them.\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. I\u2019m trying to handle these feelings the best I can, and it helps knowing there\u2019s support available.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad you\u2019re finding some comfort in support\u2014that\u2019s important. Since you\u2019re working hard to manage these feelings, I want to check in about any changes in your appetite or weight lately.

And when you mention feeling worthless, can you tell me what\u2019s happening during those times and how strong those feelings get for you?\nPatient: I\u2019d say feeling down happens on most days, and the tiredness is pretty frequent too, even when I\u2019ve had enough sleep. The feelings of worthlessness come up now and then, but they\u2019re usually mild and often after small setbacks. They don\u2019t get too intense most of the time.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. Since feeling down and tired are affecting you regularly, I\u2019m curious\u2014have you noticed if things you usually enjoy, like hobbies or spending time with friends, feel less interesting or fun lately?\nPatient: Actually, my hobbies and spending time with friends feel about the same as usual. I haven\u2019t really noticed any change in how much I enjoy those things, even though I do feel down and tired.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear you\u2019re still enjoying those parts of your life. With the down mood and tiredness you mentioned, how do those feelings play out during your day-to-day activities\u2014like school or chores? Do they make it harder to get things done or stay motivated in any way?\nPatient: Feeling down and tired definitely makes things like schoolwork and chores harder. I usually still manage to get them done, but it takes more effort than before, and it can feel pretty draining sometimes.\nDoctor: Got it. Would you say this tiredness feels different from typical tiredness\u2014like, is it overwhelming or persistent even after resting? And how much does it interfere with your ability to focus or keep up with your daily routines?\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness feels a bit different\u2014like it stays around even after I\u2019ve rested. It can be somewhat overwhelming at times, and it does make focusing and keeping up with daily tasks a bit harder, but I\u2019m still able to manage most things.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How has your sleep been lately\u2014do you have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: My sleep is usually okay overall. Sometimes it takes me a little longer to fall asleep, but I don\u2019t often have trouble staying asleep. Occasionally, I wake up feeling a bit tired or not fully rested, but it\u2019s not every day.\nDoctor: Thank you for that. Can you tell me how your mood feels during the day? Do you experience times of sadness or emptiness that stick with you for a while?\nPatient: During the day, I do feel sad or empty at times, but it\u2019s not usually constant. It tends to come and go rather than being there all the time.\nDoctor: That sounds tough. When these feelings come on, how long do they usually last? Are there particular things or situations that tend to trigger or worsen those moments of sadness or emptiness?\nPatient: Those feelings usually last for a limited time and don\u2019t last all day. They seem to come on more after stress or small setbacks, but most of the time they fade away rather than stick around.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying that. When you feel those moments of worthlessness after setbacks, how often would you say they happen? And how much do they affect what you do or how you feel throughout the day?\nPatient: Those feelings of worthlessness don\u2019t happen very often, mostly after small setbacks. They\u2019re usually pretty mild and don\u2019t really affect my daily activities or mood much.

Every now and then, I have moments where I feel worthless, but it\u2019s not constant.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. How often would you say you\u2019re feeling down or really tired\u2014like, is it most days, or more occasional? And when you mention feeling worthless, can you tell me what\u2019s happening during those times and how strong those feelings get for you?\nPatient: I\u2019d say feeling down happens on most days, and the tiredness is pretty frequent too, even when I\u2019ve had enough sleep. The feelings of worthlessness come up now and then, but they\u2019re usually mild and often after small setbacks. They don\u2019t get too intense most of the time.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. Since feeling down and tired are affecting you regularly, I\u2019m curious\u2014have you noticed if things you usually enjoy, like hobbies or spending time with friends, feel less interesting or fun lately?\nPatient: Actually, my hobbies and spending time with friends feel about the same as usual. I haven\u2019t really noticed any change in how much I enjoy those things, even though I do feel down and tired.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear you\u2019re still enjoying those parts of your life. With the down mood and tiredness you mentioned, how do those feelings play out during your day-to-day activities\u2014like school or chores? Do they make it harder to get things done or stay motivated in any way?\nPatient: Feeling down and tired definitely makes things like schoolwork and chores harder. I usually still manage to get them done, but it takes more effort than before, and it can feel pretty draining sometimes.\nDoctor: Got it. Would you say this tiredness feels different from typical tiredness\u2014like, is it overwhelming or persistent even after resting? And how much does it interfere with your ability to focus or keep up with your daily routines?\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness feels a bit different\u2014like it stays around even after I\u2019ve rested. It can be somewhat overwhelming at times, and it does make focusing and keeping up with daily tasks a bit harder, but I\u2019m still able to manage most things.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How has your sleep been lately\u2014do you have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: My sleep is usually okay overall. Sometimes it takes me a little longer to fall asleep, but I don\u2019t often have trouble staying asleep. Occasionally, I wake up feeling a bit tired or not fully rested, but it\u2019s not every day.\nDoctor: Thank you for that. Can you tell me how your mood feels during the day? Do you experience times of sadness or emptiness that stick with you for a while?\nPatient: During the day, I do feel sad or empty at times, but it\u2019s not usually constant. It tends to come and go rather than being there all the time.\nDoctor: That sounds tough. When these feelings come on, how long do they usually last? Are there particular things or situations that tend to trigger or worsen those moments of sadness or emptiness?\nPatient: Those feelings usually last for a limited time and don\u2019t last all day. They seem to come on more after stress or small setbacks, but most of the time they fade away rather than stick around.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying that. When you feel those moments of worthlessness after setbacks, how often would you say they happen? And how much do they affect what you do or how you feel throughout the day?\nPatient: Those feelings of worthlessness don\u2019t happen very often, mostly after small setbacks. They\u2019re usually pretty mild and don\u2019t really affect my daily activities or mood much. They tend to pass without much lasting impact.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of worthlessness can be hard when they come up, but it\u2019s clear you\u2019ve been managing them without letting them take over your day. That takes a lot of strength, and it\u2019s completely normal to have tough moments\u2014I'm here to help you through them.\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. I\u2019m trying to handle these feelings the best I can, and it helps knowing there\u2019s support available.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad you\u2019re finding some comfort in support\u2014that\u2019s important.

How often would you say you\u2019re feeling down or really tired\u2014like, is it most days, or more occasional? And when you mention feeling worthless, can you tell me what\u2019s happening during those times and how strong those feelings get for you?\nPatient: I\u2019d say feeling down happens on most days, and the tiredness is pretty frequent too, even when I\u2019ve had enough sleep. The feelings of worthlessness come up now and then, but they\u2019re usually mild and often after small setbacks. They don\u2019t get too intense most of the time.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. Since feeling down and tired are affecting you regularly, I\u2019m curious\u2014have you noticed if things you usually enjoy, like hobbies or spending time with friends, feel less interesting or fun lately?\nPatient: Actually, my hobbies and spending time with friends feel about the same as usual. I haven\u2019t really noticed any change in how much I enjoy those things, even though I do feel down and tired.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear you\u2019re still enjoying those parts of your life. With the down mood and tiredness you mentioned, how do those feelings play out during your day-to-day activities\u2014like school or chores? Do they make it harder to get things done or stay motivated in any way?\nPatient: Feeling down and tired definitely makes things like schoolwork and chores harder. I usually still manage to get them done, but it takes more effort than before, and it can feel pretty draining sometimes.\nDoctor: Got it. Would you say this tiredness feels different from typical tiredness\u2014like, is it overwhelming or persistent even after resting? And how much does it interfere with your ability to focus or keep up with your daily routines?\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness feels a bit different\u2014like it stays around even after I\u2019ve rested. It can be somewhat overwhelming at times, and it does make focusing and keeping up with daily tasks a bit harder, but I\u2019m still able to manage most things.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How has your sleep been lately\u2014do you have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: My sleep is usually okay overall. Sometimes it takes me a little longer to fall asleep, but I don\u2019t often have trouble staying asleep. Occasionally, I wake up feeling a bit tired or not fully rested, but it\u2019s not every day.\nDoctor: Thank you for that. Can you tell me how your mood feels during the day? Do you experience times of sadness or emptiness that stick with you for a while?\nPatient: During the day, I do feel sad or empty at times, but it\u2019s not usually constant. It tends to come and go rather than being there all the time.\nDoctor: That sounds tough. When these feelings come on, how long do they usually last? Are there particular things or situations that tend to trigger or worsen those moments of sadness or emptiness?\nPatient: Those feelings usually last for a limited time and don\u2019t last all day. They seem to come on more after stress or small setbacks, but most of the time they fade away rather than stick around.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying that. When you feel those moments of worthlessness after setbacks, how often would you say they happen? And how much do they affect what you do or how you feel throughout the day?\nPatient: Those feelings of worthlessness don\u2019t happen very often, mostly after small setbacks. They\u2019re usually pretty mild and don\u2019t really affect my daily activities or mood much. They tend to pass without much lasting impact.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of worthlessness can be hard when they come up, but it\u2019s clear you\u2019ve been managing them without letting them take over your day. That takes a lot of strength, and it\u2019s completely normal to have tough moments\u2014I'm here to help you through them.\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that.

During those times, schoolwork can feel a bit harder, but it\u2019s manageable.\nDoctor: I appreciate you being open about that.

Every now and then, I have moments where I feel worthless, but it\u2019s not constant.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. How often would you say you\u2019re feeling down or really tired\u2014like, is it most days, or more occasional? And when you mention feeling worthless, can you tell me what\u2019s happening during those times and how strong those feelings get for you?\nPatient: I\u2019d say feeling down happens on most days, and the tiredness is pretty frequent too, even when I\u2019ve had enough sleep. The feelings of worthlessness come up now and then, but they\u2019re usually mild and often after small setbacks. They don\u2019t get too intense most of the time.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. Since feeling down and tired are affecting you regularly, I\u2019m curious\u2014have you noticed if things you usually enjoy, like hobbies or spending time with friends, feel less interesting or fun lately?\nPatient: Actually, my hobbies and spending time with friends feel about the same as usual. I haven\u2019t really noticed any change in how much I enjoy those things, even though I do feel down and tired.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear you\u2019re still enjoying those parts of your life. With the down mood and tiredness you mentioned, how do those feelings play out during your day-to-day activities\u2014like school or chores? Do they make it harder to get things done or stay motivated in any way?\nPatient: Feeling down and tired definitely makes things like schoolwork and chores harder. I usually still manage to get them done, but it takes more effort than before, and it can feel pretty draining sometimes.\nDoctor: Got it. Would you say this tiredness feels different from typical tiredness\u2014like, is it overwhelming or persistent even after resting? And how much does it interfere with your ability to focus or keep up with your daily routines?\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness feels a bit different\u2014like it stays around even after I\u2019ve rested. It can be somewhat overwhelming at times, and it does make focusing and keeping up with daily tasks a bit harder, but I\u2019m still able to manage most things.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How has your sleep been lately\u2014do you have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: My sleep is usually okay overall. Sometimes it takes me a little longer to fall asleep, but I don\u2019t often have trouble staying asleep. Occasionally, I wake up feeling a bit tired or not fully rested, but it\u2019s not every day.\nDoctor: Thank you for that. Can you tell me how your mood feels during the day? Do you experience times of sadness or emptiness that stick with you for a while?\nPatient: During the day, I do feel sad or empty at times, but it\u2019s not usually constant. It tends to come and go rather than being there all the time.\nDoctor: That sounds tough. When these feelings come on, how long do they usually last? Are there particular things or situations that tend to trigger or worsen those moments of sadness or emptiness?\nPatient: Those feelings usually last for a limited time and don\u2019t last all day. They seem to come on more after stress or small setbacks, but most of the time they fade away rather than stick around.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying that. When you feel those moments of worthlessness after setbacks, how often would you say they happen? And how much do they affect what you do or how you feel throughout the day?\nPatient: Those feelings of worthlessness don\u2019t happen very often, mostly after small setbacks. They\u2019re usually pretty mild and don\u2019t really affect my daily activities or mood much. They tend to pass without much lasting impact.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of worthlessness can be hard when they come up, but it\u2019s clear you\u2019ve been managing them without letting them take over your day. That takes a lot of strength, and it\u2019s completely normal to have tough moments\u2014I'm here to help you through them.\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. I\u2019m trying to handle these feelings the best I can, and it helps knowing there\u2019s support available.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad you\u2019re finding some comfort in support\u2014that\u2019s important.

And how much do they affect what you do or how you feel throughout the day?\nPatient: Those feelings of worthlessness don\u2019t happen very often, mostly after small setbacks. They\u2019re usually pretty mild and don\u2019t really affect my daily activities or mood much. They tend to pass without much lasting impact.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of worthlessness can be hard when they come up, but it\u2019s clear you\u2019ve been managing them without letting them take over your day. That takes a lot of strength, and it\u2019s completely normal to have tough moments\u2014I'm here to help you through them.\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. I\u2019m trying to handle these feelings the best I can, and it helps knowing there\u2019s support available.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad you\u2019re finding some comfort in support\u2014that\u2019s important. Since you\u2019re working hard to manage these feelings, I want to check in about any changes in your appetite or weight lately. Have you noticed anything different in that area?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in my appetite or weight recently. Things have stayed about the same.\nDoctor: Got it. How about feeling physically slower or restless, or having trouble concentrating or making decisions lately? Have you noticed anything like that?\nPatient: Sometimes I have a little trouble concentrating or making decisions, but it\u2019s pretty rare. I haven\u2019t noticed feeling physically slower or restless.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. When you do have trouble concentrating or deciding, can you tell me what\u2019s going on around those times? How long do those moments usually last, and do they make any particular tasks\u2014like schoolwork\u2014more difficult?\nPatient: Those moments don\u2019t happen very often, and when they do, they\u2019re usually pretty short. During those times, schoolwork can feel a bit harder, but it\u2019s manageable.\nDoctor: I appreciate you being open about that. I want to check in on something important\u2014have you ever found yourself having thoughts about death or suicide, even if just briefly? It\u2019s okay to talk about, and I\u2019m here to listen without judgment.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts about death or suicide. I do have some difficult feelings, but I\u2019m managing and trying to cope as best I can.\nDoctor: That\u2019s really good to hear, and I appreciate you being honest with me. Managing difficult feelings like this takes a lot of resilience, and reaching out for support is a strong and important step. Remember, I\u2019m here whenever you need help or just someone to talk to.\nPatient: Thank you. I appreciate the support, and I\u2019m doing my best to cope with everything. It helps knowing there\u2019s someone to talk to.\nDoctor: You\u2019re definitely not alone in this. What you\u2019re doing\u2014being open and reaching out\u2014really matters.

And when you mention feeling worthless, can you tell me what\u2019s happening during those times and how strong those feelings get for you?\nPatient: I\u2019d say feeling down happens on most days, and the tiredness is pretty frequent too, even when I\u2019ve had enough sleep. The feelings of worthlessness come up now and then, but they\u2019re usually mild and often after small setbacks. They don\u2019t get too intense most of the time.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. Since feeling down and tired are affecting you regularly, I\u2019m curious\u2014have you noticed if things you usually enjoy, like hobbies or spending time with friends, feel less interesting or fun lately?\nPatient: Actually, my hobbies and spending time with friends feel about the same as usual. I haven\u2019t really noticed any change in how much I enjoy those things, even though I do feel down and tired.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear you\u2019re still enjoying those parts of your life. With the down mood and tiredness you mentioned, how do those feelings play out during your day-to-day activities\u2014like school or chores? Do they make it harder to get things done or stay motivated in any way?\nPatient: Feeling down and tired definitely makes things like schoolwork and chores harder. I usually still manage to get them done, but it takes more effort than before, and it can feel pretty draining sometimes.\nDoctor: Got it. Would you say this tiredness feels different from typical tiredness\u2014like, is it overwhelming or persistent even after resting? And how much does it interfere with your ability to focus or keep up with your daily routines?\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness feels a bit different\u2014like it stays around even after I\u2019ve rested. It can be somewhat overwhelming at times, and it does make focusing and keeping up with daily tasks a bit harder, but I\u2019m still able to manage most things.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How has your sleep been lately\u2014do you have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: My sleep is usually okay overall. Sometimes it takes me a little longer to fall asleep, but I don\u2019t often have trouble staying asleep. Occasionally, I wake up feeling a bit tired or not fully rested, but it\u2019s not every day.\nDoctor: Thank you for that. Can you tell me how your mood feels during the day? Do you experience times of sadness or emptiness that stick with you for a while?\nPatient: During the day, I do feel sad or empty at times, but it\u2019s not usually constant. It tends to come and go rather than being there all the time.\nDoctor: That sounds tough. When these feelings come on, how long do they usually last? Are there particular things or situations that tend to trigger or worsen those moments of sadness or emptiness?\nPatient: Those feelings usually last for a limited time and don\u2019t last all day. They seem to come on more after stress or small setbacks, but most of the time they fade away rather than stick around.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying that.

And how much does it interfere with your ability to focus or keep up with your daily routines?\nPatient: Yeah, the tiredness feels a bit different\u2014like it stays around even after I\u2019ve rested. It can be somewhat overwhelming at times, and it does make focusing and keeping up with daily tasks a bit harder, but I\u2019m still able to manage most things.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How has your sleep been lately\u2014do you have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: My sleep is usually okay overall. Sometimes it takes me a little longer to fall asleep, but I don\u2019t often have trouble staying asleep. Occasionally, I wake up feeling a bit tired or not fully rested, but it\u2019s not every day.\nDoctor: Thank you for that. Can you tell me how your mood feels during the day? Do you experience times of sadness or emptiness that stick with you for a while?\nPatient: During the day, I do feel sad or empty at times, but it\u2019s not usually constant. It tends to come and go rather than being there all the time.\nDoctor: That sounds tough. When these feelings come on, how long do they usually last? Are there particular things or situations that tend to trigger or worsen those moments of sadness or emptiness?\nPatient: Those feelings usually last for a limited time and don\u2019t last all day. They seem to come on more after stress or small setbacks, but most of the time they fade away rather than stick around.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying that. When you feel those moments of worthlessness after setbacks, how often would you say they happen? And how much do they affect what you do or how you feel throughout the day?\nPatient: Those feelings of worthlessness don\u2019t happen very often, mostly after small setbacks. They\u2019re usually pretty mild and don\u2019t really affect my daily activities or mood much. They tend to pass without much lasting impact.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of worthlessness can be hard when they come up, but it\u2019s clear you\u2019ve been managing them without letting them take over your day. That takes a lot of strength, and it\u2019s completely normal to have tough moments\u2014I'm here to help you through them.\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. I\u2019m trying to handle these feelings the best I can, and it helps knowing there\u2019s support available.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad you\u2019re finding some comfort in support\u2014that\u2019s important. Since you\u2019re working hard to manage these feelings, I want to check in about any changes in your appetite or weight lately. Have you noticed anything different in that area?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in my appetite or weight recently. Things have stayed about the same.\nDoctor: Got it. How about feeling physically slower or restless, or having trouble concentrating or making decisions lately? Have you noticed anything like that?\nPatient: Sometimes I have a little trouble concentrating or making decisions, but it\u2019s pretty rare. I haven\u2019t noticed feeling physically slower or restless.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. When you do have trouble concentrating or deciding, can you tell me what\u2019s going on around those times? How long do those moments usually last, and do they make any particular tasks\u2014like schoolwork\u2014more difficult?\nPatient: Those moments don\u2019t happen very often, and when they do, they\u2019re usually pretty short. During those times, schoolwork can feel a bit harder, but it\u2019s manageable.\nDoctor: I appreciate you being open about that. I want to check in on something important\u2014have you ever found yourself having thoughts about death or suicide, even if just briefly? It\u2019s okay to talk about, and I\u2019m here to listen without judgment.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts about death or suicide. I do have some difficult feelings, but I\u2019m managing and trying to cope as best I can.\nDoctor: That\u2019s really good to hear, and I appreciate you being honest with me. Managing difficult feelings like this takes a lot of resilience, and reaching out for support is a strong and important step. Remember, I\u2019m here whenever you need help or just someone to talk to.\nPatient: Thank you. I appreciate the support, and I\u2019m doing my best to cope with everything. It helps knowing there\u2019s someone to talk to.\nDoctor: You\u2019re definitely not alone in this. What you\u2019re doing\u2014being open and reaching out\u2014really matters. Whenever you need support, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out; we\u2019re here for you.\nPatient: Thank you. It means a lot to know that support is available when I need it.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad that knowing support is here helps. Since difficulties with concentration and decision-making can be tiring, can you tell me if these moments ever feel overwhelming or affect how you manage your schoolwork or daily choices?\nPatient: Those moments with concentration or decisions don\u2019t happen often, and when they do, they\u2019re usually manageable. They don\u2019t really feel overwhelming or cause major problems with schoolwork or daily choices.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
