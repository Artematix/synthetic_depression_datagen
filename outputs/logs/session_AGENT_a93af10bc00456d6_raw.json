Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work.

Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax.

Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling.

Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way.

I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting.

At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck.

Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should.

This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work.

Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused.

I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nIt\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back.

How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough. Even though my motivation dips because of this, I still try to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting.

At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work.

Can you tell me more about the times when concentrating or making decisions feels especially hard? How do these moments affect your day-to-day life and how you see yourself?\nPatient: When the fatigue and restlessness are at their worst, concentrating or making even simple decisions feels almost impossible.

Those moments pile up and make everything feel overwhelming, which then feeds into this growing self-doubt\u2014like I\u2019m not capable of handling even basic tasks.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough. Even though my motivation dips because of this, I still try to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught between wanting to keep going and feeling worn down at the same time.\nDoctor: It sounds really exhausting to be caught between wanting to keep going and feeling so worn down. Can you tell me more about the times when concentrating or making decisions feels especially hard? How do these moments affect your day-to-day life and how you see yourself?\nPatient: When the fatigue and restlessness are at their worst, concentrating or making even simple decisions feels almost impossible. It\u2019s like my mind gets foggy or stuck, and I can\u2019t just move forward with what needs doing. Those moments pile up and make everything feel overwhelming, which then feeds into this growing self-doubt\u2014like I\u2019m not capable of handling even basic tasks. It\u2019s frustrating to feel trapped between trying hard and being worn down at the same time. Some days it\u2019s just a constant battle to keep myself functioning at all.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly tough\u2014feeling stuck in that fog and overwhelmed by even the simplest decisions, all while wrestling with self-doubt. It\u2019s completely understandable to find that frustrating and draining. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen more about what those days are like for you or anything else you want to share about this experience.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat sounds incredibly tough\u2014feeling stuck in that fog and overwhelmed by even the simplest decisions, all while wrestling with self-doubt.

Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough. Even though my motivation dips because of this, I still try to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught between wanting to keep going and feeling worn down at the same time.\nDoctor: It sounds really exhausting to be caught between wanting to keep going and feeling so worn down. Can you tell me more about the times when concentrating or making decisions feels especially hard? How do these moments affect your day-to-day life and how you see yourself?\nPatient: When the fatigue and restlessness are at their worst, concentrating or making even simple decisions feels almost impossible. It\u2019s like my mind gets foggy or stuck, and I can\u2019t just move forward with what needs doing. Those moments pile up and make everything feel overwhelming, which then feeds into this growing self-doubt\u2014like I\u2019m not capable of handling even basic tasks. It\u2019s frustrating to feel trapped between trying hard and being worn down at the same time. Some days it\u2019s just a constant battle to keep myself functioning at all.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly tough\u2014feeling stuck in that fog and overwhelmed by even the simplest decisions, all while wrestling with self-doubt. It\u2019s completely understandable to find that frustrating and draining. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen more about what those days are like for you or anything else you want to share about this experience.\nPatient: Those bad days feel like my mind is just wrapped in a thick fog. It\u2019s not just hard to think clearly\u2014it\u2019s like everything slows down or gets tangled, and making even the smallest decision becomes overwhelming. Choosing what to eat or what to focus on feels like a huge task. All that indecisiveness just builds this weight of self-doubt, making me question if I\u2019m capable of handling even the basics. The frustration piles up because I\u2019m putting in so much effort just to stay functioning, but it often feels like I\u2019m running on empty. It\u2019s exhausting to constantly fight through this fog and doubt, but somehow I keep trying to push forward, even when it\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nThose bad days feel like my mind is just wrapped in a thick fog.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling.

It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough. Even though my motivation dips because of this, I still try to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught between wanting to keep going and feeling worn down at the same time.\nDoctor: It sounds really exhausting to be caught between wanting to keep going and feeling so worn down. Can you tell me more about the times when concentrating or making decisions feels especially hard? How do these moments affect your day-to-day life and how you see yourself?\nPatient: When the fatigue and restlessness are at their worst, concentrating or making even simple decisions feels almost impossible. It\u2019s like my mind gets foggy or stuck, and I can\u2019t just move forward with what needs doing. Those moments pile up and make everything feel overwhelming, which then feeds into this growing self-doubt\u2014like I\u2019m not capable of handling even basic tasks. It\u2019s frustrating to feel trapped between trying hard and being worn down at the same time. Some days it\u2019s just a constant battle to keep myself functioning at all.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly tough\u2014feeling stuck in that fog and overwhelmed by even the simplest decisions, all while wrestling with self-doubt. It\u2019s completely understandable to find that frustrating and draining. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen more about what those days are like for you or anything else you want to share about this experience.\nPatient: Those bad days feel like my mind is just wrapped in a thick fog. It\u2019s not just hard to think clearly\u2014it\u2019s like everything slows down or gets tangled, and making even the smallest decision becomes overwhelming. Choosing what to eat or what to focus on feels like a huge task. All that indecisiveness just builds this weight of self-doubt, making me question if I\u2019m capable of handling even the basics. The frustration piles up because I\u2019m putting in so much effort just to stay functioning, but it often feels like I\u2019m running on empty. It\u2019s exhausting to constantly fight through this fog and doubt, but somehow I keep trying to push forward, even when it\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\nDoctor: Thank you for trusting me with how hard this has been for you.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity.

Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough. Even though my motivation dips because of this, I still try to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught between wanting to keep going and feeling worn down at the same time.\nDoctor: It sounds really exhausting to be caught between wanting to keep going and feeling so worn down. Can you tell me more about the times when concentrating or making decisions feels especially hard? How do these moments affect your day-to-day life and how you see yourself?\nPatient: When the fatigue and restlessness are at their worst, concentrating or making even simple decisions feels almost impossible. It\u2019s like my mind gets foggy or stuck, and I can\u2019t just move forward with what needs doing. Those moments pile up and make everything feel overwhelming, which then feeds into this growing self-doubt\u2014like I\u2019m not capable of handling even basic tasks. It\u2019s frustrating to feel trapped between trying hard and being worn down at the same time. Some days it\u2019s just a constant battle to keep myself functioning at all.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly tough\u2014feeling stuck in that fog and overwhelmed by even the simplest decisions, all while wrestling with self-doubt. It\u2019s completely understandable to find that frustrating and draining. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen more about what those days are like for you or anything else you want to share about this experience.\nPatient: Those bad days feel like my mind is just wrapped in a thick fog. It\u2019s not just hard to think clearly\u2014it\u2019s like everything slows down or gets tangled, and making even the smallest decision becomes overwhelming. Choosing what to eat or what to focus on feels like a huge task. All that indecisiveness just builds this weight of self-doubt, making me question if I\u2019m capable of handling even the basics. The frustration piles up because I\u2019m putting in so much effort just to stay functioning, but it often feels like I\u2019m running on empty. It\u2019s exhausting to constantly fight through this fog and doubt, but somehow I keep trying to push forward, even when it\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\nDoctor: Thank you for trusting me with how hard this has been for you. It\u2019s clear how much strength it takes just to keep pushing through when your mind feels so foggy and overwhelmed, and that effort truly matters. It\u2019s okay to feel exhausted by all of this\u2014you\u2019re doing the best you can in a really tough situation. When you\u2019re ready, we can keep talking through everything together.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that\u2014it means a lot to hear that support. It\u2019s definitely still a struggle most days, trying to push through the mental fog and fatigue. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m making progress, and other times it just feels like the exhaustion is taking over again. But I\u2019m trying to stay consistent and keep moving forward, even if it\u2019s slow or difficult. Having someone to talk to about it helps, so thank you.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a lot of resilience in pushing forward even when things feel overwhelming, and it\u2019s good to hear that talking about it helps a bit.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough. Even though my motivation dips because of this, I still try to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught between wanting to keep going and feeling worn down at the same time.\nDoctor: It sounds really exhausting to be caught between wanting to keep going and feeling so worn down. Can you tell me more about the times when concentrating or making decisions feels especially hard? How do these moments affect your day-to-day life and how you see yourself?\nPatient: When the fatigue and restlessness are at their worst, concentrating or making even simple decisions feels almost impossible. It\u2019s like my mind gets foggy or stuck, and I can\u2019t just move forward with what needs doing. Those moments pile up and make everything feel overwhelming, which then feeds into this growing self-doubt\u2014like I\u2019m not capable of handling even basic tasks. It\u2019s frustrating to feel trapped between trying hard and being worn down at the same time. Some days it\u2019s just a constant battle to keep myself functioning at all.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly tough\u2014feeling stuck in that fog and overwhelmed by even the simplest decisions, all while wrestling with self-doubt. It\u2019s completely understandable to find that frustrating and draining. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen more about what those days are like for you or anything else you want to share about this experience.\nPatient: Those bad days feel like my mind is just wrapped in a thick fog. It\u2019s not just hard to think clearly\u2014it\u2019s like everything slows down or gets tangled, and making even the smallest decision becomes overwhelming. Choosing what to eat or what to focus on feels like a huge task. All that indecisiveness just builds this weight of self-doubt, making me question if I\u2019m capable of handling even the basics. The frustration piles up because I\u2019m putting in so much effort just to stay functioning, but it often feels like I\u2019m running on empty. It\u2019s exhausting to constantly fight through this fog and doubt, but somehow I keep trying to push forward, even when it\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\nDoctor: Thank you for trusting me with how hard this has been for you. It\u2019s clear how much strength it takes just to keep pushing through when your mind feels so foggy and overwhelmed, and that effort truly matters. It\u2019s okay to feel exhausted by all of this\u2014you\u2019re doing the best you can in a really tough situation. When you\u2019re ready, we can keep talking through everything together.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that\u2014it means a lot to hear that support. It\u2019s definitely still a struggle most days, trying to push through the mental fog and fatigue. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m making progress, and other times it just feels like the exhaustion is taking over again. But I\u2019m trying to stay consistent and keep moving forward, even if it\u2019s slow or difficult. Having someone to talk to about it helps, so thank you.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a lot of resilience in pushing forward even when things feel overwhelming, and it\u2019s good to hear that talking about it helps a bit. Sometimes, when people deal with this kind of exhaustion and fog, feelings of worthlessness or guilt can come up\u2014do you find yourself experiencing thoughts like that? If so, how do they affect you?\nPatient: Yes, I do experience feelings of worthlessness and guilt from time to time. They mostly come from doubting myself\u2014wondering if I\u2019m doing enough or if I\u2019m capable of keeping up with everything I need to handle. It\u2019s frustrating because these feelings weigh on me, but they\u2019re not constant or overwhelming. I think the fatigue and mental fog complicate how I feel emotionally, making everything feel more layered and difficult to sort through.

I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough. Even though my motivation dips because of this, I still try to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught between wanting to keep going and feeling worn down at the same time.\nDoctor: It sounds really exhausting to be caught between wanting to keep going and feeling so worn down. Can you tell me more about the times when concentrating or making decisions feels especially hard? How do these moments affect your day-to-day life and how you see yourself?\nPatient: When the fatigue and restlessness are at their worst, concentrating or making even simple decisions feels almost impossible. It\u2019s like my mind gets foggy or stuck, and I can\u2019t just move forward with what needs doing. Those moments pile up and make everything feel overwhelming, which then feeds into this growing self-doubt\u2014like I\u2019m not capable of handling even basic tasks. It\u2019s frustrating to feel trapped between trying hard and being worn down at the same time. Some days it\u2019s just a constant battle to keep myself functioning at all.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly tough\u2014feeling stuck in that fog and overwhelmed by even the simplest decisions, all while wrestling with self-doubt. It\u2019s completely understandable to find that frustrating and draining. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen more about what those days are like for you or anything else you want to share about this experience.\nPatient: Those bad days feel like my mind is just wrapped in a thick fog. It\u2019s not just hard to think clearly\u2014it\u2019s like everything slows down or gets tangled, and making even the smallest decision becomes overwhelming. Choosing what to eat or what to focus on feels like a huge task. All that indecisiveness just builds this weight of self-doubt, making me question if I\u2019m capable of handling even the basics. The frustration piles up because I\u2019m putting in so much effort just to stay functioning, but it often feels like I\u2019m running on empty. It\u2019s exhausting to constantly fight through this fog and doubt, but somehow I keep trying to push forward, even when it\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\nDoctor: Thank you for trusting me with how hard this has been for you. It\u2019s clear how much strength it takes just to keep pushing through when your mind feels so foggy and overwhelmed, and that effort truly matters. It\u2019s okay to feel exhausted by all of this\u2014you\u2019re doing the best you can in a really tough situation. When you\u2019re ready, we can keep talking through everything together.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that\u2014it means a lot to hear that support. It\u2019s definitely still a struggle most days, trying to push through the mental fog and fatigue. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m making progress, and other times it just feels like the exhaustion is taking over again. But I\u2019m trying to stay consistent and keep moving forward, even if it\u2019s slow or difficult. Having someone to talk to about it helps, so thank you.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a lot of resilience in pushing forward even when things feel overwhelming, and it\u2019s good to hear that talking about it helps a bit. Sometimes, when people deal with this kind of exhaustion and fog, feelings of worthlessness or guilt can come up\u2014do you find yourself experiencing thoughts like that? If so, how do they affect you?\nPatient: Yes, I do experience feelings of worthlessness and guilt from time to time. They mostly come from doubting myself\u2014wondering if I\u2019m doing enough or if I\u2019m capable of keeping up with everything I need to handle. It\u2019s frustrating because these feelings weigh on me, but they\u2019re not constant or overwhelming. I think the fatigue and mental fog complicate how I feel emotionally, making everything feel more layered and difficult to sort through. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m aware of these feelings and try to keep them in perspective as best I can.\nDoctor: You have a lot of insight into how these feelings show up for you, and that self-awareness is really important\u2014even when it doesn\u2019t make things easy. It makes sense that fatigue and mental fog can make emotions feel more tangled and hard to sort out. What you\u2019re feeling is valid, and it\u2019s okay to have these struggles while still working through them.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough. Even though my motivation dips because of this, I still try to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught between wanting to keep going and feeling worn down at the same time.\nDoctor: It sounds really exhausting to be caught between wanting to keep going and feeling so worn down. Can you tell me more about the times when concentrating or making decisions feels especially hard? How do these moments affect your day-to-day life and how you see yourself?\nPatient: When the fatigue and restlessness are at their worst, concentrating or making even simple decisions feels almost impossible. It\u2019s like my mind gets foggy or stuck, and I can\u2019t just move forward with what needs doing. Those moments pile up and make everything feel overwhelming, which then feeds into this growing self-doubt\u2014like I\u2019m not capable of handling even basic tasks. It\u2019s frustrating to feel trapped between trying hard and being worn down at the same time. Some days it\u2019s just a constant battle to keep myself functioning at all.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly tough\u2014feeling stuck in that fog and overwhelmed by even the simplest decisions, all while wrestling with self-doubt. It\u2019s completely understandable to find that frustrating and draining. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen more about what those days are like for you or anything else you want to share about this experience.\nPatient: Those bad days feel like my mind is just wrapped in a thick fog. It\u2019s not just hard to think clearly\u2014it\u2019s like everything slows down or gets tangled, and making even the smallest decision becomes overwhelming. Choosing what to eat or what to focus on feels like a huge task. All that indecisiveness just builds this weight of self-doubt, making me question if I\u2019m capable of handling even the basics. The frustration piles up because I\u2019m putting in so much effort just to stay functioning, but it often feels like I\u2019m running on empty. It\u2019s exhausting to constantly fight through this fog and doubt, but somehow I keep trying to push forward, even when it\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\nDoctor: Thank you for trusting me with how hard this has been for you. It\u2019s clear how much strength it takes just to keep pushing through when your mind feels so foggy and overwhelmed, and that effort truly matters. It\u2019s okay to feel exhausted by all of this\u2014you\u2019re doing the best you can in a really tough situation. When you\u2019re ready, we can keep talking through everything together.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that\u2014it means a lot to hear that support. It\u2019s definitely still a struggle most days, trying to push through the mental fog and fatigue. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m making progress, and other times it just feels like the exhaustion is taking over again. But I\u2019m trying to stay consistent and keep moving forward, even if it\u2019s slow or difficult. Having someone to talk to about it helps, so thank you.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a lot of resilience in pushing forward even when things feel overwhelming, and it\u2019s good to hear that talking about it helps a bit. Sometimes, when people deal with this kind of exhaustion and fog, feelings of worthlessness or guilt can come up\u2014do you find yourself experiencing thoughts like that? If so, how do they affect you?\nPatient: Yes, I do experience feelings of worthlessness and guilt from time to time. They mostly come from doubting myself\u2014wondering if I\u2019m doing enough or if I\u2019m capable of keeping up with everything I need to handle. It\u2019s frustrating because these feelings weigh on me, but they\u2019re not constant or overwhelming. I think the fatigue and mental fog complicate how I feel emotionally, making everything feel more layered and difficult to sort through. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m aware of these feelings and try to keep them in perspective as best I can.\nDoctor: You have a lot of insight into how these feelings show up for you, and that self-awareness is really important\u2014even when it doesn\u2019t make things easy. It makes sense that fatigue and mental fog can make emotions feel more tangled and hard to sort out. What you\u2019re feeling is valid, and it\u2019s okay to have these struggles while still working through them. I\u2019m here to support you as you keep navigating all of this.\nPatient: Thank you, I really appreciate that. Having support like this makes a difference, even when things feel tough. I know the fatigue and mental fog aren\u2019t going away overnight, but I\u2019m determined to keep working through it and managing what I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m trying to stay focused on moving forward and not letting all of this hold me back completely.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough. Even though my motivation dips because of this, I still try to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught between wanting to keep going and feeling worn down at the same time.\nDoctor: It sounds really exhausting to be caught between wanting to keep going and feeling so worn down. Can you tell me more about the times when concentrating or making decisions feels especially hard? How do these moments affect your day-to-day life and how you see yourself?\nPatient: When the fatigue and restlessness are at their worst, concentrating or making even simple decisions feels almost impossible. It\u2019s like my mind gets foggy or stuck, and I can\u2019t just move forward with what needs doing. Those moments pile up and make everything feel overwhelming, which then feeds into this growing self-doubt\u2014like I\u2019m not capable of handling even basic tasks. It\u2019s frustrating to feel trapped between trying hard and being worn down at the same time. Some days it\u2019s just a constant battle to keep myself functioning at all.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly tough\u2014feeling stuck in that fog and overwhelmed by even the simplest decisions, all while wrestling with self-doubt. It\u2019s completely understandable to find that frustrating and draining. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen more about what those days are like for you or anything else you want to share about this experience.\nPatient: Those bad days feel like my mind is just wrapped in a thick fog. It\u2019s not just hard to think clearly\u2014it\u2019s like everything slows down or gets tangled, and making even the smallest decision becomes overwhelming. Choosing what to eat or what to focus on feels like a huge task. All that indecisiveness just builds this weight of self-doubt, making me question if I\u2019m capable of handling even the basics. The frustration piles up because I\u2019m putting in so much effort just to stay functioning, but it often feels like I\u2019m running on empty. It\u2019s exhausting to constantly fight through this fog and doubt, but somehow I keep trying to push forward, even when it\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\nDoctor: Thank you for trusting me with how hard this has been for you. It\u2019s clear how much strength it takes just to keep pushing through when your mind feels so foggy and overwhelmed, and that effort truly matters. It\u2019s okay to feel exhausted by all of this\u2014you\u2019re doing the best you can in a really tough situation. When you\u2019re ready, we can keep talking through everything together.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that\u2014it means a lot to hear that support. It\u2019s definitely still a struggle most days, trying to push through the mental fog and fatigue. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m making progress, and other times it just feels like the exhaustion is taking over again. But I\u2019m trying to stay consistent and keep moving forward, even if it\u2019s slow or difficult. Having someone to talk to about it helps, so thank you.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a lot of resilience in pushing forward even when things feel overwhelming, and it\u2019s good to hear that talking about it helps a bit. Sometimes, when people deal with this kind of exhaustion and fog, feelings of worthlessness or guilt can come up\u2014do you find yourself experiencing thoughts like that? If so, how do they affect you?\nPatient: Yes, I do experience feelings of worthlessness and guilt from time to time. They mostly come from doubting myself\u2014wondering if I\u2019m doing enough or if I\u2019m capable of keeping up with everything I need to handle. It\u2019s frustrating because these feelings weigh on me, but they\u2019re not constant or overwhelming. I think the fatigue and mental fog complicate how I feel emotionally, making everything feel more layered and difficult to sort through. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m aware of these feelings and try to keep them in perspective as best I can.\nDoctor: You have a lot of insight into how these feelings show up for you, and that self-awareness is really important\u2014even when it doesn\u2019t make things easy. It makes sense that fatigue and mental fog can make emotions feel more tangled and hard to sort out. What you\u2019re feeling is valid, and it\u2019s okay to have these struggles while still working through them. I\u2019m here to support you as you keep navigating all of this.\nPatient: Thank you, I really appreciate that. Having support like this makes a difference, even when things feel tough. I know the fatigue and mental fog aren\u2019t going away overnight, but I\u2019m determined to keep working through it and managing what I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m trying to stay focused on moving forward and not letting all of this hold me back completely. Having someone to talk to helps keep me grounded and motivated to keep going.\nDoctor: I\u2019m really glad to hear that having this space to talk helps you stay grounded and motivated. Sometimes during stressful times or emotional ups and downs, changes in appetite or weight can happen too\u2014have you noticed anything like that lately? Understanding these details can help us get a clearer picture of how you\u2019ve been feeling overall.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nI\u2019m really glad to hear that having this space to talk helps you stay grounded and motivated.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough. Even though my motivation dips because of this, I still try to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught between wanting to keep going and feeling worn down at the same time.\nDoctor: It sounds really exhausting to be caught between wanting to keep going and feeling so worn down. Can you tell me more about the times when concentrating or making decisions feels especially hard? How do these moments affect your day-to-day life and how you see yourself?\nPatient: When the fatigue and restlessness are at their worst, concentrating or making even simple decisions feels almost impossible. It\u2019s like my mind gets foggy or stuck, and I can\u2019t just move forward with what needs doing. Those moments pile up and make everything feel overwhelming, which then feeds into this growing self-doubt\u2014like I\u2019m not capable of handling even basic tasks. It\u2019s frustrating to feel trapped between trying hard and being worn down at the same time. Some days it\u2019s just a constant battle to keep myself functioning at all.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly tough\u2014feeling stuck in that fog and overwhelmed by even the simplest decisions, all while wrestling with self-doubt. It\u2019s completely understandable to find that frustrating and draining. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen more about what those days are like for you or anything else you want to share about this experience.\nPatient: Those bad days feel like my mind is just wrapped in a thick fog. It\u2019s not just hard to think clearly\u2014it\u2019s like everything slows down or gets tangled, and making even the smallest decision becomes overwhelming. Choosing what to eat or what to focus on feels like a huge task. All that indecisiveness just builds this weight of self-doubt, making me question if I\u2019m capable of handling even the basics. The frustration piles up because I\u2019m putting in so much effort just to stay functioning, but it often feels like I\u2019m running on empty. It\u2019s exhausting to constantly fight through this fog and doubt, but somehow I keep trying to push forward, even when it\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\nDoctor: Thank you for trusting me with how hard this has been for you. It\u2019s clear how much strength it takes just to keep pushing through when your mind feels so foggy and overwhelmed, and that effort truly matters. It\u2019s okay to feel exhausted by all of this\u2014you\u2019re doing the best you can in a really tough situation. When you\u2019re ready, we can keep talking through everything together.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that\u2014it means a lot to hear that support. It\u2019s definitely still a struggle most days, trying to push through the mental fog and fatigue. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m making progress, and other times it just feels like the exhaustion is taking over again. But I\u2019m trying to stay consistent and keep moving forward, even if it\u2019s slow or difficult. Having someone to talk to about it helps, so thank you.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a lot of resilience in pushing forward even when things feel overwhelming, and it\u2019s good to hear that talking about it helps a bit. Sometimes, when people deal with this kind of exhaustion and fog, feelings of worthlessness or guilt can come up\u2014do you find yourself experiencing thoughts like that? If so, how do they affect you?\nPatient: Yes, I do experience feelings of worthlessness and guilt from time to time. They mostly come from doubting myself\u2014wondering if I\u2019m doing enough or if I\u2019m capable of keeping up with everything I need to handle. It\u2019s frustrating because these feelings weigh on me, but they\u2019re not constant or overwhelming. I think the fatigue and mental fog complicate how I feel emotionally, making everything feel more layered and difficult to sort through. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m aware of these feelings and try to keep them in perspective as best I can.\nDoctor: You have a lot of insight into how these feelings show up for you, and that self-awareness is really important\u2014even when it doesn\u2019t make things easy. It makes sense that fatigue and mental fog can make emotions feel more tangled and hard to sort out. What you\u2019re feeling is valid, and it\u2019s okay to have these struggles while still working through them. I\u2019m here to support you as you keep navigating all of this.\nPatient: Thank you, I really appreciate that. Having support like this makes a difference, even when things feel tough.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough. Even though my motivation dips because of this, I still try to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught between wanting to keep going and feeling worn down at the same time.\nDoctor: It sounds really exhausting to be caught between wanting to keep going and feeling so worn down. Can you tell me more about the times when concentrating or making decisions feels especially hard? How do these moments affect your day-to-day life and how you see yourself?\nPatient: When the fatigue and restlessness are at their worst, concentrating or making even simple decisions feels almost impossible. It\u2019s like my mind gets foggy or stuck, and I can\u2019t just move forward with what needs doing. Those moments pile up and make everything feel overwhelming, which then feeds into this growing self-doubt\u2014like I\u2019m not capable of handling even basic tasks. It\u2019s frustrating to feel trapped between trying hard and being worn down at the same time. Some days it\u2019s just a constant battle to keep myself functioning at all.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly tough\u2014feeling stuck in that fog and overwhelmed by even the simplest decisions, all while wrestling with self-doubt. It\u2019s completely understandable to find that frustrating and draining. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen more about what those days are like for you or anything else you want to share about this experience.\nPatient: Those bad days feel like my mind is just wrapped in a thick fog. It\u2019s not just hard to think clearly\u2014it\u2019s like everything slows down or gets tangled, and making even the smallest decision becomes overwhelming. Choosing what to eat or what to focus on feels like a huge task. All that indecisiveness just builds this weight of self-doubt, making me question if I\u2019m capable of handling even the basics. The frustration piles up because I\u2019m putting in so much effort just to stay functioning, but it often feels like I\u2019m running on empty. It\u2019s exhausting to constantly fight through this fog and doubt, but somehow I keep trying to push forward, even when it\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\nDoctor: Thank you for trusting me with how hard this has been for you. It\u2019s clear how much strength it takes just to keep pushing through when your mind feels so foggy and overwhelmed, and that effort truly matters. It\u2019s okay to feel exhausted by all of this\u2014you\u2019re doing the best you can in a really tough situation. When you\u2019re ready, we can keep talking through everything together.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that\u2014it means a lot to hear that support. It\u2019s definitely still a struggle most days, trying to push through the mental fog and fatigue. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m making progress, and other times it just feels like the exhaustion is taking over again. But I\u2019m trying to stay consistent and keep moving forward, even if it\u2019s slow or difficult. Having someone to talk to about it helps, so thank you.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a lot of resilience in pushing forward even when things feel overwhelming, and it\u2019s good to hear that talking about it helps a bit. Sometimes, when people deal with this kind of exhaustion and fog, feelings of worthlessness or guilt can come up\u2014do you find yourself experiencing thoughts like that? If so, how do they affect you?\nPatient: Yes, I do experience feelings of worthlessness and guilt from time to time. They mostly come from doubting myself\u2014wondering if I\u2019m doing enough or if I\u2019m capable of keeping up with everything I need to handle. It\u2019s frustrating because these feelings weigh on me, but they\u2019re not constant or overwhelming. I think the fatigue and mental fog complicate how I feel emotionally, making everything feel more layered and difficult to sort through. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m aware of these feelings and try to keep them in perspective as best I can.\nDoctor: You have a lot of insight into how these feelings show up for you, and that self-awareness is really important\u2014even when it doesn\u2019t make things easy. It makes sense that fatigue and mental fog can make emotions feel more tangled and hard to sort out. What you\u2019re feeling is valid, and it\u2019s okay to have these struggles while still working through them. I\u2019m here to support you as you keep navigating all of this.\nPatient: Thank you, I really appreciate that. Having support like this makes a difference, even when things feel tough. I know the fatigue and mental fog aren\u2019t going away overnight, but I\u2019m determined to keep working through it and managing what I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m trying to stay focused on moving forward and not letting all of this hold me back completely. Having someone to talk to helps keep me grounded and motivated to keep going.\nDoctor: I\u2019m really glad to hear that having this space to talk helps you stay grounded and motivated. Sometimes during stressful times or emotional ups and downs, changes in appetite or weight can happen too\u2014have you noticed anything like that lately? Understanding these details can help us get a clearer picture of how you\u2019ve been feeling overall.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed some slight changes in my appetite\u2014not huge, but enough to feel different from usual. Sometimes I eat less when I\u2019m feeling more stressed or tired, and other times it\u2019s just hard to keep a steady routine with meals. My weight has fluctuated a bit, but nothing drastic. I think these changes are just part of how all the stress and fatigue are affecting me overall. It\u2019s noticeable, but not extreme.\nDoctor: It sounds like these shifts in appetite and routine are subtle but definitely present, and that can still have a real impact on how you feel day to day. Do you notice if eating less or having an irregular meal schedule affects your energy or mood in particular ways?

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough. Even though my motivation dips because of this, I still try to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught between wanting to keep going and feeling worn down at the same time.\nDoctor: It sounds really exhausting to be caught between wanting to keep going and feeling so worn down. Can you tell me more about the times when concentrating or making decisions feels especially hard? How do these moments affect your day-to-day life and how you see yourself?\nPatient: When the fatigue and restlessness are at their worst, concentrating or making even simple decisions feels almost impossible. It\u2019s like my mind gets foggy or stuck, and I can\u2019t just move forward with what needs doing. Those moments pile up and make everything feel overwhelming, which then feeds into this growing self-doubt\u2014like I\u2019m not capable of handling even basic tasks. It\u2019s frustrating to feel trapped between trying hard and being worn down at the same time. Some days it\u2019s just a constant battle to keep myself functioning at all.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly tough\u2014feeling stuck in that fog and overwhelmed by even the simplest decisions, all while wrestling with self-doubt. It\u2019s completely understandable to find that frustrating and draining. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen more about what those days are like for you or anything else you want to share about this experience.\nPatient: Those bad days feel like my mind is just wrapped in a thick fog. It\u2019s not just hard to think clearly\u2014it\u2019s like everything slows down or gets tangled, and making even the smallest decision becomes overwhelming. Choosing what to eat or what to focus on feels like a huge task. All that indecisiveness just builds this weight of self-doubt, making me question if I\u2019m capable of handling even the basics. The frustration piles up because I\u2019m putting in so much effort just to stay functioning, but it often feels like I\u2019m running on empty. It\u2019s exhausting to constantly fight through this fog and doubt, but somehow I keep trying to push forward, even when it\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\nDoctor: Thank you for trusting me with how hard this has been for you. It\u2019s clear how much strength it takes just to keep pushing through when your mind feels so foggy and overwhelmed, and that effort truly matters. It\u2019s okay to feel exhausted by all of this\u2014you\u2019re doing the best you can in a really tough situation. When you\u2019re ready, we can keep talking through everything together.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that\u2014it means a lot to hear that support. It\u2019s definitely still a struggle most days, trying to push through the mental fog and fatigue. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m making progress, and other times it just feels like the exhaustion is taking over again. But I\u2019m trying to stay consistent and keep moving forward, even if it\u2019s slow or difficult. Having someone to talk to about it helps, so thank you.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a lot of resilience in pushing forward even when things feel overwhelming, and it\u2019s good to hear that talking about it helps a bit. Sometimes, when people deal with this kind of exhaustion and fog, feelings of worthlessness or guilt can come up\u2014do you find yourself experiencing thoughts like that? If so, how do they affect you?\nPatient: Yes, I do experience feelings of worthlessness and guilt from time to time. They mostly come from doubting myself\u2014wondering if I\u2019m doing enough or if I\u2019m capable of keeping up with everything I need to handle. It\u2019s frustrating because these feelings weigh on me, but they\u2019re not constant or overwhelming. I think the fatigue and mental fog complicate how I feel emotionally, making everything feel more layered and difficult to sort through. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m aware of these feelings and try to keep them in perspective as best I can.\nDoctor: You have a lot of insight into how these feelings show up for you, and that self-awareness is really important\u2014even when it doesn\u2019t make things easy. It makes sense that fatigue and mental fog can make emotions feel more tangled and hard to sort out. What you\u2019re feeling is valid, and it\u2019s okay to have these struggles while still working through them. I\u2019m here to support you as you keep navigating all of this.\nPatient: Thank you, I really appreciate that. Having support like this makes a difference, even when things feel tough. I know the fatigue and mental fog aren\u2019t going away overnight, but I\u2019m determined to keep working through it and managing what I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m trying to stay focused on moving forward and not letting all of this hold me back completely. Having someone to talk to helps keep me grounded and motivated to keep going.\nDoctor: I\u2019m really glad to hear that having this space to talk helps you stay grounded and motivated. Sometimes during stressful times or emotional ups and downs, changes in appetite or weight can happen too\u2014have you noticed anything like that lately? Understanding these details can help us get a clearer picture of how you\u2019ve been feeling overall.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed some slight changes in my appetite\u2014not huge, but enough to feel different from usual. Sometimes I eat less when I\u2019m feeling more stressed or tired, and other times it\u2019s just hard to keep a steady routine with meals. My weight has fluctuated a bit, but nothing drastic. I think these changes are just part of how all the stress and fatigue are affecting me overall. It\u2019s noticeable, but not extreme.\nDoctor: It sounds like these shifts in appetite and routine are subtle but definitely present, and that can still have a real impact on how you feel day to day. Do you notice if eating less or having an irregular meal schedule affects your energy or mood in particular ways? If there\u2019s anything about your eating patterns or weight changes that\u2019s been worrying you, feel free to share\u2014it all helps paint the full picture.\nPatient: When my appetite gets off, like eating less or skipping meals, I do notice my fatigue and restlessness tend to get worse. It feels like not fueling properly makes everything feel heavier\u2014both physically and mentally. But I haven\u2019t seen any big changes in my weight, just some minor shifts. I think the appetite changes are mostly tied to the stress and tiredness I\u2019m dealing with, and they kind of feed into each other.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough. Even though my motivation dips because of this, I still try to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught between wanting to keep going and feeling worn down at the same time.\nDoctor: It sounds really exhausting to be caught between wanting to keep going and feeling so worn down. Can you tell me more about the times when concentrating or making decisions feels especially hard? How do these moments affect your day-to-day life and how you see yourself?\nPatient: When the fatigue and restlessness are at their worst, concentrating or making even simple decisions feels almost impossible. It\u2019s like my mind gets foggy or stuck, and I can\u2019t just move forward with what needs doing. Those moments pile up and make everything feel overwhelming, which then feeds into this growing self-doubt\u2014like I\u2019m not capable of handling even basic tasks. It\u2019s frustrating to feel trapped between trying hard and being worn down at the same time. Some days it\u2019s just a constant battle to keep myself functioning at all.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly tough\u2014feeling stuck in that fog and overwhelmed by even the simplest decisions, all while wrestling with self-doubt. It\u2019s completely understandable to find that frustrating and draining. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen more about what those days are like for you or anything else you want to share about this experience.\nPatient: Those bad days feel like my mind is just wrapped in a thick fog. It\u2019s not just hard to think clearly\u2014it\u2019s like everything slows down or gets tangled, and making even the smallest decision becomes overwhelming. Choosing what to eat or what to focus on feels like a huge task. All that indecisiveness just builds this weight of self-doubt, making me question if I\u2019m capable of handling even the basics. The frustration piles up because I\u2019m putting in so much effort just to stay functioning, but it often feels like I\u2019m running on empty. It\u2019s exhausting to constantly fight through this fog and doubt, but somehow I keep trying to push forward, even when it\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\nDoctor: Thank you for trusting me with how hard this has been for you. It\u2019s clear how much strength it takes just to keep pushing through when your mind feels so foggy and overwhelmed, and that effort truly matters. It\u2019s okay to feel exhausted by all of this\u2014you\u2019re doing the best you can in a really tough situation. When you\u2019re ready, we can keep talking through everything together.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that\u2014it means a lot to hear that support. It\u2019s definitely still a struggle most days, trying to push through the mental fog and fatigue. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m making progress, and other times it just feels like the exhaustion is taking over again. But I\u2019m trying to stay consistent and keep moving forward, even if it\u2019s slow or difficult. Having someone to talk to about it helps, so thank you.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a lot of resilience in pushing forward even when things feel overwhelming, and it\u2019s good to hear that talking about it helps a bit. Sometimes, when people deal with this kind of exhaustion and fog, feelings of worthlessness or guilt can come up\u2014do you find yourself experiencing thoughts like that? If so, how do they affect you?\nPatient: Yes, I do experience feelings of worthlessness and guilt from time to time. They mostly come from doubting myself\u2014wondering if I\u2019m doing enough or if I\u2019m capable of keeping up with everything I need to handle. It\u2019s frustrating because these feelings weigh on me, but they\u2019re not constant or overwhelming. I think the fatigue and mental fog complicate how I feel emotionally, making everything feel more layered and difficult to sort through. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m aware of these feelings and try to keep them in perspective as best I can.\nDoctor: You have a lot of insight into how these feelings show up for you, and that self-awareness is really important\u2014even when it doesn\u2019t make things easy. It makes sense that fatigue and mental fog can make emotions feel more tangled and hard to sort out. What you\u2019re feeling is valid, and it\u2019s okay to have these struggles while still working through them. I\u2019m here to support you as you keep navigating all of this.\nPatient: Thank you, I really appreciate that. Having support like this makes a difference, even when things feel tough. I know the fatigue and mental fog aren\u2019t going away overnight, but I\u2019m determined to keep working through it and managing what I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m trying to stay focused on moving forward and not letting all of this hold me back completely. Having someone to talk to helps keep me grounded and motivated to keep going.\nDoctor: I\u2019m really glad to hear that having this space to talk helps you stay grounded and motivated. Sometimes during stressful times or emotional ups and downs, changes in appetite or weight can happen too\u2014have you noticed anything like that lately? Understanding these details can help us get a clearer picture of how you\u2019ve been feeling overall.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed some slight changes in my appetite\u2014not huge, but enough to feel different from usual. Sometimes I eat less when I\u2019m feeling more stressed or tired, and other times it\u2019s just hard to keep a steady routine with meals. My weight has fluctuated a bit, but nothing drastic. I think these changes are just part of how all the stress and fatigue are affecting me overall. It\u2019s noticeable, but not extreme.\nDoctor: It sounds like these shifts in appetite and routine are subtle but definitely present, and that can still have a real impact on how you feel day to day. Do you notice if eating less or having an irregular meal schedule affects your energy or mood in particular ways? If there\u2019s anything about your eating patterns or weight changes that\u2019s been worrying you, feel free to share\u2014it all helps paint the full picture.\nPatient: When my appetite gets off, like eating less or skipping meals, I do notice my fatigue and restlessness tend to get worse. It feels like not fueling properly makes everything feel heavier\u2014both physically and mentally. But I haven\u2019t seen any big changes in my weight, just some minor shifts. I think the appetite changes are mostly tied to the stress and tiredness I\u2019m dealing with, and they kind of feed into each other. It\u2019s a cycle I\u2019m aware of, even if it\u2019s not extreme.\nDoctor: You\u2019re really attuned to how your appetite, fatigue, and stress all loop together\u2014and that kind of awareness is a tough but important step. It takes real effort to stay mindful of those connections and try to find ways to break the cycle.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough. Even though my motivation dips because of this, I still try to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught between wanting to keep going and feeling worn down at the same time.\nDoctor: It sounds really exhausting to be caught between wanting to keep going and feeling so worn down. Can you tell me more about the times when concentrating or making decisions feels especially hard? How do these moments affect your day-to-day life and how you see yourself?\nPatient: When the fatigue and restlessness are at their worst, concentrating or making even simple decisions feels almost impossible. It\u2019s like my mind gets foggy or stuck, and I can\u2019t just move forward with what needs doing. Those moments pile up and make everything feel overwhelming, which then feeds into this growing self-doubt\u2014like I\u2019m not capable of handling even basic tasks. It\u2019s frustrating to feel trapped between trying hard and being worn down at the same time. Some days it\u2019s just a constant battle to keep myself functioning at all.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly tough\u2014feeling stuck in that fog and overwhelmed by even the simplest decisions, all while wrestling with self-doubt. It\u2019s completely understandable to find that frustrating and draining. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen more about what those days are like for you or anything else you want to share about this experience.\nPatient: Those bad days feel like my mind is just wrapped in a thick fog. It\u2019s not just hard to think clearly\u2014it\u2019s like everything slows down or gets tangled, and making even the smallest decision becomes overwhelming. Choosing what to eat or what to focus on feels like a huge task. All that indecisiveness just builds this weight of self-doubt, making me question if I\u2019m capable of handling even the basics. The frustration piles up because I\u2019m putting in so much effort just to stay functioning, but it often feels like I\u2019m running on empty. It\u2019s exhausting to constantly fight through this fog and doubt, but somehow I keep trying to push forward, even when it\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\nDoctor: Thank you for trusting me with how hard this has been for you. It\u2019s clear how much strength it takes just to keep pushing through when your mind feels so foggy and overwhelmed, and that effort truly matters. It\u2019s okay to feel exhausted by all of this\u2014you\u2019re doing the best you can in a really tough situation. When you\u2019re ready, we can keep talking through everything together.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that\u2014it means a lot to hear that support. It\u2019s definitely still a struggle most days, trying to push through the mental fog and fatigue. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m making progress, and other times it just feels like the exhaustion is taking over again. But I\u2019m trying to stay consistent and keep moving forward, even if it\u2019s slow or difficult. Having someone to talk to about it helps, so thank you.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a lot of resilience in pushing forward even when things feel overwhelming, and it\u2019s good to hear that talking about it helps a bit. Sometimes, when people deal with this kind of exhaustion and fog, feelings of worthlessness or guilt can come up\u2014do you find yourself experiencing thoughts like that? If so, how do they affect you?\nPatient: Yes, I do experience feelings of worthlessness and guilt from time to time. They mostly come from doubting myself\u2014wondering if I\u2019m doing enough or if I\u2019m capable of keeping up with everything I need to handle. It\u2019s frustrating because these feelings weigh on me, but they\u2019re not constant or overwhelming. I think the fatigue and mental fog complicate how I feel emotionally, making everything feel more layered and difficult to sort through. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m aware of these feelings and try to keep them in perspective as best I can.\nDoctor: You have a lot of insight into how these feelings show up for you, and that self-awareness is really important\u2014even when it doesn\u2019t make things easy. It makes sense that fatigue and mental fog can make emotions feel more tangled and hard to sort out. What you\u2019re feeling is valid, and it\u2019s okay to have these struggles while still working through them. I\u2019m here to support you as you keep navigating all of this.\nPatient: Thank you, I really appreciate that. Having support like this makes a difference, even when things feel tough. I know the fatigue and mental fog aren\u2019t going away overnight, but I\u2019m determined to keep working through it and managing what I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m trying to stay focused on moving forward and not letting all of this hold me back completely. Having someone to talk to helps keep me grounded and motivated to keep going.\nDoctor: I\u2019m really glad to hear that having this space to talk helps you stay grounded and motivated. Sometimes during stressful times or emotional ups and downs, changes in appetite or weight can happen too\u2014have you noticed anything like that lately? Understanding these details can help us get a clearer picture of how you\u2019ve been feeling overall.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed some slight changes in my appetite\u2014not huge, but enough to feel different from usual. Sometimes I eat less when I\u2019m feeling more stressed or tired, and other times it\u2019s just hard to keep a steady routine with meals. My weight has fluctuated a bit, but nothing drastic. I think these changes are just part of how all the stress and fatigue are affecting me overall. It\u2019s noticeable, but not extreme.\nDoctor: It sounds like these shifts in appetite and routine are subtle but definitely present, and that can still have a real impact on how you feel day to day. Do you notice if eating less or having an irregular meal schedule affects your energy or mood in particular ways? If there\u2019s anything about your eating patterns or weight changes that\u2019s been worrying you, feel free to share\u2014it all helps paint the full picture.\nPatient: When my appetite gets off, like eating less or skipping meals, I do notice my fatigue and restlessness tend to get worse. It feels like not fueling properly makes everything feel heavier\u2014both physically and mentally. But I haven\u2019t seen any big changes in my weight, just some minor shifts. I think the appetite changes are mostly tied to the stress and tiredness I\u2019m dealing with, and they kind of feed into each other. It\u2019s a cycle I\u2019m aware of, even if it\u2019s not extreme.\nDoctor: You\u2019re really attuned to how your appetite, fatigue, and stress all loop together\u2014and that kind of awareness is a tough but important step. It takes real effort to stay mindful of those connections and try to find ways to break the cycle. Have you discovered any small strategies or supports that help you manage your appetite or handle the stress when things start to feel overwhelming?\nPatient: I\u2019ve tried taking small breaks or changing my environment when I start feeling overwhelmed, and sometimes that helps a bit with the stress and appetite. It\u2019s not a perfect fix by any means, but those little shifts can make things a little easier to handle in the moment.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough. Even though my motivation dips because of this, I still try to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught between wanting to keep going and feeling worn down at the same time.\nDoctor: It sounds really exhausting to be caught between wanting to keep going and feeling so worn down. Can you tell me more about the times when concentrating or making decisions feels especially hard? How do these moments affect your day-to-day life and how you see yourself?\nPatient: When the fatigue and restlessness are at their worst, concentrating or making even simple decisions feels almost impossible. It\u2019s like my mind gets foggy or stuck, and I can\u2019t just move forward with what needs doing. Those moments pile up and make everything feel overwhelming, which then feeds into this growing self-doubt\u2014like I\u2019m not capable of handling even basic tasks. It\u2019s frustrating to feel trapped between trying hard and being worn down at the same time. Some days it\u2019s just a constant battle to keep myself functioning at all.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly tough\u2014feeling stuck in that fog and overwhelmed by even the simplest decisions, all while wrestling with self-doubt. It\u2019s completely understandable to find that frustrating and draining. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen more about what those days are like for you or anything else you want to share about this experience.\nPatient: Those bad days feel like my mind is just wrapped in a thick fog. It\u2019s not just hard to think clearly\u2014it\u2019s like everything slows down or gets tangled, and making even the smallest decision becomes overwhelming. Choosing what to eat or what to focus on feels like a huge task. All that indecisiveness just builds this weight of self-doubt, making me question if I\u2019m capable of handling even the basics. The frustration piles up because I\u2019m putting in so much effort just to stay functioning, but it often feels like I\u2019m running on empty. It\u2019s exhausting to constantly fight through this fog and doubt, but somehow I keep trying to push forward, even when it\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\nDoctor: Thank you for trusting me with how hard this has been for you. It\u2019s clear how much strength it takes just to keep pushing through when your mind feels so foggy and overwhelmed, and that effort truly matters. It\u2019s okay to feel exhausted by all of this\u2014you\u2019re doing the best you can in a really tough situation. When you\u2019re ready, we can keep talking through everything together.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that\u2014it means a lot to hear that support. It\u2019s definitely still a struggle most days, trying to push through the mental fog and fatigue. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m making progress, and other times it just feels like the exhaustion is taking over again. But I\u2019m trying to stay consistent and keep moving forward, even if it\u2019s slow or difficult. Having someone to talk to about it helps, so thank you.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a lot of resilience in pushing forward even when things feel overwhelming, and it\u2019s good to hear that talking about it helps a bit. Sometimes, when people deal with this kind of exhaustion and fog, feelings of worthlessness or guilt can come up\u2014do you find yourself experiencing thoughts like that? If so, how do they affect you?\nPatient: Yes, I do experience feelings of worthlessness and guilt from time to time. They mostly come from doubting myself\u2014wondering if I\u2019m doing enough or if I\u2019m capable of keeping up with everything I need to handle. It\u2019s frustrating because these feelings weigh on me, but they\u2019re not constant or overwhelming. I think the fatigue and mental fog complicate how I feel emotionally, making everything feel more layered and difficult to sort through. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m aware of these feelings and try to keep them in perspective as best I can.\nDoctor: You have a lot of insight into how these feelings show up for you, and that self-awareness is really important\u2014even when it doesn\u2019t make things easy. It makes sense that fatigue and mental fog can make emotions feel more tangled and hard to sort out. What you\u2019re feeling is valid, and it\u2019s okay to have these struggles while still working through them. I\u2019m here to support you as you keep navigating all of this.\nPatient: Thank you, I really appreciate that. Having support like this makes a difference, even when things feel tough. I know the fatigue and mental fog aren\u2019t going away overnight, but I\u2019m determined to keep working through it and managing what I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m trying to stay focused on moving forward and not letting all of this hold me back completely. Having someone to talk to helps keep me grounded and motivated to keep going.\nDoctor: I\u2019m really glad to hear that having this space to talk helps you stay grounded and motivated. Sometimes during stressful times or emotional ups and downs, changes in appetite or weight can happen too\u2014have you noticed anything like that lately? Understanding these details can help us get a clearer picture of how you\u2019ve been feeling overall.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed some slight changes in my appetite\u2014not huge, but enough to feel different from usual. Sometimes I eat less when I\u2019m feeling more stressed or tired, and other times it\u2019s just hard to keep a steady routine with meals. My weight has fluctuated a bit, but nothing drastic. I think these changes are just part of how all the stress and fatigue are affecting me overall. It\u2019s noticeable, but not extreme.\nDoctor: It sounds like these shifts in appetite and routine are subtle but definitely present, and that can still have a real impact on how you feel day to day. Do you notice if eating less or having an irregular meal schedule affects your energy or mood in particular ways? If there\u2019s anything about your eating patterns or weight changes that\u2019s been worrying you, feel free to share\u2014it all helps paint the full picture.\nPatient: When my appetite gets off, like eating less or skipping meals, I do notice my fatigue and restlessness tend to get worse. It feels like not fueling properly makes everything feel heavier\u2014both physically and mentally. But I haven\u2019t seen any big changes in my weight, just some minor shifts. I think the appetite changes are mostly tied to the stress and tiredness I\u2019m dealing with, and they kind of feed into each other. It\u2019s a cycle I\u2019m aware of, even if it\u2019s not extreme.\nDoctor: You\u2019re really attuned to how your appetite, fatigue, and stress all loop together\u2014and that kind of awareness is a tough but important step. It takes real effort to stay mindful of those connections and try to find ways to break the cycle. Have you discovered any small strategies or supports that help you manage your appetite or handle the stress when things start to feel overwhelming?\nPatient: I\u2019ve tried taking small breaks or changing my environment when I start feeling overwhelmed, and sometimes that helps a bit with the stress and appetite. It\u2019s not a perfect fix by any means, but those little shifts can make things a little easier to handle in the moment. Still, managing the whole cycle of stress, fatigue, and appetite is difficult, and I haven\u2019t found a full solution yet. But I keep trying to work through it, even when it gets frustrating.\nDoctor: Those small steps you\u2019re taking to care for yourself, like breaks and changing scenery, show a lot of strength and self-awareness, even if they don\u2019t solve everything right away. I want to gently check in about something important\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide?

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough. Even though my motivation dips because of this, I still try to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught between wanting to keep going and feeling worn down at the same time.\nDoctor: It sounds really exhausting to be caught between wanting to keep going and feeling so worn down. Can you tell me more about the times when concentrating or making decisions feels especially hard? How do these moments affect your day-to-day life and how you see yourself?\nPatient: When the fatigue and restlessness are at their worst, concentrating or making even simple decisions feels almost impossible. It\u2019s like my mind gets foggy or stuck, and I can\u2019t just move forward with what needs doing. Those moments pile up and make everything feel overwhelming, which then feeds into this growing self-doubt\u2014like I\u2019m not capable of handling even basic tasks. It\u2019s frustrating to feel trapped between trying hard and being worn down at the same time. Some days it\u2019s just a constant battle to keep myself functioning at all.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly tough\u2014feeling stuck in that fog and overwhelmed by even the simplest decisions, all while wrestling with self-doubt. It\u2019s completely understandable to find that frustrating and draining. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen more about what those days are like for you or anything else you want to share about this experience.\nPatient: Those bad days feel like my mind is just wrapped in a thick fog. It\u2019s not just hard to think clearly\u2014it\u2019s like everything slows down or gets tangled, and making even the smallest decision becomes overwhelming. Choosing what to eat or what to focus on feels like a huge task. All that indecisiveness just builds this weight of self-doubt, making me question if I\u2019m capable of handling even the basics. The frustration piles up because I\u2019m putting in so much effort just to stay functioning, but it often feels like I\u2019m running on empty. It\u2019s exhausting to constantly fight through this fog and doubt, but somehow I keep trying to push forward, even when it\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\nDoctor: Thank you for trusting me with how hard this has been for you. It\u2019s clear how much strength it takes just to keep pushing through when your mind feels so foggy and overwhelmed, and that effort truly matters. It\u2019s okay to feel exhausted by all of this\u2014you\u2019re doing the best you can in a really tough situation. When you\u2019re ready, we can keep talking through everything together.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that\u2014it means a lot to hear that support. It\u2019s definitely still a struggle most days, trying to push through the mental fog and fatigue. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m making progress, and other times it just feels like the exhaustion is taking over again. But I\u2019m trying to stay consistent and keep moving forward, even if it\u2019s slow or difficult. Having someone to talk to about it helps, so thank you.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a lot of resilience in pushing forward even when things feel overwhelming, and it\u2019s good to hear that talking about it helps a bit. Sometimes, when people deal with this kind of exhaustion and fog, feelings of worthlessness or guilt can come up\u2014do you find yourself experiencing thoughts like that? If so, how do they affect you?\nPatient: Yes, I do experience feelings of worthlessness and guilt from time to time. They mostly come from doubting myself\u2014wondering if I\u2019m doing enough or if I\u2019m capable of keeping up with everything I need to handle. It\u2019s frustrating because these feelings weigh on me, but they\u2019re not constant or overwhelming. I think the fatigue and mental fog complicate how I feel emotionally, making everything feel more layered and difficult to sort through. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m aware of these feelings and try to keep them in perspective as best I can.\nDoctor: You have a lot of insight into how these feelings show up for you, and that self-awareness is really important\u2014even when it doesn\u2019t make things easy. It makes sense that fatigue and mental fog can make emotions feel more tangled and hard to sort out. What you\u2019re feeling is valid, and it\u2019s okay to have these struggles while still working through them. I\u2019m here to support you as you keep navigating all of this.\nPatient: Thank you, I really appreciate that. Having support like this makes a difference, even when things feel tough. I know the fatigue and mental fog aren\u2019t going away overnight, but I\u2019m determined to keep working through it and managing what I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m trying to stay focused on moving forward and not letting all of this hold me back completely. Having someone to talk to helps keep me grounded and motivated to keep going.\nDoctor: I\u2019m really glad to hear that having this space to talk helps you stay grounded and motivated. Sometimes during stressful times or emotional ups and downs, changes in appetite or weight can happen too\u2014have you noticed anything like that lately? Understanding these details can help us get a clearer picture of how you\u2019ve been feeling overall.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed some slight changes in my appetite\u2014not huge, but enough to feel different from usual. Sometimes I eat less when I\u2019m feeling more stressed or tired, and other times it\u2019s just hard to keep a steady routine with meals. My weight has fluctuated a bit, but nothing drastic. I think these changes are just part of how all the stress and fatigue are affecting me overall. It\u2019s noticeable, but not extreme.\nDoctor: It sounds like these shifts in appetite and routine are subtle but definitely present, and that can still have a real impact on how you feel day to day. Do you notice if eating less or having an irregular meal schedule affects your energy or mood in particular ways? If there\u2019s anything about your eating patterns or weight changes that\u2019s been worrying you, feel free to share\u2014it all helps paint the full picture.\nPatient: When my appetite gets off, like eating less or skipping meals, I do notice my fatigue and restlessness tend to get worse. It feels like not fueling properly makes everything feel heavier\u2014both physically and mentally. But I haven\u2019t seen any big changes in my weight, just some minor shifts. I think the appetite changes are mostly tied to the stress and tiredness I\u2019m dealing with, and they kind of feed into each other. It\u2019s a cycle I\u2019m aware of, even if it\u2019s not extreme.\nDoctor: You\u2019re really attuned to how your appetite, fatigue, and stress all loop together\u2014and that kind of awareness is a tough but important step. It takes real effort to stay mindful of those connections and try to find ways to break the cycle. Have you discovered any small strategies or supports that help you manage your appetite or handle the stress when things start to feel overwhelming?\nPatient: I\u2019ve tried taking small breaks or changing my environment when I start feeling overwhelmed, and sometimes that helps a bit with the stress and appetite. It\u2019s not a perfect fix by any means, but those little shifts can make things a little easier to handle in the moment. Still, managing the whole cycle of stress, fatigue, and appetite is difficult, and I haven\u2019t found a full solution yet. But I keep trying to work through it, even when it gets frustrating.\nDoctor: Those small steps you\u2019re taking to care for yourself, like breaks and changing scenery, show a lot of strength and self-awareness, even if they don\u2019t solve everything right away. I want to gently check in about something important\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide?

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough. Even though my motivation dips because of this, I still try to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught between wanting to keep going and feeling worn down at the same time.\nDoctor: It sounds really exhausting to be caught between wanting to keep going and feeling so worn down. Can you tell me more about the times when concentrating or making decisions feels especially hard? How do these moments affect your day-to-day life and how you see yourself?\nPatient: When the fatigue and restlessness are at their worst, concentrating or making even simple decisions feels almost impossible. It\u2019s like my mind gets foggy or stuck, and I can\u2019t just move forward with what needs doing. Those moments pile up and make everything feel overwhelming, which then feeds into this growing self-doubt\u2014like I\u2019m not capable of handling even basic tasks. It\u2019s frustrating to feel trapped between trying hard and being worn down at the same time. Some days it\u2019s just a constant battle to keep myself functioning at all.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly tough\u2014feeling stuck in that fog and overwhelmed by even the simplest decisions, all while wrestling with self-doubt. It\u2019s completely understandable to find that frustrating and draining. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen more about what those days are like for you or anything else you want to share about this experience.\nPatient: Those bad days feel like my mind is just wrapped in a thick fog. It\u2019s not just hard to think clearly\u2014it\u2019s like everything slows down or gets tangled, and making even the smallest decision becomes overwhelming. Choosing what to eat or what to focus on feels like a huge task. All that indecisiveness just builds this weight of self-doubt, making me question if I\u2019m capable of handling even the basics. The frustration piles up because I\u2019m putting in so much effort just to stay functioning, but it often feels like I\u2019m running on empty. It\u2019s exhausting to constantly fight through this fog and doubt, but somehow I keep trying to push forward, even when it\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\nDoctor: Thank you for trusting me with how hard this has been for you. It\u2019s clear how much strength it takes just to keep pushing through when your mind feels so foggy and overwhelmed, and that effort truly matters. It\u2019s okay to feel exhausted by all of this\u2014you\u2019re doing the best you can in a really tough situation. When you\u2019re ready, we can keep talking through everything together.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that\u2014it means a lot to hear that support. It\u2019s definitely still a struggle most days, trying to push through the mental fog and fatigue. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m making progress, and other times it just feels like the exhaustion is taking over again. But I\u2019m trying to stay consistent and keep moving forward, even if it\u2019s slow or difficult. Having someone to talk to about it helps, so thank you.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a lot of resilience in pushing forward even when things feel overwhelming, and it\u2019s good to hear that talking about it helps a bit. Sometimes, when people deal with this kind of exhaustion and fog, feelings of worthlessness or guilt can come up\u2014do you find yourself experiencing thoughts like that? If so, how do they affect you?\nPatient: Yes, I do experience feelings of worthlessness and guilt from time to time. They mostly come from doubting myself\u2014wondering if I\u2019m doing enough or if I\u2019m capable of keeping up with everything I need to handle. It\u2019s frustrating because these feelings weigh on me, but they\u2019re not constant or overwhelming. I think the fatigue and mental fog complicate how I feel emotionally, making everything feel more layered and difficult to sort through. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m aware of these feelings and try to keep them in perspective as best I can.\nDoctor: You have a lot of insight into how these feelings show up for you, and that self-awareness is really important\u2014even when it doesn\u2019t make things easy. It makes sense that fatigue and mental fog can make emotions feel more tangled and hard to sort out. What you\u2019re feeling is valid, and it\u2019s okay to have these struggles while still working through them. I\u2019m here to support you as you keep navigating all of this.\nPatient: Thank you, I really appreciate that. Having support like this makes a difference, even when things feel tough. I know the fatigue and mental fog aren\u2019t going away overnight, but I\u2019m determined to keep working through it and managing what I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m trying to stay focused on moving forward and not letting all of this hold me back completely. Having someone to talk to helps keep me grounded and motivated to keep going.\nDoctor: I\u2019m really glad to hear that having this space to talk helps you stay grounded and motivated. Sometimes during stressful times or emotional ups and downs, changes in appetite or weight can happen too\u2014have you noticed anything like that lately? Understanding these details can help us get a clearer picture of how you\u2019ve been feeling overall.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed some slight changes in my appetite\u2014not huge, but enough to feel different from usual. Sometimes I eat less when I\u2019m feeling more stressed or tired, and other times it\u2019s just hard to keep a steady routine with meals. My weight has fluctuated a bit, but nothing drastic. I think these changes are just part of how all the stress and fatigue are affecting me overall. It\u2019s noticeable, but not extreme.\nDoctor: It sounds like these shifts in appetite and routine are subtle but definitely present, and that can still have a real impact on how you feel day to day. Do you notice if eating less or having an irregular meal schedule affects your energy or mood in particular ways? If there\u2019s anything about your eating patterns or weight changes that\u2019s been worrying you, feel free to share\u2014it all helps paint the full picture.\nPatient: When my appetite gets off, like eating less or skipping meals, I do notice my fatigue and restlessness tend to get worse. It feels like not fueling properly makes everything feel heavier\u2014both physically and mentally. But I haven\u2019t seen any big changes in my weight, just some minor shifts. I think the appetite changes are mostly tied to the stress and tiredness I\u2019m dealing with, and they kind of feed into each other. It\u2019s a cycle I\u2019m aware of, even if it\u2019s not extreme.\nDoctor: You\u2019re really attuned to how your appetite, fatigue, and stress all loop together\u2014and that kind of awareness is a tough but important step. It takes real effort to stay mindful of those connections and try to find ways to break the cycle. Have you discovered any small strategies or supports that help you manage your appetite or handle the stress when things start to feel overwhelming?\nPatient: I\u2019ve tried taking small breaks or changing my environment when I start feeling overwhelmed, and sometimes that helps a bit with the stress and appetite. It\u2019s not a perfect fix by any means, but those little shifts can make things a little easier to handle in the moment. Still, managing the whole cycle of stress, fatigue, and appetite is difficult, and I haven\u2019t found a full solution yet. But I keep trying to work through it, even when it gets frustrating.\nDoctor: Those small steps you\u2019re taking to care for yourself, like breaks and changing scenery, show a lot of strength and self-awareness, even if they don\u2019t solve everything right away. I want to gently check in about something important\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide? It\u2019s a hard topic, but I ask because your safety and support are really important to me.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide. Even though I\u2019m still struggling with the fatigue and restlessness, I\u2019m committed to managing these symptoms and doing what I can to keep moving forward. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m focused on finding ways to cope and maintain some balance.\nDoctor: I really admire your commitment to managing everything you\u2019re facing, even when it\u2019s difficult. Your determination to keep moving forward and find balance is meaningful, and it\u2019s important to remember you\u2019re not alone in this. Whenever you want to share more\u2014or if things ever feel heavier\u2014you can always reach out, and I\u2019m here to support you throughout your journey.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nI really admire your commitment to managing everything you\u2019re facing, even when it\u2019s difficult.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough. Even though my motivation dips because of this, I still try to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught between wanting to keep going and feeling worn down at the same time.\nDoctor: It sounds really exhausting to be caught between wanting to keep going and feeling so worn down. Can you tell me more about the times when concentrating or making decisions feels especially hard? How do these moments affect your day-to-day life and how you see yourself?\nPatient: When the fatigue and restlessness are at their worst, concentrating or making even simple decisions feels almost impossible. It\u2019s like my mind gets foggy or stuck, and I can\u2019t just move forward with what needs doing. Those moments pile up and make everything feel overwhelming, which then feeds into this growing self-doubt\u2014like I\u2019m not capable of handling even basic tasks. It\u2019s frustrating to feel trapped between trying hard and being worn down at the same time. Some days it\u2019s just a constant battle to keep myself functioning at all.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly tough\u2014feeling stuck in that fog and overwhelmed by even the simplest decisions, all while wrestling with self-doubt. It\u2019s completely understandable to find that frustrating and draining. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen more about what those days are like for you or anything else you want to share about this experience.\nPatient: Those bad days feel like my mind is just wrapped in a thick fog. It\u2019s not just hard to think clearly\u2014it\u2019s like everything slows down or gets tangled, and making even the smallest decision becomes overwhelming. Choosing what to eat or what to focus on feels like a huge task. All that indecisiveness just builds this weight of self-doubt, making me question if I\u2019m capable of handling even the basics. The frustration piles up because I\u2019m putting in so much effort just to stay functioning, but it often feels like I\u2019m running on empty. It\u2019s exhausting to constantly fight through this fog and doubt, but somehow I keep trying to push forward, even when it\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\nDoctor: Thank you for trusting me with how hard this has been for you. It\u2019s clear how much strength it takes just to keep pushing through when your mind feels so foggy and overwhelmed, and that effort truly matters. It\u2019s okay to feel exhausted by all of this\u2014you\u2019re doing the best you can in a really tough situation. When you\u2019re ready, we can keep talking through everything together.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that\u2014it means a lot to hear that support. It\u2019s definitely still a struggle most days, trying to push through the mental fog and fatigue. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m making progress, and other times it just feels like the exhaustion is taking over again. But I\u2019m trying to stay consistent and keep moving forward, even if it\u2019s slow or difficult. Having someone to talk to about it helps, so thank you.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a lot of resilience in pushing forward even when things feel overwhelming, and it\u2019s good to hear that talking about it helps a bit. Sometimes, when people deal with this kind of exhaustion and fog, feelings of worthlessness or guilt can come up\u2014do you find yourself experiencing thoughts like that? If so, how do they affect you?\nPatient: Yes, I do experience feelings of worthlessness and guilt from time to time. They mostly come from doubting myself\u2014wondering if I\u2019m doing enough or if I\u2019m capable of keeping up with everything I need to handle. It\u2019s frustrating because these feelings weigh on me, but they\u2019re not constant or overwhelming. I think the fatigue and mental fog complicate how I feel emotionally, making everything feel more layered and difficult to sort through. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m aware of these feelings and try to keep them in perspective as best I can.\nDoctor: You have a lot of insight into how these feelings show up for you, and that self-awareness is really important\u2014even when it doesn\u2019t make things easy. It makes sense that fatigue and mental fog can make emotions feel more tangled and hard to sort out. What you\u2019re feeling is valid, and it\u2019s okay to have these struggles while still working through them. I\u2019m here to support you as you keep navigating all of this.\nPatient: Thank you, I really appreciate that. Having support like this makes a difference, even when things feel tough. I know the fatigue and mental fog aren\u2019t going away overnight, but I\u2019m determined to keep working through it and managing what I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m trying to stay focused on moving forward and not letting all of this hold me back completely. Having someone to talk to helps keep me grounded and motivated to keep going.\nDoctor: I\u2019m really glad to hear that having this space to talk helps you stay grounded and motivated. Sometimes during stressful times or emotional ups and downs, changes in appetite or weight can happen too\u2014have you noticed anything like that lately? Understanding these details can help us get a clearer picture of how you\u2019ve been feeling overall.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed some slight changes in my appetite\u2014not huge, but enough to feel different from usual. Sometimes I eat less when I\u2019m feeling more stressed or tired, and other times it\u2019s just hard to keep a steady routine with meals. My weight has fluctuated a bit, but nothing drastic. I think these changes are just part of how all the stress and fatigue are affecting me overall. It\u2019s noticeable, but not extreme.\nDoctor: It sounds like these shifts in appetite and routine are subtle but definitely present, and that can still have a real impact on how you feel day to day. Do you notice if eating less or having an irregular meal schedule affects your energy or mood in particular ways? If there\u2019s anything about your eating patterns or weight changes that\u2019s been worrying you, feel free to share\u2014it all helps paint the full picture.\nPatient: When my appetite gets off, like eating less or skipping meals, I do notice my fatigue and restlessness tend to get worse. It feels like not fueling properly makes everything feel heavier\u2014both physically and mentally. But I haven\u2019t seen any big changes in my weight, just some minor shifts. I think the appetite changes are mostly tied to the stress and tiredness I\u2019m dealing with, and they kind of feed into each other. It\u2019s a cycle I\u2019m aware of, even if it\u2019s not extreme.\nDoctor: You\u2019re really attuned to how your appetite, fatigue, and stress all loop together\u2014and that kind of awareness is a tough but important step. It takes real effort to stay mindful of those connections and try to find ways to break the cycle. Have you discovered any small strategies or supports that help you manage your appetite or handle the stress when things start to feel overwhelming?\nPatient: I\u2019ve tried taking small breaks or changing my environment when I start feeling overwhelmed, and sometimes that helps a bit with the stress and appetite. It\u2019s not a perfect fix by any means, but those little shifts can make things a little easier to handle in the moment. Still, managing the whole cycle of stress, fatigue, and appetite is difficult, and I haven\u2019t found a full solution yet. But I keep trying to work through it, even when it gets frustrating.\nDoctor: Those small steps you\u2019re taking to care for yourself, like breaks and changing scenery, show a lot of strength and self-awareness, even if they don\u2019t solve everything right away. I want to gently check in about something important\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide? It\u2019s a hard topic, but I ask because your safety and support are really important to me.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide. Even though I\u2019m still struggling with the fatigue and restlessness, I\u2019m committed to managing these symptoms and doing what I can to keep moving forward. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m focused on finding ways to cope and maintain some balance.\nDoctor: I really admire your commitment to managing everything you\u2019re facing, even when it\u2019s difficult. Your determination to keep moving forward and find balance is meaningful, and it\u2019s important to remember you\u2019re not alone in this. Whenever you want to share more\u2014or if things ever feel heavier\u2014you can always reach out, and I\u2019m here to support you throughout your journey.\nPatient: Thank you, I really appreciate your support.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough. Even though my motivation dips because of this, I still try to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught between wanting to keep going and feeling worn down at the same time.\nDoctor: It sounds really exhausting to be caught between wanting to keep going and feeling so worn down. Can you tell me more about the times when concentrating or making decisions feels especially hard? How do these moments affect your day-to-day life and how you see yourself?\nPatient: When the fatigue and restlessness are at their worst, concentrating or making even simple decisions feels almost impossible. It\u2019s like my mind gets foggy or stuck, and I can\u2019t just move forward with what needs doing. Those moments pile up and make everything feel overwhelming, which then feeds into this growing self-doubt\u2014like I\u2019m not capable of handling even basic tasks. It\u2019s frustrating to feel trapped between trying hard and being worn down at the same time. Some days it\u2019s just a constant battle to keep myself functioning at all.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly tough\u2014feeling stuck in that fog and overwhelmed by even the simplest decisions, all while wrestling with self-doubt. It\u2019s completely understandable to find that frustrating and draining. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen more about what those days are like for you or anything else you want to share about this experience.\nPatient: Those bad days feel like my mind is just wrapped in a thick fog. It\u2019s not just hard to think clearly\u2014it\u2019s like everything slows down or gets tangled, and making even the smallest decision becomes overwhelming. Choosing what to eat or what to focus on feels like a huge task. All that indecisiveness just builds this weight of self-doubt, making me question if I\u2019m capable of handling even the basics. The frustration piles up because I\u2019m putting in so much effort just to stay functioning, but it often feels like I\u2019m running on empty. It\u2019s exhausting to constantly fight through this fog and doubt, but somehow I keep trying to push forward, even when it\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\nDoctor: Thank you for trusting me with how hard this has been for you. It\u2019s clear how much strength it takes just to keep pushing through when your mind feels so foggy and overwhelmed, and that effort truly matters. It\u2019s okay to feel exhausted by all of this\u2014you\u2019re doing the best you can in a really tough situation. When you\u2019re ready, we can keep talking through everything together.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that\u2014it means a lot to hear that support. It\u2019s definitely still a struggle most days, trying to push through the mental fog and fatigue. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m making progress, and other times it just feels like the exhaustion is taking over again. But I\u2019m trying to stay consistent and keep moving forward, even if it\u2019s slow or difficult. Having someone to talk to about it helps, so thank you.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a lot of resilience in pushing forward even when things feel overwhelming, and it\u2019s good to hear that talking about it helps a bit. Sometimes, when people deal with this kind of exhaustion and fog, feelings of worthlessness or guilt can come up\u2014do you find yourself experiencing thoughts like that? If so, how do they affect you?\nPatient: Yes, I do experience feelings of worthlessness and guilt from time to time. They mostly come from doubting myself\u2014wondering if I\u2019m doing enough or if I\u2019m capable of keeping up with everything I need to handle. It\u2019s frustrating because these feelings weigh on me, but they\u2019re not constant or overwhelming. I think the fatigue and mental fog complicate how I feel emotionally, making everything feel more layered and difficult to sort through. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m aware of these feelings and try to keep them in perspective as best I can.\nDoctor: You have a lot of insight into how these feelings show up for you, and that self-awareness is really important\u2014even when it doesn\u2019t make things easy. It makes sense that fatigue and mental fog can make emotions feel more tangled and hard to sort out. What you\u2019re feeling is valid, and it\u2019s okay to have these struggles while still working through them. I\u2019m here to support you as you keep navigating all of this.\nPatient: Thank you, I really appreciate that. Having support like this makes a difference, even when things feel tough. I know the fatigue and mental fog aren\u2019t going away overnight, but I\u2019m determined to keep working through it and managing what I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m trying to stay focused on moving forward and not letting all of this hold me back completely. Having someone to talk to helps keep me grounded and motivated to keep going.\nDoctor: I\u2019m really glad to hear that having this space to talk helps you stay grounded and motivated. Sometimes during stressful times or emotional ups and downs, changes in appetite or weight can happen too\u2014have you noticed anything like that lately? Understanding these details can help us get a clearer picture of how you\u2019ve been feeling overall.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed some slight changes in my appetite\u2014not huge, but enough to feel different from usual. Sometimes I eat less when I\u2019m feeling more stressed or tired, and other times it\u2019s just hard to keep a steady routine with meals. My weight has fluctuated a bit, but nothing drastic. I think these changes are just part of how all the stress and fatigue are affecting me overall. It\u2019s noticeable, but not extreme.\nDoctor: It sounds like these shifts in appetite and routine are subtle but definitely present, and that can still have a real impact on how you feel day to day. Do you notice if eating less or having an irregular meal schedule affects your energy or mood in particular ways? If there\u2019s anything about your eating patterns or weight changes that\u2019s been worrying you, feel free to share\u2014it all helps paint the full picture.\nPatient: When my appetite gets off, like eating less or skipping meals, I do notice my fatigue and restlessness tend to get worse. It feels like not fueling properly makes everything feel heavier\u2014both physically and mentally. But I haven\u2019t seen any big changes in my weight, just some minor shifts. I think the appetite changes are mostly tied to the stress and tiredness I\u2019m dealing with, and they kind of feed into each other. It\u2019s a cycle I\u2019m aware of, even if it\u2019s not extreme.\nDoctor: You\u2019re really attuned to how your appetite, fatigue, and stress all loop together\u2014and that kind of awareness is a tough but important step. It takes real effort to stay mindful of those connections and try to find ways to break the cycle. Have you discovered any small strategies or supports that help you manage your appetite or handle the stress when things start to feel overwhelming?\nPatient: I\u2019ve tried taking small breaks or changing my environment when I start feeling overwhelmed, and sometimes that helps a bit with the stress and appetite. It\u2019s not a perfect fix by any means, but those little shifts can make things a little easier to handle in the moment. Still, managing the whole cycle of stress, fatigue, and appetite is difficult, and I haven\u2019t found a full solution yet. But I keep trying to work through it, even when it gets frustrating.\nDoctor: Those small steps you\u2019re taking to care for yourself, like breaks and changing scenery, show a lot of strength and self-awareness, even if they don\u2019t solve everything right away. I want to gently check in about something important\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide? It\u2019s a hard topic, but I ask because your safety and support are really important to me.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide. Even though I\u2019m still struggling with the fatigue and restlessness, I\u2019m committed to managing these symptoms and doing what I can to keep moving forward. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m focused on finding ways to cope and maintain some balance.\nDoctor: I really admire your commitment to managing everything you\u2019re facing, even when it\u2019s difficult. Your determination to keep moving forward and find balance is meaningful, and it\u2019s important to remember you\u2019re not alone in this. Whenever you want to share more\u2014or if things ever feel heavier\u2014you can always reach out, and I\u2019m here to support you throughout your journey.\nPatient: Thank you, I really appreciate your support. It helps to know I\u2019m not alone in this. Even though it\u2019s hard, I\u2019m committed to doing what I can to manage my symptoms and keep some sort of balance. The struggle is still there, but I\u2019m focused on coping and moving forward, one step at a time.\nDoctor: I\u2019m really glad to hear that feeling supported makes a difference. To help me understand better, can you share more about your experience with feeling down or sad\u2014how often do those feelings come up, and how strong are they when they do?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nI\u2019m really glad to hear that feeling supported makes a difference.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: Hi. Thanks for saying that\u2014it helps. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days, even when I get some rest. At the same time, I often feel restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle down physically, which makes it hard to relax. I also notice it\u2019s tougher than usual to focus on things, especially when I\u2019m trying to study or work. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be productive, but my mind kind of drifts or gets stuck. Overall, I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed experience\u2014physically worn out but also kind of on edge.\nDoctor: That sounds really challenging\u2014to feel worn out physically but also keyed up in a way that makes it hard to settle. Can you tell me a bit more about when these tired and restless feelings first started? How do they get in the way of your day-to-day tasks, like studying or working at the caf\u00e9?\nPatient: It\u2019s been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, like being overworked or stressed, but it\u2019s stuck around longer than I expected. The tiredness and restlessness together really make concentrating a struggle\u2014trying to focus on reading or writing feels draining, like I\u2019m using up energy just to stay present. When I\u2019m at the caf\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to slow down or feel settled between tasks, which makes the day more exhausting than it should be. I try to push through, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, both my body and mind are worn out, and that\u2019s frustrating because I want to function better than this.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to be stuck in that cycle of feeling worn out but also unable to relax. Along with the tiredness and restlessness, have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation\u2014like feeling down or less interested in things you usually care about? How is this fatigue affecting the way you get through your days overall?\nPatient: I\u2019ve definitely felt down sometimes\u2014not like a deep sadness, but enough to notice it\u2019s there. It\u2019s frustrating because I still care about the things I normally do; I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in them. But the fatigue makes everything slower and more tiring. Even simple tasks that used to feel routine take more effort and leave me drained. My motivation dips here and there, especially when I\u2019m wiped out, but it\u2019s not completely gone. I still push myself, even if it\u2019s harder than before. It\u2019s like I want to keep going, but my energy just isn\u2019t cooperating, and that\u2019s tough to deal with day to day.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to understand how you\u2019re feeling. When you say you feel down sometimes, can you tell me how often those moments come up and how intense that feeling usually is? Do you notice if your mood shifts a lot during the day or week, or if anything else about your emotions changes?\nPatient: The feeling of being down comes up fairly often, but it\u2019s usually mild to moderate\u2014not overwhelming or constant. I notice it can shift during the day or over the course of the week\u2014some days are better than others. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling more down, I also get a bit more irritable or restless, but it doesn\u2019t last too long. Overall, the changes in mood are noticeable but not too extreme. It feels like a background noise more than a loud presence, if that makes sense.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense\u2014the mood shifts feeling like background noise rather than something overwhelming can still be draining in its own way. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel frustrated by that, especially when those ups and downs come with restlessness or irritability. When you notice your mood changing like that, is there anything you find helps or anything you notice about what\u2019s going on around you or inside you at those times?\nPatient: Yeah, when my mood shifts, I often feel more agitated or irritable, and the restlessness gets harder to shake. I notice my thoughts can race or I get distracted more easily, which makes focusing really tough. Sometimes I try doing something simple\u2014like changing my environment or taking a short break\u2014and that can help a little, but it\u2019s not always enough. It feels like these moments come in waves that I just have to ride through, which can get tiring after a while.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a really clear way to describe it\u2014those waves of restlessness and racing thoughts sound exhausting. I\u2019d like to understand more about how this restlessness shows up physically for you. Do you find yourself moving around more than usual, tapping your fingers, pacing, or feeling like you just can\u2019t sit still? Or do you notice times when your movements slow down or feel heavier instead?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. I often find myself pacing back and forth because I just can\u2019t sit still\u2014tapping my fingers or shifting in my seat a lot. It feels like this restless energy that I need to get out somehow. But at the same time, there are moments when my movements feel heavy or slowed down, like my body doesn\u2019t want to move as quickly as my mind does. It\u2019s confusing because I feel restless inside but physically slowed or weighed down. These shifts make daily tasks more complicated than they should be. Sometimes, trying to get through simple things feels twice as exhausting because of this push and pull between restlessness and heaviness. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s like my body and mind are working against each other, and that just adds to the fatigue I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That push and pull between feeling restless inside but slowed down on the outside sounds really challenging to manage. How do these shifts in your energy and movement affect your day-to-day routines or the way you cope with everything you\u2019re juggling? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about any other ways these feelings impact you.\nPatient: These fluctuations make it really hard to stick to a daily routine. Some days, I have the energy to push through, even though I feel restless and uncomfortable, but that effort just wears me down faster. Other times, when I feel slowed down and heavy, even simple tasks feel overwhelming and take way more time than they should. The disconnect between my restless mind and my tired body is frustrating\u2014it feels like my brain wants to go, but my body holds me back. This tension makes it harder to focus or be productive, especially with school and work. I keep trying to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting, and sometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up without burning out.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that feeling pulled in different directions like that would make sticking to a routine tough and energy feel so limited. Sleep often plays a big role in how our energy holds up\u2014have you noticed any changes with your sleep lately, like trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up still feeling tired?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had major trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I often wake up feeling kind of tired or not fully rested. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting enough hours, but the quality doesn\u2019t always feel great. I know sleep might not be the main cause of the fatigue I\u2019m dealing with, but I thought it was worth mentioning since it probably plays some role.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know how you\u2019re sleeping. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you wake up tired? Do you notice if this happens most mornings, or just some days? Are there any specific things during the night, like restlessness or dreams, that you\u2019ve noticed might affect how rested you feel?\nPatient: I wake up tired most mornings, not just sometimes. I don\u2019t really have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but the sleep quality feels off a lot of the time. Sometimes I notice I\u2019m restless during the night\u2014like I move around or wake up briefly\u2014and I think that might be part of why I don\u2019t feel fully rested when I get up. It\u2019s not constant, but it happens enough to make a difference. Overall, it feels like I get enough sleep time, but the rest isn\u2019t quite refreshing.\nDoctor: That sounds really frustrating\u2014getting the hours but still waking up feeling worn out can take a real toll. When you notice those restless moments during the night, do they tend to happen at certain times or after specific things during the day? How do you find that this disrupted rest affects you when you\u2019re up and about during the day?\nPatient: The restless moments during the night don\u2019t really happen at specific times or after particular things during the day\u2014they just seem to come on unpredictably. When my rest gets disrupted like that, it definitely makes the fatigue worse during the day, and I find it even harder to concentrate or stay focused. The combination of physical tiredness and mental restlessness makes daily tasks feel even more challenging, and it\u2019s frustrating because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against my own body and mind all the time.\nDoctor: It\u2019s really understandable that all of this\u2014feeling restless at night and drained during the day\u2014would make things feel like a constant struggle. I\u2019m wondering, have you noticed any changes in how much interest or enjoyment you get from activities you used to like?\nPatient: I still find enjoyment in the things I used to like, but the fatigue and restlessness definitely make it harder to actually take part in them. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to be involved and get the same satisfaction I used to, but it feels like I\u2019m always having to push myself just to get through the activity. The interest is still there, but the effort needed sometimes makes it tough to fully engage or get the same energy out of it.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014to still want to enjoy your usual activities but feel like your energy and restlessness are holding you back. Are there any particular things you\u2019ve found especially hard to engage with lately? How does this struggle to participate affect how you feel emotionally or your motivation to keep trying?\nPatient: The hardest things for me right now are definitely mentally demanding tasks, like studying or concentrating at work. When my fatigue and restlessness make it tough to focus, it just feeds into this cycle of frustration and self-doubt\u2014I start wondering if I\u2019m falling behind or not doing enough. Even though my motivation dips because of this, I still try to push through, but it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like I\u2019m caught between wanting to keep going and feeling worn down at the same time.\nDoctor: It sounds really exhausting to be caught between wanting to keep going and feeling so worn down. Can you tell me more about the times when concentrating or making decisions feels especially hard? How do these moments affect your day-to-day life and how you see yourself?\nPatient: When the fatigue and restlessness are at their worst, concentrating or making even simple decisions feels almost impossible. It\u2019s like my mind gets foggy or stuck, and I can\u2019t just move forward with what needs doing. Those moments pile up and make everything feel overwhelming, which then feeds into this growing self-doubt\u2014like I\u2019m not capable of handling even basic tasks. It\u2019s frustrating to feel trapped between trying hard and being worn down at the same time. Some days it\u2019s just a constant battle to keep myself functioning at all.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly tough\u2014feeling stuck in that fog and overwhelmed by even the simplest decisions, all while wrestling with self-doubt. It\u2019s completely understandable to find that frustrating and draining. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen more about what those days are like for you or anything else you want to share about this experience.\nPatient: Those bad days feel like my mind is just wrapped in a thick fog. It\u2019s not just hard to think clearly\u2014it\u2019s like everything slows down or gets tangled, and making even the smallest decision becomes overwhelming. Choosing what to eat or what to focus on feels like a huge task. All that indecisiveness just builds this weight of self-doubt, making me question if I\u2019m capable of handling even the basics. The frustration piles up because I\u2019m putting in so much effort just to stay functioning, but it often feels like I\u2019m running on empty. It\u2019s exhausting to constantly fight through this fog and doubt, but somehow I keep trying to push forward, even when it\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\nDoctor: Thank you for trusting me with how hard this has been for you. It\u2019s clear how much strength it takes just to keep pushing through when your mind feels so foggy and overwhelmed, and that effort truly matters. It\u2019s okay to feel exhausted by all of this\u2014you\u2019re doing the best you can in a really tough situation. When you\u2019re ready, we can keep talking through everything together.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that\u2014it means a lot to hear that support. It\u2019s definitely still a struggle most days, trying to push through the mental fog and fatigue. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m making progress, and other times it just feels like the exhaustion is taking over again. But I\u2019m trying to stay consistent and keep moving forward, even if it\u2019s slow or difficult. Having someone to talk to about it helps, so thank you.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve shown a lot of resilience in pushing forward even when things feel overwhelming, and it\u2019s good to hear that talking about it helps a bit. Sometimes, when people deal with this kind of exhaustion and fog, feelings of worthlessness or guilt can come up\u2014do you find yourself experiencing thoughts like that? If so, how do they affect you?\nPatient: Yes, I do experience feelings of worthlessness and guilt from time to time. They mostly come from doubting myself\u2014wondering if I\u2019m doing enough or if I\u2019m capable of keeping up with everything I need to handle. It\u2019s frustrating because these feelings weigh on me, but they\u2019re not constant or overwhelming. I think the fatigue and mental fog complicate how I feel emotionally, making everything feel more layered and difficult to sort through. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m aware of these feelings and try to keep them in perspective as best I can.\nDoctor: You have a lot of insight into how these feelings show up for you, and that self-awareness is really important\u2014even when it doesn\u2019t make things easy. It makes sense that fatigue and mental fog can make emotions feel more tangled and hard to sort out. What you\u2019re feeling is valid, and it\u2019s okay to have these struggles while still working through them. I\u2019m here to support you as you keep navigating all of this.\nPatient: Thank you, I really appreciate that. Having support like this makes a difference, even when things feel tough. I know the fatigue and mental fog aren\u2019t going away overnight, but I\u2019m determined to keep working through it and managing what I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m trying to stay focused on moving forward and not letting all of this hold me back completely. Having someone to talk to helps keep me grounded and motivated to keep going.\nDoctor: I\u2019m really glad to hear that having this space to talk helps you stay grounded and motivated. Sometimes during stressful times or emotional ups and downs, changes in appetite or weight can happen too\u2014have you noticed anything like that lately? Understanding these details can help us get a clearer picture of how you\u2019ve been feeling overall.\nPatient: I\u2019ve noticed some slight changes in my appetite\u2014not huge, but enough to feel different from usual. Sometimes I eat less when I\u2019m feeling more stressed or tired, and other times it\u2019s just hard to keep a steady routine with meals. My weight has fluctuated a bit, but nothing drastic. I think these changes are just part of how all the stress and fatigue are affecting me overall. It\u2019s noticeable, but not extreme.\nDoctor: It sounds like these shifts in appetite and routine are subtle but definitely present, and that can still have a real impact on how you feel day to day. Do you notice if eating less or having an irregular meal schedule affects your energy or mood in particular ways? If there\u2019s anything about your eating patterns or weight changes that\u2019s been worrying you, feel free to share\u2014it all helps paint the full picture.\nPatient: When my appetite gets off, like eating less or skipping meals, I do notice my fatigue and restlessness tend to get worse. It feels like not fueling properly makes everything feel heavier\u2014both physically and mentally. But I haven\u2019t seen any big changes in my weight, just some minor shifts. I think the appetite changes are mostly tied to the stress and tiredness I\u2019m dealing with, and they kind of feed into each other. It\u2019s a cycle I\u2019m aware of, even if it\u2019s not extreme.\nDoctor: You\u2019re really attuned to how your appetite, fatigue, and stress all loop together\u2014and that kind of awareness is a tough but important step. It takes real effort to stay mindful of those connections and try to find ways to break the cycle. Have you discovered any small strategies or supports that help you manage your appetite or handle the stress when things start to feel overwhelming?\nPatient: I\u2019ve tried taking small breaks or changing my environment when I start feeling overwhelmed, and sometimes that helps a bit with the stress and appetite. It\u2019s not a perfect fix by any means, but those little shifts can make things a little easier to handle in the moment. Still, managing the whole cycle of stress, fatigue, and appetite is difficult, and I haven\u2019t found a full solution yet. But I keep trying to work through it, even when it gets frustrating.\nDoctor: Those small steps you\u2019re taking to care for yourself, like breaks and changing scenery, show a lot of strength and self-awareness, even if they don\u2019t solve everything right away. I want to gently check in about something important\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide? It\u2019s a hard topic, but I ask because your safety and support are really important to me.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide. Even though I\u2019m still struggling with the fatigue and restlessness, I\u2019m committed to managing these symptoms and doing what I can to keep moving forward. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m focused on finding ways to cope and maintain some balance.\nDoctor: I really admire your commitment to managing everything you\u2019re facing, even when it\u2019s difficult. Your determination to keep moving forward and find balance is meaningful, and it\u2019s important to remember you\u2019re not alone in this. Whenever you want to share more\u2014or if things ever feel heavier\u2014you can always reach out, and I\u2019m here to support you throughout your journey.\nPatient: Thank you, I really appreciate your support. It helps to know I\u2019m not alone in this. Even though it\u2019s hard, I\u2019m committed to doing what I can to manage my symptoms and keep some sort of balance. The struggle is still there, but I\u2019m focused on coping and moving forward, one step at a time.\nDoctor: I\u2019m really glad to hear that feeling supported makes a difference. To help me understand better, can you share more about your experience with feeling down or sad\u2014how often do those feelings come up, and how strong are they when they do?\nPatient: I feel down fairly often, but the intensity is usually mild to moderate. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s constant or overwhelming, but it\u2019s definitely noticeable. My mood can shift throughout the day or over the week, with some moments feeling a bit heavier than others. Overall, it feels like a pattern I\u2019m aware of and trying to manage, rather than something that completely takes over.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
