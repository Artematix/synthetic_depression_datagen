Do not default to late 20s/early 30s. Create facets appropriate to the patient's life stage.\n- Make sure all information you create is compatible with the depression symptom profile. Higher symptom severity should show up as more impact on daily life, relationships, or goals. Lower severity should feel milder.\n- Keep trauma and serious adversity realistic and not universal. Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

Like, are you sleeping less or more than usual, and how has that been affecting your energy or mood during the day? Same for eating\u2014has your appetite changed much?\nPatient: Sleep has been a bit inconsistent\u2014sometimes I get fewer hours, other times it\u2019s restless. Appetite\u2019s dropped a little, which has caused some weight loss. Energy is definitely lower than before, but I can still get through the day without too much trouble.\nDoctor: That low energy\u2014how much is it getting in the way of your day-to-day stuff?

And when things are tougher, does that shift how motivated or in what mood you find yourself?\nPatient: Daily chores and school work have been more tiring lately. Motivation dips now and then, but not drastically. Overall, my mood has stayed pretty steady despite feeling more worn out.\nDoctor: You mentioned your mood's been steady, which is good to hear. Have you noticed any times lately when you\u2019ve felt more sadness or emptiness than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, there have been some moments where I felt down or empty, but they don\u2019t last long.

What do you usually do to manage them?\nPatient: They happen now and then, but not too often. When they do, they\u2019re noticeable but not overwhelming. I usually focus on sticking to my daily routine or keep busy with tasks to get through them.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. It\u2019s important to check\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide, even just briefly? It\u2019s okay to be honest here; understanding this helps me support you better.\nPatient: There have been brief thoughts about death from time to time, but they\u2019re not frequent and I don\u2019t act on them.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open. Can you tell me how often these thoughts come up, and if there\u2019s anything that tends to bring them on? Also, have you ever had any plans or intentions related to those thoughts? This is a safe space to talk about anything you\u2019re feeling.\nPatient: They come up now and then, but not very often. Usually when I\u2019m feeling particularly worn out or low on energy.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

Taking things one day at a time mostly.\nDoctor: When you say sleep and appetite have been \"a little off,\" can you tell me a bit more about that? Like, are you sleeping less or more than usual, and how has that been affecting your energy or mood during the day? Same for eating\u2014has your appetite changed much?\nPatient: Sleep has been a bit inconsistent\u2014sometimes I get fewer hours, other times it\u2019s restless. Appetite\u2019s dropped a little, which has caused some weight loss. Energy is definitely lower than before, but I can still get through the day without too much trouble.\nDoctor: That low energy\u2014how much is it getting in the way of your day-to-day stuff? Are there things that feel harder to finish or start because of it?\nPatient: It definitely makes some tasks take more effort or longer than usual. Still, I\u2019m able to complete what I need to do, even if it\u2019s more tiring than before.\nDoctor: Which tasks feel like they take more effort right now? And when things are tougher, does that shift how motivated or in what mood you find yourself?\nPatient: Daily chores and school work have been more tiring lately. Motivation dips now and then, but not drastically. Overall, my mood has stayed pretty steady despite feeling more worn out.\nDoctor: You mentioned your mood's been steady, which is good to hear. Have you noticed any times lately when you\u2019ve felt more sadness or emptiness than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, there have been some moments where I felt down or empty, but they don\u2019t last long. Mostly, my mood stays steady through the day.\nDoctor: When those down or empty moments come up, how often do they happen? And when they do, how strong or overwhelming do they feel? What do you usually do to manage them?\nPatient: They happen now and then, but not too often. When they do, they\u2019re noticeable but not overwhelming. I usually focus on sticking to my daily routine or keep busy with tasks to get through them.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. It\u2019s important to check\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide, even just briefly? It\u2019s okay to be honest here; understanding this helps me support you better.\nPatient: There have been brief thoughts about death from time to time, but they\u2019re not frequent and I don\u2019t act on them.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open. Can you tell me how often these thoughts come up, and if there\u2019s anything that tends to bring them on? Also, have you ever had any plans or intentions related to those thoughts? This is a safe space to talk about anything you\u2019re feeling.\nPatient: They come up now and then, but not very often. Usually when I\u2019m feeling particularly worn out or low on energy. I haven\u2019t had any plans or intentions connected to those thoughts.\nDoctor: It\u2019s pretty common for feelings of worthlessness or guilt to come up when someone\u2019s struggling. Have you noticed anything like that for yourself lately? Maybe times when you felt especially down on yourself or burdened by guilt?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve had some feelings like that occasionally. They\u2019re not overwhelming but tend to come up more when I\u2019m feeling tired or worn down.\nDoctor: Can you think of a recent time when you felt that way\u2014down on yourself or guilty? How often do these feelings come up, especially when you're feeling tired? It's helpful to understand how these moments fit into your day-to-day.\nPatient: A few days ago, I felt a bit guilty for not finishing some chores because I was really tired. It happens occasionally, mostly when my energy is low, but not all the time.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any loss of interest or pleasure in activities you usually enjoy?

Same for eating\u2014has your appetite changed much?\nPatient: Sleep has been a bit inconsistent\u2014sometimes I get fewer hours, other times it\u2019s restless.

Motivation dips now and then, but not drastically. Overall, my mood has stayed pretty steady despite feeling more worn out.\nDoctor: You mentioned your mood's been steady, which is good to hear.

Things that used to feel rewarding or fun\u2014do they feel different these days?\nPatient: Not really. Things I usually enjoy still feel the same.\nDoctor: How about concentration or decision-making\u2014have you noticed any trouble focusing on tasks or making choices lately?

Mostly, my mood stays steady through the day.\nDoctor: When those down or empty moments come up, how often do they happen? And when they do, how strong or overwhelming do they feel? What do you usually do to manage them?\nPatient: They happen now and then, but not too often. When they do, they\u2019re noticeable but not overwhelming. I usually focus on sticking to my daily routine or keep busy with tasks to get through them.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. It\u2019s important to check\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide, even just briefly? It\u2019s okay to be honest here; understanding this helps me support you better.\nPatient: There have been brief thoughts about death from time to time, but they\u2019re not frequent and I don\u2019t act on them.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open.

I haven\u2019t had any plans or intentions connected to those thoughts.\nDoctor: It\u2019s pretty common for feelings of worthlessness or guilt to come up when someone\u2019s struggling. Have you noticed anything like that for yourself lately? Maybe times when you felt especially down on yourself or burdened by guilt?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve had some feelings like that occasionally.

And when your sleep is off, how does that affect your day-to-day?\nPatient: It happens a few nights each week. The next day feels more tiring than usual, but I\u2019m still able to handle things.\nDoctor: When you\u2019re feeling that tired after a restless night, have you noticed if your body feels restless or, on the flip side, like your movements slow down?

How do these days usually feel physically?\nPatient: On tired days, I do notice my movements are a bit slower than usual.

Taking things one day at a time mostly.\nDoctor: When you say sleep and appetite have been \"a little off,\" can you tell me a bit more about that? Like, are you sleeping less or more than usual, and how has that been affecting your energy or mood during the day? Same for eating\u2014has your appetite changed much?\nPatient: Sleep has been a bit inconsistent\u2014sometimes I get fewer hours, other times it\u2019s restless. Appetite\u2019s dropped a little, which has caused some weight loss. Energy is definitely lower than before, but I can still get through the day without too much trouble.\nDoctor: That low energy\u2014how much is it getting in the way of your day-to-day stuff? Are there things that feel harder to finish or start because of it?\nPatient: It definitely makes some tasks take more effort or longer than usual.

What do you usually do to manage them?\nPatient: They happen now and then, but not too often. When they do, they\u2019re noticeable but not overwhelming. I usually focus on sticking to my daily routine or keep busy with tasks to get through them.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. It\u2019s important to check\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide, even just briefly? It\u2019s okay to be honest here; understanding this helps me support you better.\nPatient: There have been brief thoughts about death from time to time, but they\u2019re not frequent and I don\u2019t act on them.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open.

This is a safe space to talk about anything you\u2019re feeling.\nPatient: They come up now and then, but not very often. Usually when I\u2019m feeling particularly worn out or low on energy. I haven\u2019t had any plans or intentions connected to those thoughts.\nDoctor: It\u2019s pretty common for feelings of worthlessness or guilt to come up when someone\u2019s struggling. Have you noticed anything like that for yourself lately? Maybe times when you felt especially down on yourself or burdened by guilt?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve had some feelings like that occasionally.

Taking things one day at a time mostly.\nDoctor: When you say sleep and appetite have been \"a little off,\" can you tell me a bit more about that? Like, are you sleeping less or more than usual, and how has that been affecting your energy or mood during the day? Same for eating\u2014has your appetite changed much?\nPatient: Sleep has been a bit inconsistent\u2014sometimes I get fewer hours, other times it\u2019s restless. Appetite\u2019s dropped a little, which has caused some weight loss. Energy is definitely lower than before, but I can still get through the day without too much trouble.\nDoctor: That low energy\u2014how much is it getting in the way of your day-to-day stuff? Are there things that feel harder to finish or start because of it?\nPatient: It definitely makes some tasks take more effort or longer than usual. Still, I\u2019m able to complete what I need to do, even if it\u2019s more tiring than before.\nDoctor: Which tasks feel like they take more effort right now? And when things are tougher, does that shift how motivated or in what mood you find yourself?\nPatient: Daily chores and school work have been more tiring lately. Motivation dips now and then, but not drastically. Overall, my mood has stayed pretty steady despite feeling more worn out.\nDoctor: You mentioned your mood's been steady, which is good to hear. Have you noticed any times lately when you\u2019ve felt more sadness or emptiness than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, there have been some moments where I felt down or empty, but they don\u2019t last long. Mostly, my mood stays steady through the day.\nDoctor: When those down or empty moments come up, how often do they happen? And when they do, how strong or overwhelming do they feel? What do you usually do to manage them?\nPatient: They happen now and then, but not too often. When they do, they\u2019re noticeable but not overwhelming. I usually focus on sticking to my daily routine or keep busy with tasks to get through them.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. It\u2019s important to check\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide, even just briefly? It\u2019s okay to be honest here; understanding this helps me support you better.\nPatient: There have been brief thoughts about death from time to time, but they\u2019re not frequent and I don\u2019t act on them.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open. Can you tell me how often these thoughts come up, and if there\u2019s anything that tends to bring them on? Also, have you ever had any plans or intentions related to those thoughts? This is a safe space to talk about anything you\u2019re feeling.\nPatient: They come up now and then, but not very often. Usually when I\u2019m feeling particularly worn out or low on energy. I haven\u2019t had any plans or intentions connected to those thoughts.\nDoctor: It\u2019s pretty common for feelings of worthlessness or guilt to come up when someone\u2019s struggling. Have you noticed anything like that for yourself lately? Maybe times when you felt especially down on yourself or burdened by guilt?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve had some feelings like that occasionally. They\u2019re not overwhelming but tend to come up more when I\u2019m feeling tired or worn down.\nDoctor: Can you think of a recent time when you felt that way\u2014down on yourself or guilty? How often do these feelings come up, especially when you're feeling tired? It's helpful to understand how these moments fit into your day-to-day.\nPatient: A few days ago, I felt a bit guilty for not finishing some chores because I was really tired. It happens occasionally, mostly when my energy is low, but not all the time.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any loss of interest or pleasure in activities you usually enjoy? Things that used to feel rewarding or fun\u2014do they feel different these days?\nPatient: Not really. Things I usually enjoy still feel the same.\nDoctor: How about concentration or decision-making\u2014have you noticed any trouble focusing on tasks or making choices lately? Anything feel foggier or harder to think through than usual?\nPatient: Only rarely.

The next day feels more tiring than usual, but I\u2019m still able to handle things.\nDoctor: When you\u2019re feeling that tired after a restless night, have you noticed if your body feels restless or, on the flip side, like your movements slow down? How do these days usually feel physically?\nPatient: On tired days, I do notice my movements are a bit slower than usual. It\u2019s manageable though and doesn\u2019t really stop me from getting through the day.\nDoctor: You mentioned your appetite dropped a bit and you lost some weight\u2014has that change been steady, or does your appetite bounce around? And has the weight change felt significant to you?\nPatient: My appetite has generally been lower, but it does vary sometimes. The weight loss is noticeable, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s severe.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve been handling a fair bit\u2014juggling school, family, and these ups and downs can wear on anyone. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re finding ways to keep going, even when things feel tiring or off. These shifts in mood, energy, and appetite are common, and the fact that you\u2019re aware and managing day to day speaks to your resilience.\nPatient: Thanks. It\u2019s tiring at times, but I\u2019m still managing to keep up with what I need to do.\nDoctor: I really appreciate your honesty and the effort you\u2019re putting in, especially with everything on your plate\u2014school, family, and how you\u2019re feeling inside. Feeling tired makes total sense given all that, and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge that. Your resilience in keeping up is important, and we can continue working together to support that.\nPatient: I appreciate that. I\u2019m doing my best to keep up, even if it\u2019s tiring sometimes.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
