Do not default to late 20s/early 30s. Create facets appropriate to the patient's life stage.\n- Make sure all information you create is compatible with the depression symptom profile. Higher symptom severity should show up as more impact on daily life, relationships, or goals. Lower severity should feel milder.\n- Keep trauma and serious adversity realistic and not universal.

How does that fading enjoyment show up in your daily routine? Does it change how you feel about getting up or going about your day?\nPatient: It lessens the appeal of daily tasks, though I still manage to keep a rhythm. The motivation doesn\u2019t vanish entirely, but it\u2019s a quieter, more subdued drive these days.\nDoctor: Keeping a routine, even when motivation feels subdued, takes effort\u2014I respect that. How has your sleep been lately? Any trouble falling asleep, waking during the night, or feeling rested in the morning?\nPatient: Sleep is generally steady, with only the occasional mild disruption. It\u2019s not a significant concern.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that your sleep is mostly steady.

Do you notice if the low-energy spells come at certain times of day or after specific activities? Or do they seem to come without much warning?\nPatient: They come somewhat at random, without clear cause or pattern. Yet, I continue to meet daily demands, adapting as needed.\nDoctor: I admire how you adapt to those unpredictable dips and still keep things going. When these spur-of-the-moment low-energy spells hit, how do they affect your mood or ability to get through the day?\nPatient: They cast a brief shadow over mood, though the effect passes without upending the day.

Do you notice if the low-energy spells come at certain times of day or after specific activities? Or do they seem to come without much warning?\nPatient: They come somewhat at random, without clear cause or pattern. Yet, I continue to meet daily demands, adapting as needed.\nDoctor: I admire how you adapt to those unpredictable dips and still keep things going. When these spur-of-the-moment low-energy spells hit, how do they affect your mood or ability to get through the day?\nPatient: They cast a brief shadow over mood, though the effect passes without upending the day.

It\u2019s an interesting phenomenon\u2014how meaning shifts and sometimes dims, though the urge to seek understanding remains.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a powerful way to put it\u2014the world losing its colors. How does that fading enjoyment show up in your daily routine? Does it change how you feel about getting up or going about your day?\nPatient: It lessens the appeal of daily tasks, though I still manage to keep a rhythm. The motivation doesn\u2019t vanish entirely, but it\u2019s a quieter, more subdued drive these days.\nDoctor: Keeping a routine, even when motivation feels subdued, takes effort\u2014I respect that.

Do you notice if the low-energy spells come at certain times of day or after specific activities? Or do they seem to come without much warning?\nPatient: They come somewhat at random, without clear cause or pattern. Yet, I continue to meet daily demands, adapting as needed.\nDoctor: I admire how you adapt to those unpredictable dips and still keep things going. When these spur-of-the-moment low-energy spells hit, how do they affect your mood or ability to get through the day?\nPatient: They cast a brief shadow over mood, though the effect passes without upending the day. I remain focused on carrying through, despite the occasional dimming.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. I want to check in about something important\u2014have you found yourself having any thoughts about death or suicide lately? This is a safe space, and anything you share helps me support you better.\nPatient: Occasionally, thoughts of death emerge\u2014not as cries for action, but as contemplations on the inevitable. They orbit quietly, without overwhelming presence.\nDoctor: I understand those thoughts can feel more like quiet reflections than urgent feelings. Can you tell me how often they come up, how intense they feel, and if you\u2019ve had any urges or thoughts about acting on them? It\u2019s important we keep you safe and supported.\nPatient: They occur sporadically, with little intensity. No impulses or urges accompany these reflections. I regard them as part of an ongoing meditation, not immediate concern.\nDoctor: That thoughtful perspective helps me understand better.

Can be a comment or observation, not only a question.\n\nDSM:\n- Preferred when DSM symptom keys remain and the current topic is reasonably understood.\n- Suggest a natural transition from the current conversation.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

This is your space to share whatever feels right, at a pace that works for you. Whenever you're ready, can we talk about how your mood has been lately?\nPatient: My mood dips now and then\u2014nothing I can't manage. I find myself turning inward, considering what these feelings might mean. Reflection helps, even if it doesn\u2019t change much.\nDoctor: That thoughtful reflection is important. Along with those mood shifts, have you noticed if activities you usually enjoy still bring you pleasure, or has that changed at all?\nPatient: The enjoyment seems to fade, like a landscape losing its colors over time. It\u2019s an interesting phenomenon\u2014how meaning shifts and sometimes dims, though the urge to seek understanding remains.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a powerful way to put it\u2014the world losing its colors. How does that fading enjoyment show up in your daily routine? Does it change how you feel about getting up or going about your day?\nPatient: It lessens the appeal of daily tasks, though I still manage to keep a rhythm. The motivation doesn\u2019t vanish entirely, but it\u2019s a quieter, more subdued drive these days.\nDoctor: Keeping a routine, even when motivation feels subdued, takes effort\u2014I respect that. How has your sleep been lately? Any trouble falling asleep, waking during the night, or feeling rested in the morning?\nPatient: Sleep is generally steady, with only the occasional mild disruption. It\u2019s not a significant concern.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that your sleep is mostly steady. How about your energy during the day\u2014do you find yourself feeling more tired or low on energy than usual, even with those nights of decent rest?\nPatient: There are moments when energy wanes, though overall it hovers within acceptable bounds\u2014nothing too disruptive to note.\nDoctor: Those moments sound subtle but real. Do you notice if the low-energy spells come at certain times of day or after specific activities? Or do they seem to come without much warning?\nPatient: They come somewhat at random, without clear cause or pattern. Yet, I continue to meet daily demands, adapting as needed.\nDoctor: I admire how you adapt to those unpredictable dips and still keep things going. When these spur-of-the-moment low-energy spells hit, how do they affect your mood or ability to get through the day?\nPatient: They cast a brief shadow over mood, though the effect passes without upending the day. I remain focused on carrying through, despite the occasional dimming.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. I want to check in about something important\u2014have you found yourself having any thoughts about death or suicide lately? This is a safe space, and anything you share helps me support you better.\nPatient: Occasionally, thoughts of death emerge\u2014not as cries for action, but as contemplations on the inevitable. They orbit quietly, without overwhelming presence.\nDoctor: I understand those thoughts can feel more like quiet reflections than urgent feelings. Can you tell me how often they come up, how intense they feel, and if you\u2019ve had any urges or thoughts about acting on them? It\u2019s important we keep you safe and supported.\nPatient: They occur sporadically, with little intensity. No impulses or urges accompany these reflections. I regard them as part of an ongoing meditation, not immediate concern.\nDoctor: That thoughtful perspective helps me understand better. Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt creeping in recently?\nPatient: At times, a sense of worthlessness or guilt surfaces\u2014fleeting, not engulfing. They prompt quiet reflection rather than turmoil.\nDoctor: Those moments sound like they visit quietly but leave an impression. How often do these feelings arise, and have you noticed if anything in particular tends to bring them on?

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

This is your space to share whatever feels right, at a pace that works for you. Whenever you're ready, can we talk about how your mood has been lately?\nPatient: My mood dips now and then\u2014nothing I can't manage. I find myself turning inward, considering what these feelings might mean. Reflection helps, even if it doesn\u2019t change much.\nDoctor: That thoughtful reflection is important. Along with those mood shifts, have you noticed if activities you usually enjoy still bring you pleasure, or has that changed at all?\nPatient: The enjoyment seems to fade, like a landscape losing its colors over time. It\u2019s an interesting phenomenon\u2014how meaning shifts and sometimes dims, though the urge to seek understanding remains.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a powerful way to put it\u2014the world losing its colors. How does that fading enjoyment show up in your daily routine? Does it change how you feel about getting up or going about your day?\nPatient: It lessens the appeal of daily tasks, though I still manage to keep a rhythm. The motivation doesn\u2019t vanish entirely, but it\u2019s a quieter, more subdued drive these days.\nDoctor: Keeping a routine, even when motivation feels subdued, takes effort\u2014I respect that. How has your sleep been lately? Any trouble falling asleep, waking during the night, or feeling rested in the morning?\nPatient: Sleep is generally steady, with only the occasional mild disruption. It\u2019s not a significant concern.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that your sleep is mostly steady. How about your energy during the day\u2014do you find yourself feeling more tired or low on energy than usual, even with those nights of decent rest?\nPatient: There are moments when energy wanes, though overall it hovers within acceptable bounds\u2014nothing too disruptive to note.\nDoctor: Those moments sound subtle but real. Do you notice if the low-energy spells come at certain times of day or after specific activities? Or do they seem to come without much warning?\nPatient: They come somewhat at random, without clear cause or pattern. Yet, I continue to meet daily demands, adapting as needed.\nDoctor: I admire how you adapt to those unpredictable dips and still keep things going. When these spur-of-the-moment low-energy spells hit, how do they affect your mood or ability to get through the day?\nPatient: They cast a brief shadow over mood, though the effect passes without upending the day. I remain focused on carrying through, despite the occasional dimming.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. I want to check in about something important\u2014have you found yourself having any thoughts about death or suicide lately? This is a safe space, and anything you share helps me support you better.\nPatient: Occasionally, thoughts of death emerge\u2014not as cries for action, but as contemplations on the inevitable.

Can you tell me how often they come up, how intense they feel, and if you\u2019ve had any urges or thoughts about acting on them? It\u2019s important we keep you safe and supported.\nPatient: They occur sporadically, with little intensity. No impulses or urges accompany these reflections. I regard them as part of an ongoing meditation, not immediate concern.\nDoctor: That thoughtful perspective helps me understand better. Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt creeping in recently?\nPatient: At times, a sense of worthlessness or guilt surfaces\u2014fleeting, not engulfing. They prompt quiet reflection rather than turmoil.\nDoctor: Those moments sound like they visit quietly but leave an impression. How often do these feelings arise, and have you noticed if anything in particular tends to bring them on? How do they affect your day or how you see yourself?\nPatient: They come and go without clear cause, rarely lingering long. Their effect is more contemplative than disruptive, leaving little mark on daily life or self-perception.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings are more like passing visitors than unwelcome guests.

While DSM coverage is a priority in low-turns mode, do not sacrifice patient comfort entirely.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or help the patient feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, or ease tension\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nIn this low-turns mode, DSM is slightly preferred whenever it is a reasonable choice and there are DSM symptom keys remaining.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The last few turns of dialogue, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use when the last reply is unclear, very brief, or raises something that needs clarification.\n- Also use when the patient seems distressed and needs a moment to feel heard.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use when the patient shares something personal that deserves acknowledgment.\n- Keep concise but genuine. Can be a comment or observation, not only a question.\n\nDSM:\n- Preferred when DSM symptom keys remain and the current topic is reasonably understood.\n- Suggest a natural transition from the current conversation.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

This is your space to share whatever feels right, at a pace that works for you. Whenever you're ready, can we talk about how your mood has been lately?\nPatient: My mood dips now and then\u2014nothing I can't manage. I find myself turning inward, considering what these feelings might mean. Reflection helps, even if it doesn\u2019t change much.\nDoctor: That thoughtful reflection is important. Along with those mood shifts, have you noticed if activities you usually enjoy still bring you pleasure, or has that changed at all?\nPatient: The enjoyment seems to fade, like a landscape losing its colors over time. It\u2019s an interesting phenomenon\u2014how meaning shifts and sometimes dims, though the urge to seek understanding remains.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a powerful way to put it\u2014the world losing its colors. How does that fading enjoyment show up in your daily routine? Does it change how you feel about getting up or going about your day?\nPatient: It lessens the appeal of daily tasks, though I still manage to keep a rhythm. The motivation doesn\u2019t vanish entirely, but it\u2019s a quieter, more subdued drive these days.\nDoctor: Keeping a routine, even when motivation feels subdued, takes effort\u2014I respect that. How has your sleep been lately? Any trouble falling asleep, waking during the night, or feeling rested in the morning?\nPatient: Sleep is generally steady, with only the occasional mild disruption. It\u2019s not a significant concern.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that your sleep is mostly steady. How about your energy during the day\u2014do you find yourself feeling more tired or low on energy than usual, even with those nights of decent rest?\nPatient: There are moments when energy wanes, though overall it hovers within acceptable bounds\u2014nothing too disruptive to note.\nDoctor: Those moments sound subtle but real. Do you notice if the low-energy spells come at certain times of day or after specific activities? Or do they seem to come without much warning?\nPatient: They come somewhat at random, without clear cause or pattern. Yet, I continue to meet daily demands, adapting as needed.\nDoctor: I admire how you adapt to those unpredictable dips and still keep things going. When these spur-of-the-moment low-energy spells hit, how do they affect your mood or ability to get through the day?\nPatient: They cast a brief shadow over mood, though the effect passes without upending the day. I remain focused on carrying through, despite the occasional dimming.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. I want to check in about something important\u2014have you found yourself having any thoughts about death or suicide lately? This is a safe space, and anything you share helps me support you better.\nPatient: Occasionally, thoughts of death emerge\u2014not as cries for action, but as contemplations on the inevitable. They orbit quietly, without overwhelming presence.\nDoctor: I understand those thoughts can feel more like quiet reflections than urgent feelings. Can you tell me how often they come up, how intense they feel, and if you\u2019ve had any urges or thoughts about acting on them? It\u2019s important we keep you safe and supported.\nPatient: They occur sporadically, with little intensity. No impulses or urges accompany these reflections. I regard them as part of an ongoing meditation, not immediate concern.\nDoctor: That thoughtful perspective helps me understand better. Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt creeping in recently?\nPatient: At times, a sense of worthlessness or guilt surfaces\u2014fleeting, not engulfing. They prompt quiet reflection rather than turmoil.\nDoctor: Those moments sound like they visit quietly but leave an impression. How often do these feelings arise, and have you noticed if anything in particular tends to bring them on? How do they affect your day or how you see yourself?\nPatient: They come and go without clear cause, rarely lingering long. Their effect is more contemplative than disruptive, leaving little mark on daily life or self-perception.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings are more like passing visitors than unwelcome guests. Shifting a bit\u2014have you noticed any times when it\u2019s harder to concentrate, focus, or make decisions, even if only briefly?\nPatient: Occasionally, focus feels elusive and decisions less clear-cut. These moments pass and often spark deeper rumination rather than immediate frustration or concern.\nDoctor: Those periods of unclear focus tied to deeper thinking make sense given how reflective you are. How often do those moments come up, and do they last long enough to affect your daily tasks or mood noticeably?\nPatient: They\u2019re sporadic and brief, rarely affecting tasks or mood in any significant way.

Whenever you're ready, can we talk about how your mood has been lately?\nPatient: My mood dips now and then\u2014nothing I can't manage. I find myself turning inward, considering what these feelings might mean. Reflection helps, even if it doesn\u2019t change much.\nDoctor: That thoughtful reflection is important. Along with those mood shifts, have you noticed if activities you usually enjoy still bring you pleasure, or has that changed at all?\nPatient: The enjoyment seems to fade, like a landscape losing its colors over time.

How does that fading enjoyment show up in your daily routine? Does it change how you feel about getting up or going about your day?\nPatient: It lessens the appeal of daily tasks, though I still manage to keep a rhythm. The motivation doesn\u2019t vanish entirely, but it\u2019s a quieter, more subdued drive these days.\nDoctor: Keeping a routine, even when motivation feels subdued, takes effort\u2014I respect that. How has your sleep been lately? Any trouble falling asleep, waking during the night, or feeling rested in the morning?\nPatient: Sleep is generally steady, with only the occasional mild disruption. It\u2019s not a significant concern.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that your sleep is mostly steady. How about your energy during the day\u2014do you find yourself feeling more tired or low on energy than usual, even with those nights of decent rest?\nPatient: There are moments when energy wanes, though overall it hovers within acceptable bounds\u2014nothing too disruptive to note.\nDoctor: Those moments sound subtle but real. Do you notice if the low-energy spells come at certain times of day or after specific activities? Or do they seem to come without much warning?\nPatient: They come somewhat at random, without clear cause or pattern. Yet, I continue to meet daily demands, adapting as needed.\nDoctor: I admire how you adapt to those unpredictable dips and still keep things going. When these spur-of-the-moment low-energy spells hit, how do they affect your mood or ability to get through the day?\nPatient: They cast a brief shadow over mood, though the effect passes without upending the day. I remain focused on carrying through, despite the occasional dimming.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. I want to check in about something important\u2014have you found yourself having any thoughts about death or suicide lately? This is a safe space, and anything you share helps me support you better.\nPatient: Occasionally, thoughts of death emerge\u2014not as cries for action, but as contemplations on the inevitable. They orbit quietly, without overwhelming presence.\nDoctor: I understand those thoughts can feel more like quiet reflections than urgent feelings. Can you tell me how often they come up, how intense they feel, and if you\u2019ve had any urges or thoughts about acting on them? It\u2019s important we keep you safe and supported.\nPatient: They occur sporadically, with little intensity. No impulses or urges accompany these reflections. I regard them as part of an ongoing meditation, not immediate concern.\nDoctor: That thoughtful perspective helps me understand better. Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt creeping in recently?\nPatient: At times, a sense of worthlessness or guilt surfaces\u2014fleeting, not engulfing. They prompt quiet reflection rather than turmoil.\nDoctor: Those moments sound like they visit quietly but leave an impression. How often do these feelings arise, and have you noticed if anything in particular tends to bring them on? How do they affect your day or how you see yourself?\nPatient: They come and go without clear cause, rarely lingering long. Their effect is more contemplative than disruptive, leaving little mark on daily life or self-perception.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings are more like passing visitors than unwelcome guests. Shifting a bit\u2014have you noticed any times when it\u2019s harder to concentrate, focus, or make decisions, even if only briefly?\nPatient: Occasionally, focus feels elusive and decisions less clear-cut. These moments pass and often spark deeper rumination rather than immediate frustration or concern.\nDoctor: Those periods of unclear focus tied to deeper thinking make sense given how reflective you are. How often do those moments come up, and do they last long enough to affect your daily tasks or mood noticeably?\nPatient: They\u2019re sporadic and brief, rarely affecting tasks or mood in any significant way. Mostly, they serve as a quiet pause in the day.\nDoctor: It sounds like these pauses are manageable and don\u2019t disrupt your routine much.

I find myself turning inward, considering what these feelings might mean. Reflection helps, even if it doesn\u2019t change much.\nDoctor: That thoughtful reflection is important. Along with those mood shifts, have you noticed if activities you usually enjoy still bring you pleasure, or has that changed at all?\nPatient: The enjoyment seems to fade, like a landscape losing its colors over time. It\u2019s an interesting phenomenon\u2014how meaning shifts and sometimes dims, though the urge to seek understanding remains.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a powerful way to put it\u2014the world losing its colors. How does that fading enjoyment show up in your daily routine? Does it change how you feel about getting up or going about your day?\nPatient: It lessens the appeal of daily tasks, though I still manage to keep a rhythm. The motivation doesn\u2019t vanish entirely, but it\u2019s a quieter, more subdued drive these days.\nDoctor: Keeping a routine, even when motivation feels subdued, takes effort\u2014I respect that. How has your sleep been lately? Any trouble falling asleep, waking during the night, or feeling rested in the morning?\nPatient: Sleep is generally steady, with only the occasional mild disruption. It\u2019s not a significant concern.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that your sleep is mostly steady. How about your energy during the day\u2014do you find yourself feeling more tired or low on energy than usual, even with those nights of decent rest?\nPatient: There are moments when energy wanes, though overall it hovers within acceptable bounds\u2014nothing too disruptive to note.\nDoctor: Those moments sound subtle but real. Do you notice if the low-energy spells come at certain times of day or after specific activities? Or do they seem to come without much warning?\nPatient: They come somewhat at random, without clear cause or pattern. Yet, I continue to meet daily demands, adapting as needed.\nDoctor: I admire how you adapt to those unpredictable dips and still keep things going. When these spur-of-the-moment low-energy spells hit, how do they affect your mood or ability to get through the day?\nPatient: They cast a brief shadow over mood, though the effect passes without upending the day. I remain focused on carrying through, despite the occasional dimming.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. I want to check in about something important\u2014have you found yourself having any thoughts about death or suicide lately? This is a safe space, and anything you share helps me support you better.\nPatient: Occasionally, thoughts of death emerge\u2014not as cries for action, but as contemplations on the inevitable. They orbit quietly, without overwhelming presence.\nDoctor: I understand those thoughts can feel more like quiet reflections than urgent feelings. Can you tell me how often they come up, how intense they feel, and if you\u2019ve had any urges or thoughts about acting on them? It\u2019s important we keep you safe and supported.\nPatient: They occur sporadically, with little intensity. No impulses or urges accompany these reflections. I regard them as part of an ongoing meditation, not immediate concern.\nDoctor: That thoughtful perspective helps me understand better. Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt creeping in recently?\nPatient: At times, a sense of worthlessness or guilt surfaces\u2014fleeting, not engulfing. They prompt quiet reflection rather than turmoil.\nDoctor: Those moments sound like they visit quietly but leave an impression. How often do these feelings arise, and have you noticed if anything in particular tends to bring them on? How do they affect your day or how you see yourself?\nPatient: They come and go without clear cause, rarely lingering long. Their effect is more contemplative than disruptive, leaving little mark on daily life or self-perception.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings are more like passing visitors than unwelcome guests. Shifting a bit\u2014have you noticed any times when it\u2019s harder to concentrate, focus, or make decisions, even if only briefly?\nPatient: Occasionally, focus feels elusive and decisions less clear-cut. These moments pass and often spark deeper rumination rather than immediate frustration or concern.\nDoctor: Those periods of unclear focus tied to deeper thinking make sense given how reflective you are. How often do those moments come up, and do they last long enough to affect your daily tasks or mood noticeably?\nPatient: They\u2019re sporadic and brief, rarely affecting tasks or mood in any significant way. Mostly, they serve as a quiet pause in the day.\nDoctor: It sounds like these pauses are manageable and don\u2019t disrupt your routine much. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either gaining or losing without trying?\nPatient: Appetite and weight stay within familiar bounds, unchanged by passing tides.\nDoctor: Good to hear those have stayed steady. Have you noticed any changes in how quickly you move or think\u2014like feeling slowed down or, on the other hand, a bit restless or fidgety?\nPatient: Occasional slowdowns or restlessness appear briefly, but without notable disruption or consequence.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nOccasional slowdowns or restlessness appear briefly, but without notable disruption or consequence.",

The motivation doesn\u2019t vanish entirely, but it\u2019s a quieter, more subdued drive these days.\nDoctor: Keeping a routine, even when motivation feels subdued, takes effort\u2014I respect that. How has your sleep been lately? Any trouble falling asleep, waking during the night, or feeling rested in the morning?\nPatient: Sleep is generally steady, with only the occasional mild disruption. It\u2019s not a significant concern.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that your sleep is mostly steady. How about your energy during the day\u2014do you find yourself feeling more tired or low on energy than usual, even with those nights of decent rest?\nPatient: There are moments when energy wanes, though overall it hovers within acceptable bounds\u2014nothing too disruptive to note.\nDoctor: Those moments sound subtle but real. Do you notice if the low-energy spells come at certain times of day or after specific activities? Or do they seem to come without much warning?\nPatient: They come somewhat at random, without clear cause or pattern. Yet, I continue to meet daily demands, adapting as needed.\nDoctor: I admire how you adapt to those unpredictable dips and still keep things going. When these spur-of-the-moment low-energy spells hit, how do they affect your mood or ability to get through the day?\nPatient: They cast a brief shadow over mood, though the effect passes without upending the day. I remain focused on carrying through, despite the occasional dimming.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. I want to check in about something important\u2014have you found yourself having any thoughts about death or suicide lately? This is a safe space, and anything you share helps me support you better.\nPatient: Occasionally, thoughts of death emerge\u2014not as cries for action, but as contemplations on the inevitable. They orbit quietly, without overwhelming presence.\nDoctor: I understand those thoughts can feel more like quiet reflections than urgent feelings. Can you tell me how often they come up, how intense they feel, and if you\u2019ve had any urges or thoughts about acting on them? It\u2019s important we keep you safe and supported.\nPatient: They occur sporadically, with little intensity. No impulses or urges accompany these reflections. I regard them as part of an ongoing meditation, not immediate concern.\nDoctor: That thoughtful perspective helps me understand better. Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt creeping in recently?\nPatient: At times, a sense of worthlessness or guilt surfaces\u2014fleeting, not engulfing. They prompt quiet reflection rather than turmoil.\nDoctor: Those moments sound like they visit quietly but leave an impression. How often do these feelings arise, and have you noticed if anything in particular tends to bring them on? How do they affect your day or how you see yourself?\nPatient: They come and go without clear cause, rarely lingering long. Their effect is more contemplative than disruptive, leaving little mark on daily life or self-perception.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings are more like passing visitors than unwelcome guests. Shifting a bit\u2014have you noticed any times when it\u2019s harder to concentrate, focus, or make decisions, even if only briefly?\nPatient: Occasionally, focus feels elusive and decisions less clear-cut. These moments pass and often spark deeper rumination rather than immediate frustration or concern.\nDoctor: Those periods of unclear focus tied to deeper thinking make sense given how reflective you are. How often do those moments come up, and do they last long enough to affect your daily tasks or mood noticeably?\nPatient: They\u2019re sporadic and brief, rarely affecting tasks or mood in any significant way. Mostly, they serve as a quiet pause in the day.\nDoctor: It sounds like these pauses are manageable and don\u2019t disrupt your routine much. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either gaining or losing without trying?\nPatient: Appetite and weight stay within familiar bounds, unchanged by passing tides.\nDoctor: Good to hear those have stayed steady. Have you noticed any changes in how quickly you move or think\u2014like feeling slowed down or, on the other hand, a bit restless or fidgety?\nPatient: Occasional slowdowns or restlessness appear briefly, but without notable disruption or consequence.\nDoctor: You have a keen awareness of these subtle ebbs and flows, and that insight is valuable. I appreciate how thoughtfully you\u2019re sharing these experiences\u2014if there\u2019s anything more you\u2019d like to explore or add about how these moments feel, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: They linger at the edges, like whispers of thought rather than storms of feeling\u2014less a disruption than an ongoing meditation on existence.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nThey linger at the edges, like whispers of thought rather than storms of feeling\u2014less a disruption than an ongoing meditation on existence.",

How about your energy during the day\u2014do you find yourself feeling more tired or low on energy than usual, even with those nights of decent rest?\nPatient: There are moments when energy wanes, though overall it hovers within acceptable bounds\u2014nothing too disruptive to note.\nDoctor: Those moments sound subtle but real. Do you notice if the low-energy spells come at certain times of day or after specific activities? Or do they seem to come without much warning?\nPatient: They come somewhat at random, without clear cause or pattern. Yet, I continue to meet daily demands, adapting as needed.\nDoctor: I admire how you adapt to those unpredictable dips and still keep things going. When these spur-of-the-moment low-energy spells hit, how do they affect your mood or ability to get through the day?\nPatient: They cast a brief shadow over mood, though the effect passes without upending the day. I remain focused on carrying through, despite the occasional dimming.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. I want to check in about something important\u2014have you found yourself having any thoughts about death or suicide lately? This is a safe space, and anything you share helps me support you better.\nPatient: Occasionally, thoughts of death emerge\u2014not as cries for action, but as contemplations on the inevitable. They orbit quietly, without overwhelming presence.\nDoctor: I understand those thoughts can feel more like quiet reflections than urgent feelings. Can you tell me how often they come up, how intense they feel, and if you\u2019ve had any urges or thoughts about acting on them? It\u2019s important we keep you safe and supported.\nPatient: They occur sporadically, with little intensity. No impulses or urges accompany these reflections. I regard them as part of an ongoing meditation, not immediate concern.\nDoctor: That thoughtful perspective helps me understand better. Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt creeping in recently?\nPatient: At times, a sense of worthlessness or guilt surfaces\u2014fleeting, not engulfing. They prompt quiet reflection rather than turmoil.\nDoctor: Those moments sound like they visit quietly but leave an impression. How often do these feelings arise, and have you noticed if anything in particular tends to bring them on? How do they affect your day or how you see yourself?\nPatient: They come and go without clear cause, rarely lingering long. Their effect is more contemplative than disruptive, leaving little mark on daily life or self-perception.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings are more like passing visitors than unwelcome guests. Shifting a bit\u2014have you noticed any times when it\u2019s harder to concentrate, focus, or make decisions, even if only briefly?\nPatient: Occasionally, focus feels elusive and decisions less clear-cut. These moments pass and often spark deeper rumination rather than immediate frustration or concern.\nDoctor: Those periods of unclear focus tied to deeper thinking make sense given how reflective you are. How often do those moments come up, and do they last long enough to affect your daily tasks or mood noticeably?\nPatient: They\u2019re sporadic and brief, rarely affecting tasks or mood in any significant way. Mostly, they serve as a quiet pause in the day.\nDoctor: It sounds like these pauses are manageable and don\u2019t disrupt your routine much. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either gaining or losing without trying?\nPatient: Appetite and weight stay within familiar bounds, unchanged by passing tides.\nDoctor: Good to hear those have stayed steady. Have you noticed any changes in how quickly you move or think\u2014like feeling slowed down or, on the other hand, a bit restless or fidgety?\nPatient: Occasional slowdowns or restlessness appear briefly, but without notable disruption or consequence.\nDoctor: You have a keen awareness of these subtle ebbs and flows, and that insight is valuable. I appreciate how thoughtfully you\u2019re sharing these experiences\u2014if there\u2019s anything more you\u2019d like to explore or add about how these moments feel, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: They linger at the edges, like whispers of thought rather than storms of feeling\u2014less a disruption than an ongoing meditation on existence.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a beautifully expressed way to describe it\u2014whispers rather than storms. I\u2019m curious, how does this ongoing meditation on existence shape your days or your sense of who you are?\nPatient: It weaves a subtle tapestry\u2014each reflection adding depth, sometimes shadow, to the fabric of self.

The motivation doesn\u2019t vanish entirely, but it\u2019s a quieter, more subdued drive these days.\nDoctor: Keeping a routine, even when motivation feels subdued, takes effort\u2014I respect that. How has your sleep been lately? Any trouble falling asleep, waking during the night, or feeling rested in the morning?\nPatient: Sleep is generally steady, with only the occasional mild disruption. It\u2019s not a significant concern.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that your sleep is mostly steady. How about your energy during the day\u2014do you find yourself feeling more tired or low on energy than usual, even with those nights of decent rest?\nPatient: There are moments when energy wanes, though overall it hovers within acceptable bounds\u2014nothing too disruptive to note.\nDoctor: Those moments sound subtle but real. Do you notice if the low-energy spells come at certain times of day or after specific activities? Or do they seem to come without much warning?\nPatient: They come somewhat at random, without clear cause or pattern. Yet, I continue to meet daily demands, adapting as needed.\nDoctor: I admire how you adapt to those unpredictable dips and still keep things going. When these spur-of-the-moment low-energy spells hit, how do they affect your mood or ability to get through the day?\nPatient: They cast a brief shadow over mood, though the effect passes without upending the day. I remain focused on carrying through, despite the occasional dimming.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. I want to check in about something important\u2014have you found yourself having any thoughts about death or suicide lately? This is a safe space, and anything you share helps me support you better.\nPatient: Occasionally, thoughts of death emerge\u2014not as cries for action, but as contemplations on the inevitable. They orbit quietly, without overwhelming presence.\nDoctor: I understand those thoughts can feel more like quiet reflections than urgent feelings. Can you tell me how often they come up, how intense they feel, and if you\u2019ve had any urges or thoughts about acting on them? It\u2019s important we keep you safe and supported.\nPatient: They occur sporadically, with little intensity. No impulses or urges accompany these reflections. I regard them as part of an ongoing meditation, not immediate concern.\nDoctor: That thoughtful perspective helps me understand better. Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt creeping in recently?\nPatient: At times, a sense of worthlessness or guilt surfaces\u2014fleeting, not engulfing. They prompt quiet reflection rather than turmoil.\nDoctor: Those moments sound like they visit quietly but leave an impression. How often do these feelings arise, and have you noticed if anything in particular tends to bring them on? How do they affect your day or how you see yourself?\nPatient: They come and go without clear cause, rarely lingering long. Their effect is more contemplative than disruptive, leaving little mark on daily life or self-perception.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings are more like passing visitors than unwelcome guests. Shifting a bit\u2014have you noticed any times when it\u2019s harder to concentrate, focus, or make decisions, even if only briefly?\nPatient: Occasionally, focus feels elusive and decisions less clear-cut. These moments pass and often spark deeper rumination rather than immediate frustration or concern.\nDoctor: Those periods of unclear focus tied to deeper thinking make sense given how reflective you are. How often do those moments come up, and do they last long enough to affect your daily tasks or mood noticeably?\nPatient: They\u2019re sporadic and brief, rarely affecting tasks or mood in any significant way. Mostly, they serve as a quiet pause in the day.\nDoctor: It sounds like these pauses are manageable and don\u2019t disrupt your routine much. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either gaining or losing without trying?\nPatient: Appetite and weight stay within familiar bounds, unchanged by passing tides.\nDoctor: Good to hear those have stayed steady. Have you noticed any changes in how quickly you move or think\u2014like feeling slowed down or, on the other hand, a bit restless or fidgety?\nPatient: Occasional slowdowns or restlessness appear briefly, but without notable disruption or consequence.\nDoctor: You have a keen awareness of these subtle ebbs and flows, and that insight is valuable. I appreciate how thoughtfully you\u2019re sharing these experiences\u2014if there\u2019s anything more you\u2019d like to explore or add about how these moments feel, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: They linger at the edges, like whispers of thought rather than storms of feeling\u2014less a disruption than an ongoing meditation on existence.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a beautifully expressed way to describe it\u2014whispers rather than storms. I\u2019m curious, how does this ongoing meditation on existence shape your days or your sense of who you are?\nPatient: It weaves a subtle tapestry\u2014each reflection adding depth, sometimes shadow, to the fabric of self. It\u2019s a quiet complexity that colors my days without overwhelming.\nDoctor: That quiet complexity you describe tells me a lot. Can you tell me more about how often you feel down or empty? How do those feelings mix with your reflective thoughts? This space is safe to explore whatever you\u2019re experiencing.\nPatient: The feelings come and go, low in volume and intensity.

How does that fading enjoyment show up in your daily routine? Does it change how you feel about getting up or going about your day?\nPatient: It lessens the appeal of daily tasks, though I still manage to keep a rhythm. The motivation doesn\u2019t vanish entirely, but it\u2019s a quieter, more subdued drive these days.\nDoctor: Keeping a routine, even when motivation feels subdued, takes effort\u2014I respect that. How has your sleep been lately? Any trouble falling asleep, waking during the night, or feeling rested in the morning?\nPatient: Sleep is generally steady, with only the occasional mild disruption. It\u2019s not a significant concern.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that your sleep is mostly steady. How about your energy during the day\u2014do you find yourself feeling more tired or low on energy than usual, even with those nights of decent rest?\nPatient: There are moments when energy wanes, though overall it hovers within acceptable bounds\u2014nothing too disruptive to note.\nDoctor: Those moments sound subtle but real. Do you notice if the low-energy spells come at certain times of day or after specific activities? Or do they seem to come without much warning?\nPatient: They come somewhat at random, without clear cause or pattern. Yet, I continue to meet daily demands, adapting as needed.\nDoctor: I admire how you adapt to those unpredictable dips and still keep things going. When these spur-of-the-moment low-energy spells hit, how do they affect your mood or ability to get through the day?\nPatient: They cast a brief shadow over mood, though the effect passes without upending the day. I remain focused on carrying through, despite the occasional dimming.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. I want to check in about something important\u2014have you found yourself having any thoughts about death or suicide lately? This is a safe space, and anything you share helps me support you better.\nPatient: Occasionally, thoughts of death emerge\u2014not as cries for action, but as contemplations on the inevitable. They orbit quietly, without overwhelming presence.\nDoctor: I understand those thoughts can feel more like quiet reflections than urgent feelings. Can you tell me how often they come up, how intense they feel, and if you\u2019ve had any urges or thoughts about acting on them? It\u2019s important we keep you safe and supported.\nPatient: They occur sporadically, with little intensity. No impulses or urges accompany these reflections. I regard them as part of an ongoing meditation, not immediate concern.\nDoctor: That thoughtful perspective helps me understand better. Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt creeping in recently?\nPatient: At times, a sense of worthlessness or guilt surfaces\u2014fleeting, not engulfing. They prompt quiet reflection rather than turmoil.\nDoctor: Those moments sound like they visit quietly but leave an impression. How often do these feelings arise, and have you noticed if anything in particular tends to bring them on? How do they affect your day or how you see yourself?\nPatient: They come and go without clear cause, rarely lingering long. Their effect is more contemplative than disruptive, leaving little mark on daily life or self-perception.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings are more like passing visitors than unwelcome guests. Shifting a bit\u2014have you noticed any times when it\u2019s harder to concentrate, focus, or make decisions, even if only briefly?\nPatient: Occasionally, focus feels elusive and decisions less clear-cut. These moments pass and often spark deeper rumination rather than immediate frustration or concern.\nDoctor: Those periods of unclear focus tied to deeper thinking make sense given how reflective you are. How often do those moments come up, and do they last long enough to affect your daily tasks or mood noticeably?\nPatient: They\u2019re sporadic and brief, rarely affecting tasks or mood in any significant way. Mostly, they serve as a quiet pause in the day.\nDoctor: It sounds like these pauses are manageable and don\u2019t disrupt your routine much. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either gaining or losing without trying?\nPatient: Appetite and weight stay within familiar bounds, unchanged by passing tides.\nDoctor: Good to hear those have stayed steady. Have you noticed any changes in how quickly you move or think\u2014like feeling slowed down or, on the other hand, a bit restless or fidgety?\nPatient: Occasional slowdowns or restlessness appear briefly, but without notable disruption or consequence.\nDoctor: You have a keen awareness of these subtle ebbs and flows, and that insight is valuable. I appreciate how thoughtfully you\u2019re sharing these experiences\u2014if there\u2019s anything more you\u2019d like to explore or add about how these moments feel, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: They linger at the edges, like whispers of thought rather than storms of feeling\u2014less a disruption than an ongoing meditation on existence.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a beautifully expressed way to describe it\u2014whispers rather than storms. I\u2019m curious, how does this ongoing meditation on existence shape your days or your sense of who you are?\nPatient: It weaves a subtle tapestry\u2014each reflection adding depth, sometimes shadow, to the fabric of self. It\u2019s a quiet complexity that colors my days without overwhelming.\nDoctor: That quiet complexity you describe tells me a lot. Can you tell me more about how often you feel down or empty? How do those feelings mix with your reflective thoughts? This space is safe to explore whatever you\u2019re experiencing.\nPatient: The feelings come and go, low in volume and intensity. They coexist alongside the ongoing meditation on existence\u2014never dominating, just part of the quieter background.\nDoctor: You have a remarkable way of articulating the subtle layers you carry within\u2014a thoughtful, poetic view that shows a deep self-awareness. It takes strength and endurance to hold such complexity, and I respect the effort you make to understand yourself day by day.\nPatient: Thank you.

I'd like to check in with you about a few things today.\nPatient: Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time. I'm here to listen.\nDoctor: I appreciate you being open and here with me today. This is your space to share whatever feels right, at a pace that works for you. Whenever you're ready, can we talk about how your mood has been lately?\nPatient: My mood dips now and then\u2014nothing I can't manage. I find myself turning inward, considering what these feelings might mean. Reflection helps, even if it doesn\u2019t change much.\nDoctor: That thoughtful reflection is important. Along with those mood shifts, have you noticed if activities you usually enjoy still bring you pleasure, or has that changed at all?\nPatient: The enjoyment seems to fade, like a landscape losing its colors over time. It\u2019s an interesting phenomenon\u2014how meaning shifts and sometimes dims, though the urge to seek understanding remains.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a powerful way to put it\u2014the world losing its colors. How does that fading enjoyment show up in your daily routine? Does it change how you feel about getting up or going about your day?\nPatient: It lessens the appeal of daily tasks, though I still manage to keep a rhythm. The motivation doesn\u2019t vanish entirely, but it\u2019s a quieter, more subdued drive these days.\nDoctor: Keeping a routine, even when motivation feels subdued, takes effort\u2014I respect that. How has your sleep been lately? Any trouble falling asleep, waking during the night, or feeling rested in the morning?\nPatient: Sleep is generally steady, with only the occasional mild disruption. It\u2019s not a significant concern.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that your sleep is mostly steady. How about your energy during the day\u2014do you find yourself feeling more tired or low on energy than usual, even with those nights of decent rest?\nPatient: There are moments when energy wanes, though overall it hovers within acceptable bounds\u2014nothing too disruptive to note.\nDoctor: Those moments sound subtle but real. Do you notice if the low-energy spells come at certain times of day or after specific activities? Or do they seem to come without much warning?\nPatient: They come somewhat at random, without clear cause or pattern. Yet, I continue to meet daily demands, adapting as needed.\nDoctor: I admire how you adapt to those unpredictable dips and still keep things going. When these spur-of-the-moment low-energy spells hit, how do they affect your mood or ability to get through the day?\nPatient: They cast a brief shadow over mood, though the effect passes without upending the day. I remain focused on carrying through, despite the occasional dimming.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. I want to check in about something important\u2014have you found yourself having any thoughts about death or suicide lately? This is a safe space, and anything you share helps me support you better.\nPatient: Occasionally, thoughts of death emerge\u2014not as cries for action, but as contemplations on the inevitable. They orbit quietly, without overwhelming presence.\nDoctor: I understand those thoughts can feel more like quiet reflections than urgent feelings. Can you tell me how often they come up, how intense they feel, and if you\u2019ve had any urges or thoughts about acting on them? It\u2019s important we keep you safe and supported.\nPatient: They occur sporadically, with little intensity. No impulses or urges accompany these reflections. I regard them as part of an ongoing meditation, not immediate concern.\nDoctor: That thoughtful perspective helps me understand better. Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt creeping in recently?\nPatient: At times, a sense of worthlessness or guilt surfaces\u2014fleeting, not engulfing. They prompt quiet reflection rather than turmoil.\nDoctor: Those moments sound like they visit quietly but leave an impression. How often do these feelings arise, and have you noticed if anything in particular tends to bring them on? How do they affect your day or how you see yourself?\nPatient: They come and go without clear cause, rarely lingering long. Their effect is more contemplative than disruptive, leaving little mark on daily life or self-perception.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings are more like passing visitors than unwelcome guests. Shifting a bit\u2014have you noticed any times when it\u2019s harder to concentrate, focus, or make decisions, even if only briefly?\nPatient: Occasionally, focus feels elusive and decisions less clear-cut. These moments pass and often spark deeper rumination rather than immediate frustration or concern.\nDoctor: Those periods of unclear focus tied to deeper thinking make sense given how reflective you are. How often do those moments come up, and do they last long enough to affect your daily tasks or mood noticeably?\nPatient: They\u2019re sporadic and brief, rarely affecting tasks or mood in any significant way. Mostly, they serve as a quiet pause in the day.\nDoctor: It sounds like these pauses are manageable and don\u2019t disrupt your routine much. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either gaining or losing without trying?\nPatient: Appetite and weight stay within familiar bounds, unchanged by passing tides.\nDoctor: Good to hear those have stayed steady. Have you noticed any changes in how quickly you move or think\u2014like feeling slowed down or, on the other hand, a bit restless or fidgety?\nPatient: Occasional slowdowns or restlessness appear briefly, but without notable disruption or consequence.\nDoctor: You have a keen awareness of these subtle ebbs and flows, and that insight is valuable. I appreciate how thoughtfully you\u2019re sharing these experiences\u2014if there\u2019s anything more you\u2019d like to explore or add about how these moments feel, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: They linger at the edges, like whispers of thought rather than storms of feeling\u2014less a disruption than an ongoing meditation on existence.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a beautifully expressed way to describe it\u2014whispers rather than storms. I\u2019m curious, how does this ongoing meditation on existence shape your days or your sense of who you are?\nPatient: It weaves a subtle tapestry\u2014each reflection adding depth, sometimes shadow, to the fabric of self. It\u2019s a quiet complexity that colors my days without overwhelming.\nDoctor: That quiet complexity you describe tells me a lot. Can you tell me more about how often you feel down or empty? How do those feelings mix with your reflective thoughts? This space is safe to explore whatever you\u2019re experiencing.\nPatient: The feelings come and go, low in volume and intensity. They coexist alongside the ongoing meditation on existence\u2014never dominating, just part of the quieter background.\nDoctor: You have a remarkable way of articulating the subtle layers you carry within\u2014a thoughtful, poetic view that shows a deep self-awareness. It takes strength and endurance to hold such complexity, and I respect the effort you make to understand yourself day by day.\nPatient: Thank you. I find value in this quiet endurance and the chance to observe myself with some measure of clarity.\nDoctor: Your strength and insight shine through clearly\u2014it\u2019s not easy to maintain that level of self-awareness and endurance. Remember, your reflective nature is a valuable part of who you are, and support is here whenever you want it.\nPatient: I appreciate your words. Reflection is a steady companion, and support, when needed, is noted.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
