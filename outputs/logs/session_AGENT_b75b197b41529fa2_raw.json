Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

Other than that, things are pretty much the same.\nDoctor: You mentioned trouble sleeping a few nights a week\u2014can you tell me more about that? Are you having trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up earlier than you'd like? And about how many nights a week would you say this happens?\nPatient: Mostly, I wake up during the night. It happens around three nights a week.

Are you feeling more fatigued or having less energy than usual?\nPatient: I do feel a bit tired sometimes, but it\u2019s manageable.

Still, do you notice if this fatigue sometimes makes it harder to concentrate, affects your mood, or lessens your motivation at certain points in the day?\nPatient: Fatigue's there, but it\u2019s not stopping me from focusing or getting things done. Doesn\u2019t really change how I feel, either.\nDoctor: Understood.

Have you experienced any of those thoughts recently? It helps me get a full picture to support you best.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that.\nDoctor: Thanks for telling me. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: Yes, my appetite\u2019s been changing quite a bit. Sometimes I eat less, sometimes more. It\u2019s been happening often enough to notice.\nDoctor: Got it. How long have these appetite changes been going on? Have you noticed any pattern or trigger? And has this affected your weight or how you manage your daily activities at all?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a few months. No clear pattern or trigger I can point to.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Hello. Lately, I've been having some trouble sleeping a few nights a week, and it leaves me a bit tired during the day sometimes. Other than that, things are pretty much the same.\nDoctor: You mentioned trouble sleeping a few nights a week\u2014can you tell me more about that? Are you having trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up earlier than you'd like? And about how many nights a week would you say this happens?\nPatient: Mostly, I wake up during the night. It happens around three nights a week. Nothing more than that.\nDoctor: Waking up like that can definitely wear you down. How does this affect your energy during the day? Are you feeling more fatigued or having less energy than usual?\nPatient: I do feel a bit tired sometimes, but it\u2019s manageable. It doesn\u2019t really get in the way of what I need to do.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that the tiredness isn\u2019t overwhelming. Still, do you notice if this fatigue sometimes makes it harder to concentrate, affects your mood, or lessens your motivation at certain points in the day?\nPatient: Fatigue's there, but it\u2019s not stopping me from focusing or getting things done. Doesn\u2019t really change how I feel, either.\nDoctor: Understood. Even if mild, have you noticed any recent trouble concentrating or making decisions\u2014maybe while handling daily tasks or during your caregiving duties?\nPatient: No, concentrating and deciding hasn\u2019t been a problem. Things are steady there.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. Shifting gears a bit\u2014how has your overall mood been lately? Have you been feeling down, sad, or more low than usual at all?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t been feeling down or sad. My mood\u2019s been steady.\nDoctor: Got it. Let\u2019s check on something else\u2014have you noticed any loss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t lost interest or pleasure in anything.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. How about feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt\u2014have those been coming up for you at all?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t felt worthless or guilty.\nDoctor: I want to ask an important question I go over with everyone\u2014it\u2019s about any thoughts of death, dying, or suicide. Have you experienced any of those thoughts recently? It helps me get a full picture to support you best.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that.\nDoctor: Thanks for telling me. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: Yes, my appetite\u2019s been changing quite a bit. Sometimes I eat less, sometimes more. It\u2019s been happening often enough to notice.\nDoctor: Got it. How long have these appetite changes been going on? Have you noticed any pattern or trigger? And has this affected your weight or how you manage your daily activities at all?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a few months. No clear pattern or trigger I can point to. My weight\u2019s gone up and down a bit, but it hasn\u2019t really affected my daily activities.\nDoctor: When you say it happens \u201coften enough,\u201d about how frequently would you say your appetite shifts between eating more and less? Do these changes come on suddenly, or do they build up gradually over time?\nPatient: It happens a few times a week. The shifts come on gradually. Weight goes up and down, but it hasn\u2019t really affected daily life.\nDoctor: It sounds like those appetite and weight swings can be a bit challenging, even if your daily routine stays steady. When these shifts happen, do you notice any changes in how you feel emotionally\u2014like early signs of stress, low mood, or anything else?\nPatient: No, those changes haven\u2019t affected how I feel emotionally. They just happen over time.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying. Have you noticed any changes in your movement or activity levels recently\u2014like feeling more restless than usual, or maybe slowed down or sluggish?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in that.\nDoctor: Understood. Since waking up around three nights a week is part of your experience, can you tell me if these awakenings make it hard to fall back asleep? Have you tried anything to help improve your sleep, and if so, how\u2019s that been working?\nPatient: Yeah, waking up those nights makes it a bit hard to get back to sleep sometimes. I\u2019ve tried things like changing my bedtime and cutting out caffeine, but it\u2019s just okay. I manage.\nDoctor: I appreciate the effort you\u2019re putting into managing your sleep\u2014that can be tough, even when symptoms feel mild. It\u2019s good you\u2019re open about it, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to support you through this.\nPatient: Thanks, I appreciate that.
