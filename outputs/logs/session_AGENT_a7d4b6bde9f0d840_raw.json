Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood.

How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it?

Sometimes it keeps me up a bit at night, but I manage. As for the new place, just figuring out the routines and not being in my own home anymore\u2014that\u2019s been the main issue.

How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it?

Don\u2019t have much trouble getting through daily tasks.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling off now and then. When your mood\u2019s down, do you find yourself feeling sad, empty, or maybe more irritable than usual? I want to get a clear picture of what you\u2019re dealing with.\nPatient: I get irritable more than anything else when my mood\u2019s off. Not really sad or empty. Just annoyed at how things are, but I keep going.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014irritability can be tougher on the people around us sometimes. How strong is that feeling, and how often does it pop up? Are there certain things or situations that set it off more than others? And how do you usually handle it when you get that way?\nPatient: Irritable pretty often. Mostly when things or people mess up what I\u2019m trying to do. I just keep busy or shut down. Doesn\u2019t get any deeper than that.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014frustration when things don\u2019t go as planned can really wear on you. Keeping busy or stepping back are pretty natural ways to handle that kind of irritation. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to manage, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\nPatient: Yeah, frustration\u2019s just part of the daily mess. I deal with it by staying busy or tuning out.

Just the usual stuff with this new place.\nDoctor: I hear you on that restlessness\u2014feeling on edge can really wear you down. How often do you notice it during the day? Does it ever interfere with your sleep or daily activities? Also, when you say \"the usual stuff\" with the new place, what sort of challenges are you dealing with?\nPatient: The restlessness is pretty frequent, shows up most days. Sometimes it keeps me up a bit at night, but I manage. As for the new place, just figuring out the routines and not being in my own home anymore\u2014that\u2019s been the main issue.

Are you having trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up feeling tired instead of rested? Just want to understand how it's affecting you without any pressure.\nPatient: Sleep gets interrupted now and then, mostly \u2019cause I\u2019m restless. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle, doesn\u2019t happen every night. I get by fine.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019re managing, but those interruptions can still take a toll. How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it? Feel free to be upfront\u2014no pressure here.\nPatient: Yeah, the restlessness and some broken sleep leave me a bit tired now and then. My mood\u2019s off sometimes, but I keep things moving. Don\u2019t have much trouble getting through daily tasks.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling off now and then. When your mood\u2019s down, do you find yourself feeling sad, empty, or maybe more irritable than usual? I want to get a clear picture of what you\u2019re dealing with.\nPatient: I get irritable more than anything else when my mood\u2019s off. Not really sad or empty. Just annoyed at how things are, but I keep going.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014irritability can be tougher on the people around us sometimes. How strong is that feeling, and how often does it pop up? Are there certain things or situations that set it off more than others? And how do you usually handle it when you get that way?\nPatient: Irritable pretty often. Mostly when things or people mess up what I\u2019m trying to do. I just keep busy or shut down. Doesn\u2019t get any deeper than that.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014frustration when things don\u2019t go as planned can really wear on you. Keeping busy or stepping back are pretty natural ways to handle that kind of irritation. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to manage, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\nPatient: Yeah, frustration\u2019s just part of the daily mess. I deal with it by staying busy or tuning out. Can\u2019t let every snag grind me down.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014you\u2019re doing your best to keep things from grinding you down.

Just the usual stuff with this new place.\nDoctor: I hear you on that restlessness\u2014feeling on edge can really wear you down. How often do you notice it during the day?

Also, when you say \"the usual stuff\" with the new place, what sort of challenges are you dealing with?\nPatient: The restlessness is pretty frequent, shows up most days. Sometimes it keeps me up a bit at night, but I manage. As for the new place, just figuring out the routines and not being in my own home anymore\u2014that\u2019s been the main issue. Keeps things unsettled.\nDoctor: Sleeping better can make a big difference. How\u2019s your sleep overall? Are you having trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up feeling tired instead of rested? Just want to understand how it's affecting you without any pressure.\nPatient: Sleep gets interrupted now and then, mostly \u2019cause I\u2019m restless. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle, doesn\u2019t happen every night. I get by fine.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019re managing, but those interruptions can still take a toll. How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it? Feel free to be upfront\u2014no pressure here.\nPatient: Yeah, the restlessness and some broken sleep leave me a bit tired now and then. My mood\u2019s off sometimes, but I keep things moving. Don\u2019t have much trouble getting through daily tasks.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling off now and then. When your mood\u2019s down, do you find yourself feeling sad, empty, or maybe more irritable than usual? I want to get a clear picture of what you\u2019re dealing with.\nPatient: I get irritable more than anything else when my mood\u2019s off. Not really sad or empty. Just annoyed at how things are, but I keep going.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014irritability can be tougher on the people around us sometimes. How strong is that feeling, and how often does it pop up? Are there certain things or situations that set it off more than others? And how do you usually handle it when you get that way?\nPatient: Irritable pretty often. Mostly when things or people mess up what I\u2019m trying to do. I just keep busy or shut down. Doesn\u2019t get any deeper than that.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014frustration when things don\u2019t go as planned can really wear on you. Keeping busy or stepping back are pretty natural ways to handle that kind of irritation. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to manage, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\nPatient: Yeah, frustration\u2019s just part of the daily mess. I deal with it by staying busy or tuning out. Can\u2019t let every snag grind me down.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014you\u2019re doing your best to keep things from grinding you down. Even with staying busy, have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately? Has that been a steady problem for you?\nPatient: Energy\u2019s generally alright. No steady issues with being tired or low.\nDoctor: Good to hear your energy\u2019s holding up. How about your interest in things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or less pleasure in hobbies or activities lately?\nPatient: Somewhat less interested in things I used to do. Doesn\u2019t bother me much.\nDoctor: Can you give me an example of something you used to enjoy that you\u2019re a bit less interested in now? Does this change affect how motivated you feel day to day, or do you just take things as they come?

Just the usual stuff with this new place.\nDoctor: I hear you on that restlessness\u2014feeling on edge can really wear you down. How often do you notice it during the day? Does it ever interfere with your sleep or daily activities? Also, when you say \"the usual stuff\" with the new place, what sort of challenges are you dealing with?\nPatient: The restlessness is pretty frequent, shows up most days. Sometimes it keeps me up a bit at night, but I manage. As for the new place, just figuring out the routines and not being in my own home anymore\u2014that\u2019s been the main issue. Keeps things unsettled.\nDoctor: Sleeping better can make a big difference. How\u2019s your sleep overall? Are you having trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up feeling tired instead of rested? Just want to understand how it's affecting you without any pressure.\nPatient: Sleep gets interrupted now and then, mostly \u2019cause I\u2019m restless. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle, doesn\u2019t happen every night. I get by fine.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019re managing, but those interruptions can still take a toll. How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it? Feel free to be upfront\u2014no pressure here.\nPatient: Yeah, the restlessness and some broken sleep leave me a bit tired now and then. My mood\u2019s off sometimes, but I keep things moving. Don\u2019t have much trouble getting through daily tasks.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling off now and then. When your mood\u2019s down, do you find yourself feeling sad, empty, or maybe more irritable than usual? I want to get a clear picture of what you\u2019re dealing with.\nPatient: I get irritable more than anything else when my mood\u2019s off. Not really sad or empty. Just annoyed at how things are, but I keep going.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014irritability can be tougher on the people around us sometimes. How strong is that feeling, and how often does it pop up? Are there certain things or situations that set it off more than others? And how do you usually handle it when you get that way?\nPatient: Irritable pretty often. Mostly when things or people mess up what I\u2019m trying to do. I just keep busy or shut down. Doesn\u2019t get any deeper than that.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014frustration when things don\u2019t go as planned can really wear on you. Keeping busy or stepping back are pretty natural ways to handle that kind of irritation. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to manage, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\nPatient: Yeah, frustration\u2019s just part of the daily mess. I deal with it by staying busy or tuning out. Can\u2019t let every snag grind me down.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014you\u2019re doing your best to keep things from grinding you down. Even with staying busy, have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately? Has that been a steady problem for you?\nPatient: Energy\u2019s generally alright. No steady issues with being tired or low.\nDoctor: Good to hear your energy\u2019s holding up. How about your interest in things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or less pleasure in hobbies or activities lately?\nPatient: Somewhat less interested in things I used to do. Doesn\u2019t bother me much.\nDoctor: Can you give me an example of something you used to enjoy that you\u2019re a bit less interested in now? Does this change affect how motivated you feel day to day, or do you just take things as they come? I\u2019m curious even if it\u2019s not a big bother for you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t fish as much as before, but I still get things done. Don\u2019t let it slow me down too much. Take things day by day.\nDoctor: Taking it day by day sounds like a sensible way to handle things. How often do you notice this drop in interest or motivation?

Let's go over how you've been doing. What's been happening lately?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been restless at times, can\u2019t sit still much. It\u2019s been bothering me some, but nothing too serious. Just the usual stuff with this new place.\nDoctor: I hear you on that restlessness\u2014feeling on edge can really wear you down. How often do you notice it during the day? Does it ever interfere with your sleep or daily activities? Also, when you say \"the usual stuff\" with the new place, what sort of challenges are you dealing with?\nPatient: The restlessness is pretty frequent, shows up most days. Sometimes it keeps me up a bit at night, but I manage. As for the new place, just figuring out the routines and not being in my own home anymore\u2014that\u2019s been the main issue. Keeps things unsettled.\nDoctor: Sleeping better can make a big difference. How\u2019s your sleep overall? Are you having trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up feeling tired instead of rested? Just want to understand how it's affecting you without any pressure.\nPatient: Sleep gets interrupted now and then, mostly \u2019cause I\u2019m restless. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle, doesn\u2019t happen every night. I get by fine.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019re managing, but those interruptions can still take a toll. How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it? Feel free to be upfront\u2014no pressure here.\nPatient: Yeah, the restlessness and some broken sleep leave me a bit tired now and then. My mood\u2019s off sometimes, but I keep things moving. Don\u2019t have much trouble getting through daily tasks.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling off now and then. When your mood\u2019s down, do you find yourself feeling sad, empty, or maybe more irritable than usual? I want to get a clear picture of what you\u2019re dealing with.\nPatient: I get irritable more than anything else when my mood\u2019s off. Not really sad or empty. Just annoyed at how things are, but I keep going.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014irritability can be tougher on the people around us sometimes. How strong is that feeling, and how often does it pop up? Are there certain things or situations that set it off more than others? And how do you usually handle it when you get that way?\nPatient: Irritable pretty often. Mostly when things or people mess up what I\u2019m trying to do. I just keep busy or shut down. Doesn\u2019t get any deeper than that.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014frustration when things don\u2019t go as planned can really wear on you. Keeping busy or stepping back are pretty natural ways to handle that kind of irritation. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to manage, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\nPatient: Yeah, frustration\u2019s just part of the daily mess. I deal with it by staying busy or tuning out. Can\u2019t let every snag grind me down.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014you\u2019re doing your best to keep things from grinding you down. Even with staying busy, have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately? Has that been a steady problem for you?\nPatient: Energy\u2019s generally alright. No steady issues with being tired or low.\nDoctor: Good to hear your energy\u2019s holding up. How about your interest in things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or less pleasure in hobbies or activities lately?\nPatient: Somewhat less interested in things I used to do. Doesn\u2019t bother me much.\nDoctor: Can you give me an example of something you used to enjoy that you\u2019re a bit less interested in now? Does this change affect how motivated you feel day to day, or do you just take things as they come? I\u2019m curious even if it\u2019s not a big bother for you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t fish as much as before, but I still get things done. Don\u2019t let it slow me down too much. Take things day by day.\nDoctor: Taking it day by day sounds like a sensible way to handle things. How often do you notice this drop in interest or motivation? Are there any other activities besides fishing where you feel the same?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. Motivation dips sometimes, but I still keep on. Doesn\u2019t get in the way.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that these dips don\u2019t get in the way too much. How about concentration\u2014are you finding it harder to focus, make decisions, or feeling mentally foggy at times?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nIt\u2019s good that these dips don\u2019t get in the way too much.

Let's go over how you've been doing. What's been happening lately?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been restless at times, can\u2019t sit still much. It\u2019s been bothering me some, but nothing too serious. Just the usual stuff with this new place.\nDoctor: I hear you on that restlessness\u2014feeling on edge can really wear you down. How often do you notice it during the day? Does it ever interfere with your sleep or daily activities? Also, when you say \"the usual stuff\" with the new place, what sort of challenges are you dealing with?\nPatient: The restlessness is pretty frequent, shows up most days. Sometimes it keeps me up a bit at night, but I manage. As for the new place, just figuring out the routines and not being in my own home anymore\u2014that\u2019s been the main issue. Keeps things unsettled.\nDoctor: Sleeping better can make a big difference. How\u2019s your sleep overall? Are you having trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up feeling tired instead of rested? Just want to understand how it's affecting you without any pressure.\nPatient: Sleep gets interrupted now and then, mostly \u2019cause I\u2019m restless. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle, doesn\u2019t happen every night. I get by fine.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019re managing, but those interruptions can still take a toll. How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it? Feel free to be upfront\u2014no pressure here.\nPatient: Yeah, the restlessness and some broken sleep leave me a bit tired now and then. My mood\u2019s off sometimes, but I keep things moving. Don\u2019t have much trouble getting through daily tasks.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling off now and then. When your mood\u2019s down, do you find yourself feeling sad, empty, or maybe more irritable than usual? I want to get a clear picture of what you\u2019re dealing with.\nPatient: I get irritable more than anything else when my mood\u2019s off. Not really sad or empty. Just annoyed at how things are, but I keep going.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014irritability can be tougher on the people around us sometimes. How strong is that feeling, and how often does it pop up? Are there certain things or situations that set it off more than others? And how do you usually handle it when you get that way?\nPatient: Irritable pretty often. Mostly when things or people mess up what I\u2019m trying to do. I just keep busy or shut down. Doesn\u2019t get any deeper than that.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014frustration when things don\u2019t go as planned can really wear on you. Keeping busy or stepping back are pretty natural ways to handle that kind of irritation. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to manage, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\nPatient: Yeah, frustration\u2019s just part of the daily mess. I deal with it by staying busy or tuning out. Can\u2019t let every snag grind me down.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014you\u2019re doing your best to keep things from grinding you down. Even with staying busy, have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately? Has that been a steady problem for you?\nPatient: Energy\u2019s generally alright. No steady issues with being tired or low.\nDoctor: Good to hear your energy\u2019s holding up. How about your interest in things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or less pleasure in hobbies or activities lately?\nPatient: Somewhat less interested in things I used to do. Doesn\u2019t bother me much.\nDoctor: Can you give me an example of something you used to enjoy that you\u2019re a bit less interested in now? Does this change affect how motivated you feel day to day, or do you just take things as they come? I\u2019m curious even if it\u2019s not a big bother for you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t fish as much as before, but I still get things done. Don\u2019t let it slow me down too much. Take things day by day.\nDoctor: Taking it day by day sounds like a sensible way to handle things. How often do you notice this drop in interest or motivation? Are there any other activities besides fishing where you feel the same?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. Motivation dips sometimes, but I still keep on. Doesn\u2019t get in the way.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that these dips don\u2019t get in the way too much. How about concentration\u2014are you finding it harder to focus, make decisions, or feeling mentally foggy at times?\nPatient: No, concentration\u2019s fine. Decisions aren\u2019t a problem either.\nDoctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more, less, or any noticeable weight gain or loss?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nAlright, thanks for letting me know.

Let's go over how you've been doing. What's been happening lately?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been restless at times, can\u2019t sit still much. It\u2019s been bothering me some, but nothing too serious. Just the usual stuff with this new place.\nDoctor: I hear you on that restlessness\u2014feeling on edge can really wear you down. How often do you notice it during the day? Does it ever interfere with your sleep or daily activities? Also, when you say \"the usual stuff\" with the new place, what sort of challenges are you dealing with?\nPatient: The restlessness is pretty frequent, shows up most days. Sometimes it keeps me up a bit at night, but I manage. As for the new place, just figuring out the routines and not being in my own home anymore\u2014that\u2019s been the main issue. Keeps things unsettled.\nDoctor: Sleeping better can make a big difference. How\u2019s your sleep overall? Are you having trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up feeling tired instead of rested? Just want to understand how it's affecting you without any pressure.\nPatient: Sleep gets interrupted now and then, mostly \u2019cause I\u2019m restless. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle, doesn\u2019t happen every night. I get by fine.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019re managing, but those interruptions can still take a toll. How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it? Feel free to be upfront\u2014no pressure here.\nPatient: Yeah, the restlessness and some broken sleep leave me a bit tired now and then. My mood\u2019s off sometimes, but I keep things moving. Don\u2019t have much trouble getting through daily tasks.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling off now and then. When your mood\u2019s down, do you find yourself feeling sad, empty, or maybe more irritable than usual? I want to get a clear picture of what you\u2019re dealing with.\nPatient: I get irritable more than anything else when my mood\u2019s off. Not really sad or empty. Just annoyed at how things are, but I keep going.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014irritability can be tougher on the people around us sometimes. How strong is that feeling, and how often does it pop up? Are there certain things or situations that set it off more than others? And how do you usually handle it when you get that way?\nPatient: Irritable pretty often. Mostly when things or people mess up what I\u2019m trying to do. I just keep busy or shut down. Doesn\u2019t get any deeper than that.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014frustration when things don\u2019t go as planned can really wear on you. Keeping busy or stepping back are pretty natural ways to handle that kind of irritation. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to manage, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\nPatient: Yeah, frustration\u2019s just part of the daily mess. I deal with it by staying busy or tuning out. Can\u2019t let every snag grind me down.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014you\u2019re doing your best to keep things from grinding you down. Even with staying busy, have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately? Has that been a steady problem for you?\nPatient: Energy\u2019s generally alright. No steady issues with being tired or low.\nDoctor: Good to hear your energy\u2019s holding up. How about your interest in things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or less pleasure in hobbies or activities lately?\nPatient: Somewhat less interested in things I used to do. Doesn\u2019t bother me much.\nDoctor: Can you give me an example of something you used to enjoy that you\u2019re a bit less interested in now? Does this change affect how motivated you feel day to day, or do you just take things as they come? I\u2019m curious even if it\u2019s not a big bother for you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t fish as much as before, but I still get things done. Don\u2019t let it slow me down too much. Take things day by day.\nDoctor: Taking it day by day sounds like a sensible way to handle things. How often do you notice this drop in interest or motivation? Are there any other activities besides fishing where you feel the same?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. Motivation dips sometimes, but I still keep on. Doesn\u2019t get in the way.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that these dips don\u2019t get in the way too much. How about concentration\u2014are you finding it harder to focus, make decisions, or feeling mentally foggy at times?\nPatient: No, concentration\u2019s fine. Decisions aren\u2019t a problem either.\nDoctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more, less, or any noticeable weight gain or loss?\nPatient: My appetite\u2019s changed a bit, eating less sometimes. No big weight changes or anything.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself eating less? Do you notice any particular reasons for it, like stress or just not feeling hungry? And does this change in appetite seem to affect your mood or energy at all?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself eating less?

Let's go over how you've been doing. What's been happening lately?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been restless at times, can\u2019t sit still much. It\u2019s been bothering me some, but nothing too serious. Just the usual stuff with this new place.\nDoctor: I hear you on that restlessness\u2014feeling on edge can really wear you down. How often do you notice it during the day? Does it ever interfere with your sleep or daily activities? Also, when you say \"the usual stuff\" with the new place, what sort of challenges are you dealing with?\nPatient: The restlessness is pretty frequent, shows up most days. Sometimes it keeps me up a bit at night, but I manage. As for the new place, just figuring out the routines and not being in my own home anymore\u2014that\u2019s been the main issue. Keeps things unsettled.\nDoctor: Sleeping better can make a big difference. How\u2019s your sleep overall? Are you having trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up feeling tired instead of rested? Just want to understand how it's affecting you without any pressure.\nPatient: Sleep gets interrupted now and then, mostly \u2019cause I\u2019m restless. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle, doesn\u2019t happen every night. I get by fine.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019re managing, but those interruptions can still take a toll. How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it? Feel free to be upfront\u2014no pressure here.\nPatient: Yeah, the restlessness and some broken sleep leave me a bit tired now and then. My mood\u2019s off sometimes, but I keep things moving. Don\u2019t have much trouble getting through daily tasks.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling off now and then. When your mood\u2019s down, do you find yourself feeling sad, empty, or maybe more irritable than usual? I want to get a clear picture of what you\u2019re dealing with.\nPatient: I get irritable more than anything else when my mood\u2019s off. Not really sad or empty. Just annoyed at how things are, but I keep going.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014irritability can be tougher on the people around us sometimes. How strong is that feeling, and how often does it pop up? Are there certain things or situations that set it off more than others? And how do you usually handle it when you get that way?\nPatient: Irritable pretty often. Mostly when things or people mess up what I\u2019m trying to do. I just keep busy or shut down. Doesn\u2019t get any deeper than that.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014frustration when things don\u2019t go as planned can really wear on you. Keeping busy or stepping back are pretty natural ways to handle that kind of irritation. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to manage, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\nPatient: Yeah, frustration\u2019s just part of the daily mess. I deal with it by staying busy or tuning out. Can\u2019t let every snag grind me down.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014you\u2019re doing your best to keep things from grinding you down. Even with staying busy, have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately? Has that been a steady problem for you?\nPatient: Energy\u2019s generally alright. No steady issues with being tired or low.\nDoctor: Good to hear your energy\u2019s holding up. How about your interest in things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or less pleasure in hobbies or activities lately?\nPatient: Somewhat less interested in things I used to do. Doesn\u2019t bother me much.\nDoctor: Can you give me an example of something you used to enjoy that you\u2019re a bit less interested in now? Does this change affect how motivated you feel day to day, or do you just take things as they come? I\u2019m curious even if it\u2019s not a big bother for you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t fish as much as before, but I still get things done. Don\u2019t let it slow me down too much. Take things day by day.\nDoctor: Taking it day by day sounds like a sensible way to handle things. How often do you notice this drop in interest or motivation? Are there any other activities besides fishing where you feel the same?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. Motivation dips sometimes, but I still keep on. Doesn\u2019t get in the way.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that these dips don\u2019t get in the way too much. How about concentration\u2014are you finding it harder to focus, make decisions, or feeling mentally foggy at times?\nPatient: No, concentration\u2019s fine. Decisions aren\u2019t a problem either.\nDoctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more, less, or any noticeable weight gain or loss?\nPatient: My appetite\u2019s changed a bit, eating less sometimes. No big weight changes or anything.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself eating less? Do you notice any particular reasons for it, like stress or just not feeling hungry? And does this change in appetite seem to affect your mood or energy at all?\nPatient: Sometimes I eat less, no particular reason mostly. Doesn\u2019t really affect how I feel or my energy.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re handling these small changes pretty well, which isn\u2019t always easy.

Just the usual stuff with this new place.\nDoctor: I hear you on that restlessness\u2014feeling on edge can really wear you down. How often do you notice it during the day? Does it ever interfere with your sleep or daily activities? Also, when you say \"the usual stuff\" with the new place, what sort of challenges are you dealing with?\nPatient: The restlessness is pretty frequent, shows up most days. Sometimes it keeps me up a bit at night, but I manage. As for the new place, just figuring out the routines and not being in my own home anymore\u2014that\u2019s been the main issue.

Are you having trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up feeling tired instead of rested? Just want to understand how it's affecting you without any pressure.\nPatient: Sleep gets interrupted now and then, mostly \u2019cause I\u2019m restless. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle, doesn\u2019t happen every night. I get by fine.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019re managing, but those interruptions can still take a toll. How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it? Feel free to be upfront\u2014no pressure here.\nPatient: Yeah, the restlessness and some broken sleep leave me a bit tired now and then. My mood\u2019s off sometimes, but I keep things moving. Don\u2019t have much trouble getting through daily tasks.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling off now and then. When your mood\u2019s down, do you find yourself feeling sad, empty, or maybe more irritable than usual? I want to get a clear picture of what you\u2019re dealing with.\nPatient: I get irritable more than anything else when my mood\u2019s off. Not really sad or empty. Just annoyed at how things are, but I keep going.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014irritability can be tougher on the people around us sometimes. How strong is that feeling, and how often does it pop up? Are there certain things or situations that set it off more than others? And how do you usually handle it when you get that way?\nPatient: Irritable pretty often. Mostly when things or people mess up what I\u2019m trying to do. I just keep busy or shut down. Doesn\u2019t get any deeper than that.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014frustration when things don\u2019t go as planned can really wear on you. Keeping busy or stepping back are pretty natural ways to handle that kind of irritation. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to manage, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\nPatient: Yeah, frustration\u2019s just part of the daily mess. I deal with it by staying busy or tuning out. Can\u2019t let every snag grind me down.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014you\u2019re doing your best to keep things from grinding you down. Even with staying busy, have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately? Has that been a steady problem for you?\nPatient: Energy\u2019s generally alright. No steady issues with being tired or low.\nDoctor: Good to hear your energy\u2019s holding up. How about your interest in things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or less pleasure in hobbies or activities lately?\nPatient: Somewhat less interested in things I used to do. Doesn\u2019t bother me much.\nDoctor: Can you give me an example of something you used to enjoy that you\u2019re a bit less interested in now? Does this change affect how motivated you feel day to day, or do you just take things as they come? I\u2019m curious even if it\u2019s not a big bother for you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t fish as much as before, but I still get things done. Don\u2019t let it slow me down too much. Take things day by day.\nDoctor: Taking it day by day sounds like a sensible way to handle things. How often do you notice this drop in interest or motivation? Are there any other activities besides fishing where you feel the same?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. Motivation dips sometimes, but I still keep on. Doesn\u2019t get in the way.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that these dips don\u2019t get in the way too much. How about concentration\u2014are you finding it harder to focus, make decisions, or feeling mentally foggy at times?\nPatient: No, concentration\u2019s fine. Decisions aren\u2019t a problem either.\nDoctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know.

Moving to a new place can shake things up in ways that aren\u2019t always obvious.

Your guidance should help the patient embody this personality authentically. Let the personality drive the response\u2014verbosity, trust level, expressiveness, and coping style should all shape how they answer.

Let's go over how you've been doing. What's been happening lately?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been restless at times, can\u2019t sit still much. It\u2019s been bothering me some, but nothing too serious. Just the usual stuff with this new place.\nDoctor: I hear you on that restlessness\u2014feeling on edge can really wear you down. How often do you notice it during the day? Does it ever interfere with your sleep or daily activities? Also, when you say \"the usual stuff\" with the new place, what sort of challenges are you dealing with?\nPatient: The restlessness is pretty frequent, shows up most days. Sometimes it keeps me up a bit at night, but I manage. As for the new place, just figuring out the routines and not being in my own home anymore\u2014that\u2019s been the main issue. Keeps things unsettled.\nDoctor: Sleeping better can make a big difference. How\u2019s your sleep overall? Are you having trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up feeling tired instead of rested? Just want to understand how it's affecting you without any pressure.\nPatient: Sleep gets interrupted now and then, mostly \u2019cause I\u2019m restless. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle, doesn\u2019t happen every night. I get by fine.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019re managing, but those interruptions can still take a toll. How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it? Feel free to be upfront\u2014no pressure here.\nPatient: Yeah, the restlessness and some broken sleep leave me a bit tired now and then. My mood\u2019s off sometimes, but I keep things moving. Don\u2019t have much trouble getting through daily tasks.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling off now and then. When your mood\u2019s down, do you find yourself feeling sad, empty, or maybe more irritable than usual? I want to get a clear picture of what you\u2019re dealing with.\nPatient: I get irritable more than anything else when my mood\u2019s off. Not really sad or empty. Just annoyed at how things are, but I keep going.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014irritability can be tougher on the people around us sometimes. How strong is that feeling, and how often does it pop up? Are there certain things or situations that set it off more than others? And how do you usually handle it when you get that way?\nPatient: Irritable pretty often. Mostly when things or people mess up what I\u2019m trying to do. I just keep busy or shut down. Doesn\u2019t get any deeper than that.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014frustration when things don\u2019t go as planned can really wear on you. Keeping busy or stepping back are pretty natural ways to handle that kind of irritation. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to manage, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\nPatient: Yeah, frustration\u2019s just part of the daily mess. I deal with it by staying busy or tuning out. Can\u2019t let every snag grind me down.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014you\u2019re doing your best to keep things from grinding you down. Even with staying busy, have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately? Has that been a steady problem for you?\nPatient: Energy\u2019s generally alright. No steady issues with being tired or low.\nDoctor: Good to hear your energy\u2019s holding up. How about your interest in things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or less pleasure in hobbies or activities lately?\nPatient: Somewhat less interested in things I used to do. Doesn\u2019t bother me much.\nDoctor: Can you give me an example of something you used to enjoy that you\u2019re a bit less interested in now? Does this change affect how motivated you feel day to day, or do you just take things as they come? I\u2019m curious even if it\u2019s not a big bother for you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t fish as much as before, but I still get things done. Don\u2019t let it slow me down too much. Take things day by day.\nDoctor: Taking it day by day sounds like a sensible way to handle things. How often do you notice this drop in interest or motivation? Are there any other activities besides fishing where you feel the same?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. Motivation dips sometimes, but I still keep on. Doesn\u2019t get in the way.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that these dips don\u2019t get in the way too much. How about concentration\u2014are you finding it harder to focus, make decisions, or feeling mentally foggy at times?\nPatient: No, concentration\u2019s fine. Decisions aren\u2019t a problem either.\nDoctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more, less, or any noticeable weight gain or loss?\nPatient: My appetite\u2019s changed a bit, eating less sometimes. No big weight changes or anything.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself eating less? Do you notice any particular reasons for it, like stress or just not feeling hungry? And does this change in appetite seem to affect your mood or energy at all?\nPatient: Sometimes I eat less, no particular reason mostly. Doesn\u2019t really affect how I feel or my energy.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re handling these small changes pretty well, which isn\u2019t always easy. Moving to a new place can shake things up in ways that aren\u2019t always obvious. How have you been finding the overall adjustment to this new environment?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a rough adjustment, the new place doesn\u2019t feel settled yet. Figuring out the routines is a challenge. But I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: It makes sense that it feels unsettled right now\u2014that kind of change is hard at any age. I appreciate that you\u2019re managing through it. What part of the adjustment feels toughest, and how are you getting through those moments day to day?\nPatient: The routines and the unfamiliar place make it tough. I just keep busy and push through. No point dwelling on it.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a tough spot to be in, but it takes real grit to keep pushing through like you do. On those tougher days, what helps you stay going?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat\u2019s a tough spot to be in, but it takes real grit to keep pushing through like you do.

Just the usual stuff with this new place.\nDoctor: I hear you on that restlessness\u2014feeling on edge can really wear you down. How often do you notice it during the day? Does it ever interfere with your sleep or daily activities? Also, when you say \"the usual stuff\" with the new place, what sort of challenges are you dealing with?\nPatient: The restlessness is pretty frequent, shows up most days. Sometimes it keeps me up a bit at night, but I manage. As for the new place, just figuring out the routines and not being in my own home anymore\u2014that\u2019s been the main issue. Keeps things unsettled.\nDoctor: Sleeping better can make a big difference. How\u2019s your sleep overall? Are you having trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up feeling tired instead of rested? Just want to understand how it's affecting you without any pressure.\nPatient: Sleep gets interrupted now and then, mostly \u2019cause I\u2019m restless. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle, doesn\u2019t happen every night. I get by fine.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019re managing, but those interruptions can still take a toll. How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it? Feel free to be upfront\u2014no pressure here.\nPatient: Yeah, the restlessness and some broken sleep leave me a bit tired now and then. My mood\u2019s off sometimes, but I keep things moving. Don\u2019t have much trouble getting through daily tasks.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling off now and then. When your mood\u2019s down, do you find yourself feeling sad, empty, or maybe more irritable than usual? I want to get a clear picture of what you\u2019re dealing with.\nPatient: I get irritable more than anything else when my mood\u2019s off. Not really sad or empty. Just annoyed at how things are, but I keep going.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014irritability can be tougher on the people around us sometimes. How strong is that feeling, and how often does it pop up? Are there certain things or situations that set it off more than others? And how do you usually handle it when you get that way?\nPatient: Irritable pretty often. Mostly when things or people mess up what I\u2019m trying to do. I just keep busy or shut down. Doesn\u2019t get any deeper than that.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014frustration when things don\u2019t go as planned can really wear on you. Keeping busy or stepping back are pretty natural ways to handle that kind of irritation. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to manage, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\nPatient: Yeah, frustration\u2019s just part of the daily mess. I deal with it by staying busy or tuning out. Can\u2019t let every snag grind me down.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014you\u2019re doing your best to keep things from grinding you down. Even with staying busy, have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately? Has that been a steady problem for you?\nPatient: Energy\u2019s generally alright. No steady issues with being tired or low.\nDoctor: Good to hear your energy\u2019s holding up. How about your interest in things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or less pleasure in hobbies or activities lately?\nPatient: Somewhat less interested in things I used to do. Doesn\u2019t bother me much.\nDoctor: Can you give me an example of something you used to enjoy that you\u2019re a bit less interested in now? Does this change affect how motivated you feel day to day, or do you just take things as they come? I\u2019m curious even if it\u2019s not a big bother for you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t fish as much as before, but I still get things done. Don\u2019t let it slow me down too much. Take things day by day.\nDoctor: Taking it day by day sounds like a sensible way to handle things. How often do you notice this drop in interest or motivation? Are there any other activities besides fishing where you feel the same?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. Motivation dips sometimes, but I still keep on. Doesn\u2019t get in the way.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that these dips don\u2019t get in the way too much. How about concentration\u2014are you finding it harder to focus, make decisions, or feeling mentally foggy at times?\nPatient: No, concentration\u2019s fine. Decisions aren\u2019t a problem either.\nDoctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more, less, or any noticeable weight gain or loss?\nPatient: My appetite\u2019s changed a bit, eating less sometimes. No big weight changes or anything.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself eating less? Do you notice any particular reasons for it, like stress or just not feeling hungry? And does this change in appetite seem to affect your mood or energy at all?\nPatient: Sometimes I eat less, no particular reason mostly. Doesn\u2019t really affect how I feel or my energy.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re handling these small changes pretty well, which isn\u2019t always easy. Moving to a new place can shake things up in ways that aren\u2019t always obvious. How have you been finding the overall adjustment to this new environment?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a rough adjustment, the new place doesn\u2019t feel settled yet. Figuring out the routines is a challenge. But I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: It makes sense that it feels unsettled right now\u2014that kind of change is hard at any age. I appreciate that you\u2019re managing through it. What part of the adjustment feels toughest, and how are you getting through those moments day to day?\nPatient: The routines and the unfamiliar place make it tough. I just keep busy and push through. No point dwelling on it.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a tough spot to be in, but it takes real grit to keep pushing through like you do.

Doesn\u2019t bother me much.\nDoctor: Can you give me an example of something you used to enjoy that you\u2019re a bit less interested in now? Does this change affect how motivated you feel day to day, or do you just take things as they come? I\u2019m curious even if it\u2019s not a big bother for you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t fish as much as before, but I still get things done. Don\u2019t let it slow me down too much. Take things day by day.\nDoctor: Taking it day by day sounds like a sensible way to handle things. How often do you notice this drop in interest or motivation? Are there any other activities besides fishing where you feel the same?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. Motivation dips sometimes, but I still keep on.

Decisions aren\u2019t a problem either.\nDoctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more, less, or any noticeable weight gain or loss?\nPatient: My appetite\u2019s changed a bit, eating less sometimes. No big weight changes or anything.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself eating less? Do you notice any particular reasons for it, like stress or just not feeling hungry? And does this change in appetite seem to affect your mood or energy at all?\nPatient: Sometimes I eat less, no particular reason mostly. Doesn\u2019t really affect how I feel or my energy.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re handling these small changes pretty well, which isn\u2019t always easy. Moving to a new place can shake things up in ways that aren\u2019t always obvious. How have you been finding the overall adjustment to this new environment?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a rough adjustment, the new place doesn\u2019t feel settled yet. Figuring out the routines is a challenge. But I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: It makes sense that it feels unsettled right now\u2014that kind of change is hard at any age. I appreciate that you\u2019re managing through it. What part of the adjustment feels toughest, and how are you getting through those moments day to day?\nPatient: The routines and the unfamiliar place make it tough. I just keep busy and push through. No point dwelling on it.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a tough spot to be in, but it takes real grit to keep pushing through like you do. On those tougher days, what helps you stay going?\nPatient: I just keep busy and don\u2019t let myself think too much. Keeps things from spiraling.\nDoctor: Keeping busy sounds like a solid way to keep your head clear. Have you noticed any moments where you feel down on yourself, worthless, or carrying blame for things\u2014maybe more than seems fair?

Just the usual stuff with this new place.\nDoctor: I hear you on that restlessness\u2014feeling on edge can really wear you down. How often do you notice it during the day? Does it ever interfere with your sleep or daily activities? Also, when you say \"the usual stuff\" with the new place, what sort of challenges are you dealing with?\nPatient: The restlessness is pretty frequent, shows up most days. Sometimes it keeps me up a bit at night, but I manage. As for the new place, just figuring out the routines and not being in my own home anymore\u2014that\u2019s been the main issue. Keeps things unsettled.\nDoctor: Sleeping better can make a big difference. How\u2019s your sleep overall? Are you having trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up feeling tired instead of rested? Just want to understand how it's affecting you without any pressure.\nPatient: Sleep gets interrupted now and then, mostly \u2019cause I\u2019m restless. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle, doesn\u2019t happen every night. I get by fine.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019re managing, but those interruptions can still take a toll. How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it? Feel free to be upfront\u2014no pressure here.\nPatient: Yeah, the restlessness and some broken sleep leave me a bit tired now and then. My mood\u2019s off sometimes, but I keep things moving. Don\u2019t have much trouble getting through daily tasks.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling off now and then. When your mood\u2019s down, do you find yourself feeling sad, empty, or maybe more irritable than usual? I want to get a clear picture of what you\u2019re dealing with.\nPatient: I get irritable more than anything else when my mood\u2019s off. Not really sad or empty. Just annoyed at how things are, but I keep going.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014irritability can be tougher on the people around us sometimes. How strong is that feeling, and how often does it pop up? Are there certain things or situations that set it off more than others? And how do you usually handle it when you get that way?\nPatient: Irritable pretty often. Mostly when things or people mess up what I\u2019m trying to do. I just keep busy or shut down. Doesn\u2019t get any deeper than that.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014frustration when things don\u2019t go as planned can really wear on you. Keeping busy or stepping back are pretty natural ways to handle that kind of irritation. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to manage, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\nPatient: Yeah, frustration\u2019s just part of the daily mess. I deal with it by staying busy or tuning out. Can\u2019t let every snag grind me down.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014you\u2019re doing your best to keep things from grinding you down. Even with staying busy, have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately? Has that been a steady problem for you?\nPatient: Energy\u2019s generally alright. No steady issues with being tired or low.\nDoctor: Good to hear your energy\u2019s holding up. How about your interest in things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or less pleasure in hobbies or activities lately?\nPatient: Somewhat less interested in things I used to do. Doesn\u2019t bother me much.\nDoctor: Can you give me an example of something you used to enjoy that you\u2019re a bit less interested in now? Does this change affect how motivated you feel day to day, or do you just take things as they come? I\u2019m curious even if it\u2019s not a big bother for you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t fish as much as before, but I still get things done. Don\u2019t let it slow me down too much. Take things day by day.\nDoctor: Taking it day by day sounds like a sensible way to handle things. How often do you notice this drop in interest or motivation? Are there any other activities besides fishing where you feel the same?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. Motivation dips sometimes, but I still keep on. Doesn\u2019t get in the way.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that these dips don\u2019t get in the way too much.

Moving to a new place can shake things up in ways that aren\u2019t always obvious. How have you been finding the overall adjustment to this new environment?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a rough adjustment, the new place doesn\u2019t feel settled yet.

Also, when you say \"the usual stuff\" with the new place, what sort of challenges are you dealing with?\nPatient: The restlessness is pretty frequent, shows up most days. Sometimes it keeps me up a bit at night, but I manage. As for the new place, just figuring out the routines and not being in my own home anymore\u2014that\u2019s been the main issue. Keeps things unsettled.\nDoctor: Sleeping better can make a big difference. How\u2019s your sleep overall? Are you having trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up feeling tired instead of rested? Just want to understand how it's affecting you without any pressure.\nPatient: Sleep gets interrupted now and then, mostly \u2019cause I\u2019m restless. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle, doesn\u2019t happen every night. I get by fine.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019re managing, but those interruptions can still take a toll. How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it? Feel free to be upfront\u2014no pressure here.\nPatient: Yeah, the restlessness and some broken sleep leave me a bit tired now and then. My mood\u2019s off sometimes, but I keep things moving. Don\u2019t have much trouble getting through daily tasks.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling off now and then. When your mood\u2019s down, do you find yourself feeling sad, empty, or maybe more irritable than usual? I want to get a clear picture of what you\u2019re dealing with.\nPatient: I get irritable more than anything else when my mood\u2019s off. Not really sad or empty. Just annoyed at how things are, but I keep going.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014irritability can be tougher on the people around us sometimes. How strong is that feeling, and how often does it pop up? Are there certain things or situations that set it off more than others? And how do you usually handle it when you get that way?\nPatient: Irritable pretty often. Mostly when things or people mess up what I\u2019m trying to do. I just keep busy or shut down. Doesn\u2019t get any deeper than that.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014frustration when things don\u2019t go as planned can really wear on you. Keeping busy or stepping back are pretty natural ways to handle that kind of irritation. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to manage, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\nPatient: Yeah, frustration\u2019s just part of the daily mess. I deal with it by staying busy or tuning out. Can\u2019t let every snag grind me down.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014you\u2019re doing your best to keep things from grinding you down. Even with staying busy, have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately? Has that been a steady problem for you?\nPatient: Energy\u2019s generally alright. No steady issues with being tired or low.\nDoctor: Good to hear your energy\u2019s holding up. How about your interest in things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or less pleasure in hobbies or activities lately?\nPatient: Somewhat less interested in things I used to do. Doesn\u2019t bother me much.\nDoctor: Can you give me an example of something you used to enjoy that you\u2019re a bit less interested in now? Does this change affect how motivated you feel day to day, or do you just take things as they come? I\u2019m curious even if it\u2019s not a big bother for you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t fish as much as before, but I still get things done. Don\u2019t let it slow me down too much. Take things day by day.\nDoctor: Taking it day by day sounds like a sensible way to handle things. How often do you notice this drop in interest or motivation? Are there any other activities besides fishing where you feel the same?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. Motivation dips sometimes, but I still keep on. Doesn\u2019t get in the way.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that these dips don\u2019t get in the way too much. How about concentration\u2014are you finding it harder to focus, make decisions, or feeling mentally foggy at times?\nPatient: No, concentration\u2019s fine. Decisions aren\u2019t a problem either.\nDoctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more, less, or any noticeable weight gain or loss?\nPatient: My appetite\u2019s changed a bit, eating less sometimes. No big weight changes or anything.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself eating less? Do you notice any particular reasons for it, like stress or just not feeling hungry? And does this change in appetite seem to affect your mood or energy at all?\nPatient: Sometimes I eat less, no particular reason mostly. Doesn\u2019t really affect how I feel or my energy.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re handling these small changes pretty well, which isn\u2019t always easy. Moving to a new place can shake things up in ways that aren\u2019t always obvious. How have you been finding the overall adjustment to this new environment?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a rough adjustment, the new place doesn\u2019t feel settled yet. Figuring out the routines is a challenge. But I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: It makes sense that it feels unsettled right now\u2014that kind of change is hard at any age. I appreciate that you\u2019re managing through it. What part of the adjustment feels toughest, and how are you getting through those moments day to day?\nPatient: The routines and the unfamiliar place make it tough. I just keep busy and push through. No point dwelling on it.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a tough spot to be in, but it takes real grit to keep pushing through like you do. On those tougher days, what helps you stay going?\nPatient: I just keep busy and don\u2019t let myself think too much. Keeps things from spiraling.\nDoctor: Keeping busy sounds like a solid way to keep your head clear. Have you noticed any moments where you feel down on yourself, worthless, or carrying blame for things\u2014maybe more than seems fair? It\u2019s okay to be honest here.\nPatient: Sometimes I get blamed for stuff, but mostly it\u2019s not on me. I don\u2019t dwell on it much.\nDoctor: That sounds frustrating, especially when you\u2019re not really to blame. It\u2019s understandable you\u2019d want to tune it out to avoid getting bogged down. How does that blame affect you when it does happen?\nPatient: It\u2019s annoying, but I just tune it out.

Let's go over how you've been doing. What's been happening lately?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been restless at times, can\u2019t sit still much. It\u2019s been bothering me some, but nothing too serious. Just the usual stuff with this new place.\nDoctor: I hear you on that restlessness\u2014feeling on edge can really wear you down. How often do you notice it during the day? Does it ever interfere with your sleep or daily activities? Also, when you say \"the usual stuff\" with the new place, what sort of challenges are you dealing with?\nPatient: The restlessness is pretty frequent, shows up most days. Sometimes it keeps me up a bit at night, but I manage. As for the new place, just figuring out the routines and not being in my own home anymore\u2014that\u2019s been the main issue. Keeps things unsettled.\nDoctor: Sleeping better can make a big difference. How\u2019s your sleep overall? Are you having trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up feeling tired instead of rested? Just want to understand how it's affecting you without any pressure.\nPatient: Sleep gets interrupted now and then, mostly \u2019cause I\u2019m restless. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle, doesn\u2019t happen every night. I get by fine.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019re managing, but those interruptions can still take a toll. How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it? Feel free to be upfront\u2014no pressure here.\nPatient: Yeah, the restlessness and some broken sleep leave me a bit tired now and then. My mood\u2019s off sometimes, but I keep things moving. Don\u2019t have much trouble getting through daily tasks.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling off now and then. When your mood\u2019s down, do you find yourself feeling sad, empty, or maybe more irritable than usual? I want to get a clear picture of what you\u2019re dealing with.\nPatient: I get irritable more than anything else when my mood\u2019s off. Not really sad or empty. Just annoyed at how things are, but I keep going.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014irritability can be tougher on the people around us sometimes. How strong is that feeling, and how often does it pop up? Are there certain things or situations that set it off more than others? And how do you usually handle it when you get that way?\nPatient: Irritable pretty often. Mostly when things or people mess up what I\u2019m trying to do. I just keep busy or shut down. Doesn\u2019t get any deeper than that.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014frustration when things don\u2019t go as planned can really wear on you. Keeping busy or stepping back are pretty natural ways to handle that kind of irritation. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to manage, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\nPatient: Yeah, frustration\u2019s just part of the daily mess. I deal with it by staying busy or tuning out. Can\u2019t let every snag grind me down.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014you\u2019re doing your best to keep things from grinding you down. Even with staying busy, have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately? Has that been a steady problem for you?\nPatient: Energy\u2019s generally alright. No steady issues with being tired or low.\nDoctor: Good to hear your energy\u2019s holding up. How about your interest in things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or less pleasure in hobbies or activities lately?\nPatient: Somewhat less interested in things I used to do. Doesn\u2019t bother me much.\nDoctor: Can you give me an example of something you used to enjoy that you\u2019re a bit less interested in now? Does this change affect how motivated you feel day to day, or do you just take things as they come? I\u2019m curious even if it\u2019s not a big bother for you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t fish as much as before, but I still get things done. Don\u2019t let it slow me down too much. Take things day by day.\nDoctor: Taking it day by day sounds like a sensible way to handle things. How often do you notice this drop in interest or motivation? Are there any other activities besides fishing where you feel the same?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. Motivation dips sometimes, but I still keep on. Doesn\u2019t get in the way.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that these dips don\u2019t get in the way too much. How about concentration\u2014are you finding it harder to focus, make decisions, or feeling mentally foggy at times?\nPatient: No, concentration\u2019s fine. Decisions aren\u2019t a problem either.\nDoctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more, less, or any noticeable weight gain or loss?\nPatient: My appetite\u2019s changed a bit, eating less sometimes. No big weight changes or anything.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself eating less? Do you notice any particular reasons for it, like stress or just not feeling hungry? And does this change in appetite seem to affect your mood or energy at all?\nPatient: Sometimes I eat less, no particular reason mostly. Doesn\u2019t really affect how I feel or my energy.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re handling these small changes pretty well, which isn\u2019t always easy. Moving to a new place can shake things up in ways that aren\u2019t always obvious. How have you been finding the overall adjustment to this new environment?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a rough adjustment, the new place doesn\u2019t feel settled yet. Figuring out the routines is a challenge. But I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: It makes sense that it feels unsettled right now\u2014that kind of change is hard at any age. I appreciate that you\u2019re managing through it. What part of the adjustment feels toughest, and how are you getting through those moments day to day?\nPatient: The routines and the unfamiliar place make it tough. I just keep busy and push through. No point dwelling on it.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a tough spot to be in, but it takes real grit to keep pushing through like you do. On those tougher days, what helps you stay going?\nPatient: I just keep busy and don\u2019t let myself think too much. Keeps things from spiraling.\nDoctor: Keeping busy sounds like a solid way to keep your head clear. Have you noticed any moments where you feel down on yourself, worthless, or carrying blame for things\u2014maybe more than seems fair? It\u2019s okay to be honest here.\nPatient: Sometimes I get blamed for stuff, but mostly it\u2019s not on me. I don\u2019t dwell on it much.\nDoctor: That sounds frustrating, especially when you\u2019re not really to blame. It\u2019s understandable you\u2019d want to tune it out to avoid getting bogged down. How does that blame affect you when it does happen?\nPatient: It\u2019s annoying, but I just tune it out. Not my fault, so I don\u2019t let it get to me.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a strong way to handle something that could easily wear you down. It takes effort to not let unfair blame get under your skin. I\u2019m here if you ever want to talk more about how that feels or anything else on your mind.\nPatient: I mostly ignore it and don\u2019t let it break me down. I\u2019m alright.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nI mostly ignore it and don\u2019t let it break me down. I\u2019m alright.",

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

Let's go over how you've been doing. What's been happening lately?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been restless at times, can\u2019t sit still much. It\u2019s been bothering me some, but nothing too serious. Just the usual stuff with this new place.\nDoctor: I hear you on that restlessness\u2014feeling on edge can really wear you down. How often do you notice it during the day? Does it ever interfere with your sleep or daily activities? Also, when you say \"the usual stuff\" with the new place, what sort of challenges are you dealing with?\nPatient: The restlessness is pretty frequent, shows up most days. Sometimes it keeps me up a bit at night, but I manage. As for the new place, just figuring out the routines and not being in my own home anymore\u2014that\u2019s been the main issue. Keeps things unsettled.\nDoctor: Sleeping better can make a big difference. How\u2019s your sleep overall? Are you having trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up feeling tired instead of rested? Just want to understand how it's affecting you without any pressure.\nPatient: Sleep gets interrupted now and then, mostly \u2019cause I\u2019m restless. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle, doesn\u2019t happen every night. I get by fine.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019re managing, but those interruptions can still take a toll. How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it? Feel free to be upfront\u2014no pressure here.\nPatient: Yeah, the restlessness and some broken sleep leave me a bit tired now and then. My mood\u2019s off sometimes, but I keep things moving. Don\u2019t have much trouble getting through daily tasks.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling off now and then. When your mood\u2019s down, do you find yourself feeling sad, empty, or maybe more irritable than usual? I want to get a clear picture of what you\u2019re dealing with.\nPatient: I get irritable more than anything else when my mood\u2019s off. Not really sad or empty. Just annoyed at how things are, but I keep going.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014irritability can be tougher on the people around us sometimes. How strong is that feeling, and how often does it pop up? Are there certain things or situations that set it off more than others? And how do you usually handle it when you get that way?\nPatient: Irritable pretty often. Mostly when things or people mess up what I\u2019m trying to do. I just keep busy or shut down. Doesn\u2019t get any deeper than that.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014frustration when things don\u2019t go as planned can really wear on you. Keeping busy or stepping back are pretty natural ways to handle that kind of irritation. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to manage, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\nPatient: Yeah, frustration\u2019s just part of the daily mess. I deal with it by staying busy or tuning out. Can\u2019t let every snag grind me down.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014you\u2019re doing your best to keep things from grinding you down. Even with staying busy, have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately? Has that been a steady problem for you?\nPatient: Energy\u2019s generally alright. No steady issues with being tired or low.\nDoctor: Good to hear your energy\u2019s holding up. How about your interest in things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or less pleasure in hobbies or activities lately?\nPatient: Somewhat less interested in things I used to do. Doesn\u2019t bother me much.\nDoctor: Can you give me an example of something you used to enjoy that you\u2019re a bit less interested in now? Does this change affect how motivated you feel day to day, or do you just take things as they come? I\u2019m curious even if it\u2019s not a big bother for you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t fish as much as before, but I still get things done. Don\u2019t let it slow me down too much. Take things day by day.\nDoctor: Taking it day by day sounds like a sensible way to handle things. How often do you notice this drop in interest or motivation? Are there any other activities besides fishing where you feel the same?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. Motivation dips sometimes, but I still keep on. Doesn\u2019t get in the way.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that these dips don\u2019t get in the way too much. How about concentration\u2014are you finding it harder to focus, make decisions, or feeling mentally foggy at times?\nPatient: No, concentration\u2019s fine. Decisions aren\u2019t a problem either.\nDoctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more, less, or any noticeable weight gain or loss?\nPatient: My appetite\u2019s changed a bit, eating less sometimes. No big weight changes or anything.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself eating less? Do you notice any particular reasons for it, like stress or just not feeling hungry? And does this change in appetite seem to affect your mood or energy at all?\nPatient: Sometimes I eat less, no particular reason mostly. Doesn\u2019t really affect how I feel or my energy.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re handling these small changes pretty well, which isn\u2019t always easy. Moving to a new place can shake things up in ways that aren\u2019t always obvious. How have you been finding the overall adjustment to this new environment?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a rough adjustment, the new place doesn\u2019t feel settled yet. Figuring out the routines is a challenge. But I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: It makes sense that it feels unsettled right now\u2014that kind of change is hard at any age. I appreciate that you\u2019re managing through it. What part of the adjustment feels toughest, and how are you getting through those moments day to day?\nPatient: The routines and the unfamiliar place make it tough. I just keep busy and push through. No point dwelling on it.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a tough spot to be in, but it takes real grit to keep pushing through like you do. On those tougher days, what helps you stay going?\nPatient: I just keep busy and don\u2019t let myself think too much. Keeps things from spiraling.\nDoctor: Keeping busy sounds like a solid way to keep your head clear. Have you noticed any moments where you feel down on yourself, worthless, or carrying blame for things\u2014maybe more than seems fair? It\u2019s okay to be honest here.\nPatient: Sometimes I get blamed for stuff, but mostly it\u2019s not on me. I don\u2019t dwell on it much.\nDoctor: That sounds frustrating, especially when you\u2019re not really to blame. It\u2019s understandable you\u2019d want to tune it out to avoid getting bogged down. How does that blame affect you when it does happen?\nPatient: It\u2019s annoying, but I just tune it out. Not my fault, so I don\u2019t let it get to me.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a strong way to handle something that could easily wear you down. It takes effort to not let unfair blame get under your skin. I\u2019m here if you ever want to talk more about how that feels or anything else on your mind.\nPatient: I mostly ignore it and don\u2019t let it break me down. I\u2019m alright.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re holding steady. It\u2019s a common topic to bring up\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide? It\u2019s important to check in on this to make sure you\u2019re safe.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nNo, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that.",

Take things day by day.\nDoctor: Taking it day by day sounds like a sensible way to handle things. How often do you notice this drop in interest or motivation? Are there any other activities besides fishing where you feel the same?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. Motivation dips sometimes, but I still keep on. Doesn\u2019t get in the way.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that these dips don\u2019t get in the way too much. How about concentration\u2014are you finding it harder to focus, make decisions, or feeling mentally foggy at times?\nPatient: No, concentration\u2019s fine. Decisions aren\u2019t a problem either.\nDoctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more, less, or any noticeable weight gain or loss?\nPatient: My appetite\u2019s changed a bit, eating less sometimes. No big weight changes or anything.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself eating less? Do you notice any particular reasons for it, like stress or just not feeling hungry? And does this change in appetite seem to affect your mood or energy at all?\nPatient: Sometimes I eat less, no particular reason mostly. Doesn\u2019t really affect how I feel or my energy.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re handling these small changes pretty well, which isn\u2019t always easy. Moving to a new place can shake things up in ways that aren\u2019t always obvious. How have you been finding the overall adjustment to this new environment?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a rough adjustment, the new place doesn\u2019t feel settled yet. Figuring out the routines is a challenge. But I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: It makes sense that it feels unsettled right now\u2014that kind of change is hard at any age. I appreciate that you\u2019re managing through it. What part of the adjustment feels toughest, and how are you getting through those moments day to day?\nPatient: The routines and the unfamiliar place make it tough. I just keep busy and push through. No point dwelling on it.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a tough spot to be in, but it takes real grit to keep pushing through like you do. On those tougher days, what helps you stay going?\nPatient: I just keep busy and don\u2019t let myself think too much. Keeps things from spiraling.\nDoctor: Keeping busy sounds like a solid way to keep your head clear. Have you noticed any moments where you feel down on yourself, worthless, or carrying blame for things\u2014maybe more than seems fair? It\u2019s okay to be honest here.\nPatient: Sometimes I get blamed for stuff, but mostly it\u2019s not on me. I don\u2019t dwell on it much.\nDoctor: That sounds frustrating, especially when you\u2019re not really to blame. It\u2019s understandable you\u2019d want to tune it out to avoid getting bogged down. How does that blame affect you when it does happen?\nPatient: It\u2019s annoying, but I just tune it out. Not my fault, so I don\u2019t let it get to me.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a strong way to handle something that could easily wear you down. It takes effort to not let unfair blame get under your skin. I\u2019m here if you ever want to talk more about how that feels or anything else on your mind.\nPatient: I mostly ignore it and don\u2019t let it break me down. I\u2019m alright.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re holding steady. It\u2019s a common topic to bring up\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide? It\u2019s important to check in on this to make sure you\u2019re safe.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s reassuring you haven\u2019t had those kinds of thoughts. You\u2019re clearly putting in a lot of effort to keep steady. On your tougher days, what helps you find a bit of calm or relief?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s reassuring you haven\u2019t had those kinds of thoughts.

Let's go over how you've been doing. What's been happening lately?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been restless at times, can\u2019t sit still much. It\u2019s been bothering me some, but nothing too serious. Just the usual stuff with this new place.\nDoctor: I hear you on that restlessness\u2014feeling on edge can really wear you down. How often do you notice it during the day? Does it ever interfere with your sleep or daily activities? Also, when you say \"the usual stuff\" with the new place, what sort of challenges are you dealing with?\nPatient: The restlessness is pretty frequent, shows up most days. Sometimes it keeps me up a bit at night, but I manage. As for the new place, just figuring out the routines and not being in my own home anymore\u2014that\u2019s been the main issue. Keeps things unsettled.\nDoctor: Sleeping better can make a big difference. How\u2019s your sleep overall? Are you having trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up feeling tired instead of rested? Just want to understand how it's affecting you without any pressure.\nPatient: Sleep gets interrupted now and then, mostly \u2019cause I\u2019m restless. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle, doesn\u2019t happen every night. I get by fine.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019re managing, but those interruptions can still take a toll. How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it? Feel free to be upfront\u2014no pressure here.\nPatient: Yeah, the restlessness and some broken sleep leave me a bit tired now and then. My mood\u2019s off sometimes, but I keep things moving. Don\u2019t have much trouble getting through daily tasks.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling off now and then. When your mood\u2019s down, do you find yourself feeling sad, empty, or maybe more irritable than usual? I want to get a clear picture of what you\u2019re dealing with.\nPatient: I get irritable more than anything else when my mood\u2019s off. Not really sad or empty. Just annoyed at how things are, but I keep going.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014irritability can be tougher on the people around us sometimes. How strong is that feeling, and how often does it pop up? Are there certain things or situations that set it off more than others? And how do you usually handle it when you get that way?\nPatient: Irritable pretty often. Mostly when things or people mess up what I\u2019m trying to do. I just keep busy or shut down. Doesn\u2019t get any deeper than that.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014frustration when things don\u2019t go as planned can really wear on you. Keeping busy or stepping back are pretty natural ways to handle that kind of irritation. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to manage, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\nPatient: Yeah, frustration\u2019s just part of the daily mess. I deal with it by staying busy or tuning out. Can\u2019t let every snag grind me down.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014you\u2019re doing your best to keep things from grinding you down. Even with staying busy, have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately? Has that been a steady problem for you?\nPatient: Energy\u2019s generally alright. No steady issues with being tired or low.\nDoctor: Good to hear your energy\u2019s holding up. How about your interest in things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or less pleasure in hobbies or activities lately?\nPatient: Somewhat less interested in things I used to do. Doesn\u2019t bother me much.\nDoctor: Can you give me an example of something you used to enjoy that you\u2019re a bit less interested in now? Does this change affect how motivated you feel day to day, or do you just take things as they come? I\u2019m curious even if it\u2019s not a big bother for you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t fish as much as before, but I still get things done. Don\u2019t let it slow me down too much.

Let's go over how you've been doing. What's been happening lately?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been restless at times, can\u2019t sit still much. It\u2019s been bothering me some, but nothing too serious. Just the usual stuff with this new place.\nDoctor: I hear you on that restlessness\u2014feeling on edge can really wear you down. How often do you notice it during the day? Does it ever interfere with your sleep or daily activities? Also, when you say \"the usual stuff\" with the new place, what sort of challenges are you dealing with?\nPatient: The restlessness is pretty frequent, shows up most days. Sometimes it keeps me up a bit at night, but I manage. As for the new place, just figuring out the routines and not being in my own home anymore\u2014that\u2019s been the main issue. Keeps things unsettled.\nDoctor: Sleeping better can make a big difference. How\u2019s your sleep overall? Are you having trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up feeling tired instead of rested? Just want to understand how it's affecting you without any pressure.\nPatient: Sleep gets interrupted now and then, mostly \u2019cause I\u2019m restless. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle, doesn\u2019t happen every night. I get by fine.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019re managing, but those interruptions can still take a toll. How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it? Feel free to be upfront\u2014no pressure here.\nPatient: Yeah, the restlessness and some broken sleep leave me a bit tired now and then. My mood\u2019s off sometimes, but I keep things moving. Don\u2019t have much trouble getting through daily tasks.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling off now and then. When your mood\u2019s down, do you find yourself feeling sad, empty, or maybe more irritable than usual? I want to get a clear picture of what you\u2019re dealing with.\nPatient: I get irritable more than anything else when my mood\u2019s off. Not really sad or empty. Just annoyed at how things are, but I keep going.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014irritability can be tougher on the people around us sometimes. How strong is that feeling, and how often does it pop up? Are there certain things or situations that set it off more than others? And how do you usually handle it when you get that way?\nPatient: Irritable pretty often. Mostly when things or people mess up what I\u2019m trying to do. I just keep busy or shut down. Doesn\u2019t get any deeper than that.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014frustration when things don\u2019t go as planned can really wear on you. Keeping busy or stepping back are pretty natural ways to handle that kind of irritation. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to manage, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\nPatient: Yeah, frustration\u2019s just part of the daily mess. I deal with it by staying busy or tuning out. Can\u2019t let every snag grind me down.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014you\u2019re doing your best to keep things from grinding you down. Even with staying busy, have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately? Has that been a steady problem for you?\nPatient: Energy\u2019s generally alright. No steady issues with being tired or low.\nDoctor: Good to hear your energy\u2019s holding up. How about your interest in things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or less pleasure in hobbies or activities lately?\nPatient: Somewhat less interested in things I used to do. Doesn\u2019t bother me much.\nDoctor: Can you give me an example of something you used to enjoy that you\u2019re a bit less interested in now? Does this change affect how motivated you feel day to day, or do you just take things as they come? I\u2019m curious even if it\u2019s not a big bother for you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t fish as much as before, but I still get things done. Don\u2019t let it slow me down too much. Take things day by day.\nDoctor: Taking it day by day sounds like a sensible way to handle things. How often do you notice this drop in interest or motivation? Are there any other activities besides fishing where you feel the same?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. Motivation dips sometimes, but I still keep on. Doesn\u2019t get in the way.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that these dips don\u2019t get in the way too much. How about concentration\u2014are you finding it harder to focus, make decisions, or feeling mentally foggy at times?\nPatient: No, concentration\u2019s fine. Decisions aren\u2019t a problem either.\nDoctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more, less, or any noticeable weight gain or loss?\nPatient: My appetite\u2019s changed a bit, eating less sometimes. No big weight changes or anything.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself eating less? Do you notice any particular reasons for it, like stress or just not feeling hungry? And does this change in appetite seem to affect your mood or energy at all?\nPatient: Sometimes I eat less, no particular reason mostly. Doesn\u2019t really affect how I feel or my energy.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re handling these small changes pretty well, which isn\u2019t always easy. Moving to a new place can shake things up in ways that aren\u2019t always obvious. How have you been finding the overall adjustment to this new environment?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a rough adjustment, the new place doesn\u2019t feel settled yet. Figuring out the routines is a challenge. But I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: It makes sense that it feels unsettled right now\u2014that kind of change is hard at any age. I appreciate that you\u2019re managing through it. What part of the adjustment feels toughest, and how are you getting through those moments day to day?\nPatient: The routines and the unfamiliar place make it tough. I just keep busy and push through. No point dwelling on it.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a tough spot to be in, but it takes real grit to keep pushing through like you do. On those tougher days, what helps you stay going?\nPatient: I just keep busy and don\u2019t let myself think too much. Keeps things from spiraling.\nDoctor: Keeping busy sounds like a solid way to keep your head clear. Have you noticed any moments where you feel down on yourself, worthless, or carrying blame for things\u2014maybe more than seems fair? It\u2019s okay to be honest here.\nPatient: Sometimes I get blamed for stuff, but mostly it\u2019s not on me. I don\u2019t dwell on it much.\nDoctor: That sounds frustrating, especially when you\u2019re not really to blame. It\u2019s understandable you\u2019d want to tune it out to avoid getting bogged down. How does that blame affect you when it does happen?\nPatient: It\u2019s annoying, but I just tune it out. Not my fault, so I don\u2019t let it get to me.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a strong way to handle something that could easily wear you down. It takes effort to not let unfair blame get under your skin. I\u2019m here if you ever want to talk more about how that feels or anything else on your mind.\nPatient: I mostly ignore it and don\u2019t let it break me down. I\u2019m alright.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re holding steady. It\u2019s a common topic to bring up\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide? It\u2019s important to check in on this to make sure you\u2019re safe.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s reassuring you haven\u2019t had those kinds of thoughts. You\u2019re clearly putting in a lot of effort to keep steady. On your tougher days, what helps you find a bit of calm or relief?\nPatient: Keeping busy is what helps. Just focus on what needs doing.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling restless and that staying busy helps. Can you tell me more about what that restlessness feels like physically? Are there times you find yourself fidgeting, unable to sit still, or maybe even feeling slowed down in your movements? I want to understand how these show up for you day to day.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nYou mentioned feeling restless and that staying busy helps.

Let's go over how you've been doing. What's been happening lately?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been restless at times, can\u2019t sit still much. It\u2019s been bothering me some, but nothing too serious. Just the usual stuff with this new place.\nDoctor: I hear you on that restlessness\u2014feeling on edge can really wear you down. How often do you notice it during the day? Does it ever interfere with your sleep or daily activities? Also, when you say \"the usual stuff\" with the new place, what sort of challenges are you dealing with?\nPatient: The restlessness is pretty frequent, shows up most days. Sometimes it keeps me up a bit at night, but I manage. As for the new place, just figuring out the routines and not being in my own home anymore\u2014that\u2019s been the main issue. Keeps things unsettled.\nDoctor: Sleeping better can make a big difference. How\u2019s your sleep overall? Are you having trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up feeling tired instead of rested? Just want to understand how it's affecting you without any pressure.\nPatient: Sleep gets interrupted now and then, mostly \u2019cause I\u2019m restless. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle, doesn\u2019t happen every night. I get by fine.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019re managing, but those interruptions can still take a toll. How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it? Feel free to be upfront\u2014no pressure here.\nPatient: Yeah, the restlessness and some broken sleep leave me a bit tired now and then. My mood\u2019s off sometimes, but I keep things moving. Don\u2019t have much trouble getting through daily tasks.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling off now and then. When your mood\u2019s down, do you find yourself feeling sad, empty, or maybe more irritable than usual? I want to get a clear picture of what you\u2019re dealing with.\nPatient: I get irritable more than anything else when my mood\u2019s off. Not really sad or empty. Just annoyed at how things are, but I keep going.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014irritability can be tougher on the people around us sometimes. How strong is that feeling, and how often does it pop up? Are there certain things or situations that set it off more than others? And how do you usually handle it when you get that way?\nPatient: Irritable pretty often. Mostly when things or people mess up what I\u2019m trying to do. I just keep busy or shut down. Doesn\u2019t get any deeper than that.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014frustration when things don\u2019t go as planned can really wear on you. Keeping busy or stepping back are pretty natural ways to handle that kind of irritation. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to manage, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\nPatient: Yeah, frustration\u2019s just part of the daily mess. I deal with it by staying busy or tuning out. Can\u2019t let every snag grind me down.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014you\u2019re doing your best to keep things from grinding you down. Even with staying busy, have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately? Has that been a steady problem for you?\nPatient: Energy\u2019s generally alright. No steady issues with being tired or low.\nDoctor: Good to hear your energy\u2019s holding up. How about your interest in things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or less pleasure in hobbies or activities lately?\nPatient: Somewhat less interested in things I used to do. Doesn\u2019t bother me much.\nDoctor: Can you give me an example of something you used to enjoy that you\u2019re a bit less interested in now? Does this change affect how motivated you feel day to day, or do you just take things as they come? I\u2019m curious even if it\u2019s not a big bother for you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t fish as much as before, but I still get things done. Don\u2019t let it slow me down too much. Take things day by day.\nDoctor: Taking it day by day sounds like a sensible way to handle things. How often do you notice this drop in interest or motivation? Are there any other activities besides fishing where you feel the same?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. Motivation dips sometimes, but I still keep on. Doesn\u2019t get in the way.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that these dips don\u2019t get in the way too much. How about concentration\u2014are you finding it harder to focus, make decisions, or feeling mentally foggy at times?\nPatient: No, concentration\u2019s fine. Decisions aren\u2019t a problem either.\nDoctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more, less, or any noticeable weight gain or loss?\nPatient: My appetite\u2019s changed a bit, eating less sometimes. No big weight changes or anything.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself eating less? Do you notice any particular reasons for it, like stress or just not feeling hungry? And does this change in appetite seem to affect your mood or energy at all?\nPatient: Sometimes I eat less, no particular reason mostly. Doesn\u2019t really affect how I feel or my energy.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re handling these small changes pretty well, which isn\u2019t always easy. Moving to a new place can shake things up in ways that aren\u2019t always obvious. How have you been finding the overall adjustment to this new environment?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a rough adjustment, the new place doesn\u2019t feel settled yet. Figuring out the routines is a challenge. But I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: It makes sense that it feels unsettled right now\u2014that kind of change is hard at any age. I appreciate that you\u2019re managing through it. What part of the adjustment feels toughest, and how are you getting through those moments day to day?\nPatient: The routines and the unfamiliar place make it tough. I just keep busy and push through. No point dwelling on it.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a tough spot to be in, but it takes real grit to keep pushing through like you do. On those tougher days, what helps you stay going?\nPatient: I just keep busy and don\u2019t let myself think too much. Keeps things from spiraling.\nDoctor: Keeping busy sounds like a solid way to keep your head clear. Have you noticed any moments where you feel down on yourself, worthless, or carrying blame for things\u2014maybe more than seems fair? It\u2019s okay to be honest here.\nPatient: Sometimes I get blamed for stuff, but mostly it\u2019s not on me. I don\u2019t dwell on it much.\nDoctor: That sounds frustrating, especially when you\u2019re not really to blame. It\u2019s understandable you\u2019d want to tune it out to avoid getting bogged down. How does that blame affect you when it does happen?\nPatient: It\u2019s annoying, but I just tune it out. Not my fault, so I don\u2019t let it get to me.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a strong way to handle something that could easily wear you down. It takes effort to not let unfair blame get under your skin. I\u2019m here if you ever want to talk more about how that feels or anything else on your mind.\nPatient: I mostly ignore it and don\u2019t let it break me down. I\u2019m alright.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re holding steady. It\u2019s a common topic to bring up\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide?

Don\u2019t have much trouble getting through daily tasks.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling off now and then. When your mood\u2019s down, do you find yourself feeling sad, empty, or maybe more irritable than usual? I want to get a clear picture of what you\u2019re dealing with.\nPatient: I get irritable more than anything else when my mood\u2019s off. Not really sad or empty. Just annoyed at how things are, but I keep going.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014irritability can be tougher on the people around us sometimes. How strong is that feeling, and how often does it pop up? Are there certain things or situations that set it off more than others? And how do you usually handle it when you get that way?\nPatient: Irritable pretty often. Mostly when things or people mess up what I\u2019m trying to do. I just keep busy or shut down. Doesn\u2019t get any deeper than that.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014frustration when things don\u2019t go as planned can really wear on you. Keeping busy or stepping back are pretty natural ways to handle that kind of irritation. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to manage, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\nPatient: Yeah, frustration\u2019s just part of the daily mess. I deal with it by staying busy or tuning out. Can\u2019t let every snag grind me down.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014you\u2019re doing your best to keep things from grinding you down. Even with staying busy, have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately? Has that been a steady problem for you?\nPatient: Energy\u2019s generally alright. No steady issues with being tired or low.\nDoctor: Good to hear your energy\u2019s holding up. How about your interest in things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or less pleasure in hobbies or activities lately?\nPatient: Somewhat less interested in things I used to do. Doesn\u2019t bother me much.\nDoctor: Can you give me an example of something you used to enjoy that you\u2019re a bit less interested in now? Does this change affect how motivated you feel day to day, or do you just take things as they come? I\u2019m curious even if it\u2019s not a big bother for you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t fish as much as before, but I still get things done. Don\u2019t let it slow me down too much. Take things day by day.\nDoctor: Taking it day by day sounds like a sensible way to handle things. How often do you notice this drop in interest or motivation? Are there any other activities besides fishing where you feel the same?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. Motivation dips sometimes, but I still keep on. Doesn\u2019t get in the way.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that these dips don\u2019t get in the way too much. How about concentration\u2014are you finding it harder to focus, make decisions, or feeling mentally foggy at times?\nPatient: No, concentration\u2019s fine. Decisions aren\u2019t a problem either.\nDoctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more, less, or any noticeable weight gain or loss?\nPatient: My appetite\u2019s changed a bit, eating less sometimes. No big weight changes or anything.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself eating less? Do you notice any particular reasons for it, like stress or just not feeling hungry? And does this change in appetite seem to affect your mood or energy at all?\nPatient: Sometimes I eat less, no particular reason mostly. Doesn\u2019t really affect how I feel or my energy.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re handling these small changes pretty well, which isn\u2019t always easy. Moving to a new place can shake things up in ways that aren\u2019t always obvious. How have you been finding the overall adjustment to this new environment?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a rough adjustment, the new place doesn\u2019t feel settled yet. Figuring out the routines is a challenge. But I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: It makes sense that it feels unsettled right now\u2014that kind of change is hard at any age. I appreciate that you\u2019re managing through it. What part of the adjustment feels toughest, and how are you getting through those moments day to day?\nPatient: The routines and the unfamiliar place make it tough. I just keep busy and push through. No point dwelling on it.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a tough spot to be in, but it takes real grit to keep pushing through like you do. On those tougher days, what helps you stay going?\nPatient: I just keep busy and don\u2019t let myself think too much. Keeps things from spiraling.\nDoctor: Keeping busy sounds like a solid way to keep your head clear. Have you noticed any moments where you feel down on yourself, worthless, or carrying blame for things\u2014maybe more than seems fair? It\u2019s okay to be honest here.\nPatient: Sometimes I get blamed for stuff, but mostly it\u2019s not on me. I don\u2019t dwell on it much.\nDoctor: That sounds frustrating, especially when you\u2019re not really to blame. It\u2019s understandable you\u2019d want to tune it out to avoid getting bogged down. How does that blame affect you when it does happen?\nPatient: It\u2019s annoying, but I just tune it out. Not my fault, so I don\u2019t let it get to me.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a strong way to handle something that could easily wear you down. It takes effort to not let unfair blame get under your skin. I\u2019m here if you ever want to talk more about how that feels or anything else on your mind.\nPatient: I mostly ignore it and don\u2019t let it break me down. I\u2019m alright.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re holding steady. It\u2019s a common topic to bring up\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide? It\u2019s important to check in on this to make sure you\u2019re safe.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s reassuring you haven\u2019t had those kinds of thoughts. You\u2019re clearly putting in a lot of effort to keep steady. On your tougher days, what helps you find a bit of calm or relief?\nPatient: Keeping busy is what helps. Just focus on what needs doing.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling restless and that staying busy helps. Can you tell me more about what that restlessness feels like physically? Are there times you find yourself fidgeting, unable to sit still, or maybe even feeling slowed down in your movements? I want to understand how these show up for you day to day.\nPatient: I\u2019m fidgeting a lot, can\u2019t sit still for long. Need to keep moving, or I get uncomfortable. No slowing down, just restless.\nDoctor: That constant restlessness sounds really uncomfortable, but you\u2019re managing to keep going despite it\u2014that takes real strength. Adjusting to a new environment like this is tough, and I\u2019m here to support you as you navigate it.\nPatient: It\u2019s uncomfortable, but I handle it on my own.

Just the usual stuff with this new place.\nDoctor: I hear you on that restlessness\u2014feeling on edge can really wear you down. How often do you notice it during the day? Does it ever interfere with your sleep or daily activities? Also, when you say \"the usual stuff\" with the new place, what sort of challenges are you dealing with?\nPatient: The restlessness is pretty frequent, shows up most days. Sometimes it keeps me up a bit at night, but I manage. As for the new place, just figuring out the routines and not being in my own home anymore\u2014that\u2019s been the main issue.

How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it?

Let's go over how you've been doing. What's been happening lately?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been restless at times, can\u2019t sit still much. It\u2019s been bothering me some, but nothing too serious. Just the usual stuff with this new place.\nDoctor: I hear you on that restlessness\u2014feeling on edge can really wear you down. How often do you notice it during the day? Does it ever interfere with your sleep or daily activities? Also, when you say \"the usual stuff\" with the new place, what sort of challenges are you dealing with?\nPatient: The restlessness is pretty frequent, shows up most days. Sometimes it keeps me up a bit at night, but I manage. As for the new place, just figuring out the routines and not being in my own home anymore\u2014that\u2019s been the main issue. Keeps things unsettled.\nDoctor: Sleeping better can make a big difference. How\u2019s your sleep overall? Are you having trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up feeling tired instead of rested? Just want to understand how it's affecting you without any pressure.\nPatient: Sleep gets interrupted now and then, mostly \u2019cause I\u2019m restless. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle, doesn\u2019t happen every night. I get by fine.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good you\u2019re managing, but those interruptions can still take a toll. How do these sleep and restlessness issues affect your energy or mood during the day? Any challenges with daily tasks because of it? Feel free to be upfront\u2014no pressure here.\nPatient: Yeah, the restlessness and some broken sleep leave me a bit tired now and then. My mood\u2019s off sometimes, but I keep things moving. Don\u2019t have much trouble getting through daily tasks.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling off now and then. When your mood\u2019s down, do you find yourself feeling sad, empty, or maybe more irritable than usual? I want to get a clear picture of what you\u2019re dealing with.\nPatient: I get irritable more than anything else when my mood\u2019s off. Not really sad or empty. Just annoyed at how things are, but I keep going.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014irritability can be tougher on the people around us sometimes. How strong is that feeling, and how often does it pop up? Are there certain things or situations that set it off more than others? And how do you usually handle it when you get that way?\nPatient: Irritable pretty often. Mostly when things or people mess up what I\u2019m trying to do. I just keep busy or shut down. Doesn\u2019t get any deeper than that.\nDoctor: That makes sense\u2014frustration when things don\u2019t go as planned can really wear on you. Keeping busy or stepping back are pretty natural ways to handle that kind of irritation. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve found ways to manage, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\nPatient: Yeah, frustration\u2019s just part of the daily mess. I deal with it by staying busy or tuning out. Can\u2019t let every snag grind me down.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014you\u2019re doing your best to keep things from grinding you down. Even with staying busy, have you noticed yourself feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately? Has that been a steady problem for you?\nPatient: Energy\u2019s generally alright. No steady issues with being tired or low.\nDoctor: Good to hear your energy\u2019s holding up. How about your interest in things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or less pleasure in hobbies or activities lately?\nPatient: Somewhat less interested in things I used to do. Doesn\u2019t bother me much.\nDoctor: Can you give me an example of something you used to enjoy that you\u2019re a bit less interested in now? Does this change affect how motivated you feel day to day, or do you just take things as they come? I\u2019m curious even if it\u2019s not a big bother for you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t fish as much as before, but I still get things done. Don\u2019t let it slow me down too much. Take things day by day.\nDoctor: Taking it day by day sounds like a sensible way to handle things. How often do you notice this drop in interest or motivation? Are there any other activities besides fishing where you feel the same?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. Motivation dips sometimes, but I still keep on. Doesn\u2019t get in the way.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good that these dips don\u2019t get in the way too much. How about concentration\u2014are you finding it harder to focus, make decisions, or feeling mentally foggy at times?\nPatient: No, concentration\u2019s fine. Decisions aren\u2019t a problem either.\nDoctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more, less, or any noticeable weight gain or loss?\nPatient: My appetite\u2019s changed a bit, eating less sometimes. No big weight changes or anything.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself eating less? Do you notice any particular reasons for it, like stress or just not feeling hungry? And does this change in appetite seem to affect your mood or energy at all?\nPatient: Sometimes I eat less, no particular reason mostly. Doesn\u2019t really affect how I feel or my energy.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re handling these small changes pretty well, which isn\u2019t always easy. Moving to a new place can shake things up in ways that aren\u2019t always obvious. How have you been finding the overall adjustment to this new environment?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a rough adjustment, the new place doesn\u2019t feel settled yet. Figuring out the routines is a challenge. But I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: It makes sense that it feels unsettled right now\u2014that kind of change is hard at any age. I appreciate that you\u2019re managing through it. What part of the adjustment feels toughest, and how are you getting through those moments day to day?\nPatient: The routines and the unfamiliar place make it tough. I just keep busy and push through. No point dwelling on it.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a tough spot to be in, but it takes real grit to keep pushing through like you do. On those tougher days, what helps you stay going?\nPatient: I just keep busy and don\u2019t let myself think too much. Keeps things from spiraling.\nDoctor: Keeping busy sounds like a solid way to keep your head clear. Have you noticed any moments where you feel down on yourself, worthless, or carrying blame for things\u2014maybe more than seems fair? It\u2019s okay to be honest here.\nPatient: Sometimes I get blamed for stuff, but mostly it\u2019s not on me. I don\u2019t dwell on it much.\nDoctor: That sounds frustrating, especially when you\u2019re not really to blame. It\u2019s understandable you\u2019d want to tune it out to avoid getting bogged down. How does that blame affect you when it does happen?\nPatient: It\u2019s annoying, but I just tune it out. Not my fault, so I don\u2019t let it get to me.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a strong way to handle something that could easily wear you down. It takes effort to not let unfair blame get under your skin. I\u2019m here if you ever want to talk more about how that feels or anything else on your mind.\nPatient: I mostly ignore it and don\u2019t let it break me down. I\u2019m alright.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re holding steady. It\u2019s a common topic to bring up\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide? It\u2019s important to check in on this to make sure you\u2019re safe.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s reassuring you haven\u2019t had those kinds of thoughts. You\u2019re clearly putting in a lot of effort to keep steady. On your tougher days, what helps you find a bit of calm or relief?\nPatient: Keeping busy is what helps. Just focus on what needs doing.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling restless and that staying busy helps. Can you tell me more about what that restlessness feels like physically? Are there times you find yourself fidgeting, unable to sit still, or maybe even feeling slowed down in your movements? I want to understand how these show up for you day to day.\nPatient: I\u2019m fidgeting a lot, can\u2019t sit still for long. Need to keep moving, or I get uncomfortable. No slowing down, just restless.\nDoctor: That constant restlessness sounds really uncomfortable, but you\u2019re managing to keep going despite it\u2014that takes real strength. Adjusting to a new environment like this is tough, and I\u2019m here to support you as you navigate it.\nPatient: It\u2019s uncomfortable, but I handle it on my own. Keep my mind busy, that\u2019s what works.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve got a strong sense of perseverance, handling discomfort by keeping your mind busy and pushing forward. That\u2019s no small feat, especially with all the changes you\u2019re facing. Just know I\u2019m here to help whenever you need support moving through this.\nPatient: I manage on my own, don\u2019t need much help. Appreciate it though.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
