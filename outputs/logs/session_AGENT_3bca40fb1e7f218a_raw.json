We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I've been feeling down some of the time\u2014nothing constant, but enough to notice. Sleep has been a real challenge; I find myself restless, waking up often, and struggling to get comfortable. That restlessness also makes it harder to focus during the day, so concentrating on my work has been tougher than usual. Overall, it\u2019s been a bit draining, but I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: When you say you\u2019re waking up often, how many times a night would you say that is? And when you\u2019re awake at those times, what kinds of thoughts or feelings are running through your mind?\nPatient: I usually wake up two or three times a night. When I\u2019m awake, it\u2019s more about feeling restless and irritated\u2014nothing like deep or overwhelming thoughts, really. I think a lot of it comes from external stressors, like noise or things going on around me, rather than something internal I\u2019m turning over in my head. It just feels frustrating and keeps me from settling back down easily.\nDoctor: Have you been feeling unusually guilty about things or like you\u2019re not good enough lately?\nPatient: There are times I do feel guilty, but it\u2019s more about the circumstances I\u2019m stuck in rather than thinking I\u2019m not good enough.

That kind of pressure can wear down anyone\u2014what\u2019s been the hardest part about managing those outside demands right now?\nPatient: The hardest part is trying to juggle everything when the expectations don\u2019t match up with the reality I\u2019m facing. Between work, school, and family stuff, it feels like there\u2019s always more being added without any real consideration for how stretched I already am. It\u2019s frustrating and makes me pretty restless and on edge most of the time. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it feels like an unfair weight that\u2019s just not letting up.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling restless and on edge\u2014have you noticed yourself moving more than usual, like pacing or fidgeting? Or, on the flip side, feeling slowed down in your movements or thoughts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed myself moving more\u2014pacing around sometimes or fidgeting when I\u2019m stuck on something. It\u2019s more about trying to burn off some of that built-up tension from all the pressure and stress coming at me. It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m slowed down or stuck, just kind of restless from everything going on outside of me.\nDoctor: That restless energy sounds intense. How does this constant need to move or burn off tension affect your daily routine or your mood throughout the day?\nPatient: It definitely throws off my routine\u2014I find myself pacing or fidgeting more than I\u2019d like, just trying to keep up with the stress.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I've been feeling down some of the time\u2014nothing constant, but enough to notice. Sleep has been a real challenge; I find myself restless, waking up often, and struggling to get comfortable. That restlessness also makes it harder to focus during the day, so concentrating on my work has been tougher than usual. Overall, it\u2019s been a bit draining, but I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: When you say you\u2019re waking up often, how many times a night would you say that is? And when you\u2019re awake at those times, what kinds of thoughts or feelings are running through your mind?\nPatient: I usually wake up two or three times a night. When I\u2019m awake, it\u2019s more about feeling restless and irritated\u2014nothing like deep or overwhelming thoughts, really. I think a lot of it comes from external stressors, like noise or things going on around me, rather than something internal I\u2019m turning over in my head. It just feels frustrating and keeps me from settling back down easily.\nDoctor: Have you been feeling unusually guilty about things or like you\u2019re not good enough lately?\nPatient: There are times I do feel guilty, but it\u2019s more about the circumstances I\u2019m stuck in rather than thinking I\u2019m not good enough. It\u2019s frustrating, honestly\u2014like I\u2019m being held to expectations that don\u2019t really consider what I\u2019m dealing with. So, the guilt feels tied to outside pressures, not because I\u2019m blaming myself directly.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough feeling like expectations are being piled on without recognizing what you\u2019re going through. That kind of pressure can wear down anyone\u2014what\u2019s been the hardest part about managing those outside demands right now?\nPatient: The hardest part is trying to juggle everything when the expectations don\u2019t match up with the reality I\u2019m facing. Between work, school, and family stuff, it feels like there\u2019s always more being added without any real consideration for how stretched I already am. It\u2019s frustrating and makes me pretty restless and on edge most of the time. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it feels like an unfair weight that\u2019s just not letting up.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling restless and on edge\u2014have you noticed yourself moving more than usual, like pacing or fidgeting? Or, on the flip side, feeling slowed down in your movements or thoughts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed myself moving more\u2014pacing around sometimes or fidgeting when I\u2019m stuck on something. It\u2019s more about trying to burn off some of that built-up tension from all the pressure and stress coming at me. It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m slowed down or stuck, just kind of restless from everything going on outside of me.\nDoctor: That restless energy sounds intense. How does this constant need to move or burn off tension affect your daily routine or your mood throughout the day?\nPatient: It definitely throws off my routine\u2014I find myself pacing or fidgeting more than I\u2019d like, just trying to keep up with the stress. That kind of constant agitation wears on me, making me feel more irritable and tired as the day goes on. But honestly, I see it as a reaction to all the outside pressure rather than something wrong with me personally. It\u2019s frustrating, but it\u2019s how I\u2019m managing to keep going despite everything.\nDoctor: Given the stress you\u2019ve been under, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?\nPatient: Not really. I haven\u2019t seen any significant changes in my appetite or weight. Most of what I\u2019m dealing with seems tied to the external stress and pressure around me rather than anything physical like that. So, eating and weight have stayed about the same despite everything else.\nDoctor: How have your energy levels been lately?

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I've been feeling down some of the time\u2014nothing constant, but enough to notice. Sleep has been a real challenge; I find myself restless, waking up often, and struggling to get comfortable. That restlessness also makes it harder to focus during the day, so concentrating on my work has been tougher than usual. Overall, it\u2019s been a bit draining, but I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: When you say you\u2019re waking up often, how many times a night would you say that is? And when you\u2019re awake at those times, what kinds of thoughts or feelings are running through your mind?\nPatient: I usually wake up two or three times a night. When I\u2019m awake, it\u2019s more about feeling restless and irritated\u2014nothing like deep or overwhelming thoughts, really. I think a lot of it comes from external stressors, like noise or things going on around me, rather than something internal I\u2019m turning over in my head. It just feels frustrating and keeps me from settling back down easily.\nDoctor: Have you been feeling unusually guilty about things or like you\u2019re not good enough lately?\nPatient: There are times I do feel guilty, but it\u2019s more about the circumstances I\u2019m stuck in rather than thinking I\u2019m not good enough. It\u2019s frustrating, honestly\u2014like I\u2019m being held to expectations that don\u2019t really consider what I\u2019m dealing with. So, the guilt feels tied to outside pressures, not because I\u2019m blaming myself directly.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough feeling like expectations are being piled on without recognizing what you\u2019re going through. That kind of pressure can wear down anyone\u2014what\u2019s been the hardest part about managing those outside demands right now?\nPatient: The hardest part is trying to juggle everything when the expectations don\u2019t match up with the reality I\u2019m facing. Between work, school, and family stuff, it feels like there\u2019s always more being added without any real consideration for how stretched I already am. It\u2019s frustrating and makes me pretty restless and on edge most of the time. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it feels like an unfair weight that\u2019s just not letting up.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling restless and on edge\u2014have you noticed yourself moving more than usual, like pacing or fidgeting? Or, on the flip side, feeling slowed down in your movements or thoughts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed myself moving more\u2014pacing around sometimes or fidgeting when I\u2019m stuck on something. It\u2019s more about trying to burn off some of that built-up tension from all the pressure and stress coming at me. It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m slowed down or stuck, just kind of restless from everything going on outside of me.\nDoctor: That restless energy sounds intense. How does this constant need to move or burn off tension affect your daily routine or your mood throughout the day?\nPatient: It definitely throws off my routine\u2014I find myself pacing or fidgeting more than I\u2019d like, just trying to keep up with the stress. That kind of constant agitation wears on me, making me feel more irritable and tired as the day goes on. But honestly, I see it as a reaction to all the outside pressure rather than something wrong with me personally. It\u2019s frustrating, but it\u2019s how I\u2019m managing to keep going despite everything.\nDoctor: Given the stress you\u2019ve been under, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?\nPatient: Not really. I haven\u2019t seen any significant changes in my appetite or weight. Most of what I\u2019m dealing with seems tied to the external stress and pressure around me rather than anything physical like that. So, eating and weight have stayed about the same despite everything else.\nDoctor: How have your energy levels been lately? Do you find yourself feeling unusually tired or drained, even after getting some rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired and drained most of the time, even when I do get some rest. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the exhaustion is coming from all the outside pressure and stress piling up, not because I\u2019m doing something wrong or failing personally. It\u2019s more like my body and mind are reacting to everything I\u2019m dealing with rather than me lacking effort.\nDoctor: That kind of exhaustion, especially when it feels tied to everything you\u2019re facing, can be really wearing. It makes total sense that your body and mind are reacting this way\u2014it\u2019s not about fault or failing.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I've been feeling down some of the time\u2014nothing constant, but enough to notice. Sleep has been a real challenge; I find myself restless, waking up often, and struggling to get comfortable. That restlessness also makes it harder to focus during the day, so concentrating on my work has been tougher than usual. Overall, it\u2019s been a bit draining, but I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: When you say you\u2019re waking up often, how many times a night would you say that is? And when you\u2019re awake at those times, what kinds of thoughts or feelings are running through your mind?\nPatient: I usually wake up two or three times a night. When I\u2019m awake, it\u2019s more about feeling restless and irritated\u2014nothing like deep or overwhelming thoughts, really. I think a lot of it comes from external stressors, like noise or things going on around me, rather than something internal I\u2019m turning over in my head. It just feels frustrating and keeps me from settling back down easily.\nDoctor: Have you been feeling unusually guilty about things or like you\u2019re not good enough lately?\nPatient: There are times I do feel guilty, but it\u2019s more about the circumstances I\u2019m stuck in rather than thinking I\u2019m not good enough. It\u2019s frustrating, honestly\u2014like I\u2019m being held to expectations that don\u2019t really consider what I\u2019m dealing with. So, the guilt feels tied to outside pressures, not because I\u2019m blaming myself directly.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough feeling like expectations are being piled on without recognizing what you\u2019re going through. That kind of pressure can wear down anyone\u2014what\u2019s been the hardest part about managing those outside demands right now?\nPatient: The hardest part is trying to juggle everything when the expectations don\u2019t match up with the reality I\u2019m facing. Between work, school, and family stuff, it feels like there\u2019s always more being added without any real consideration for how stretched I already am. It\u2019s frustrating and makes me pretty restless and on edge most of the time. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it feels like an unfair weight that\u2019s just not letting up.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling restless and on edge\u2014have you noticed yourself moving more than usual, like pacing or fidgeting? Or, on the flip side, feeling slowed down in your movements or thoughts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed myself moving more\u2014pacing around sometimes or fidgeting when I\u2019m stuck on something. It\u2019s more about trying to burn off some of that built-up tension from all the pressure and stress coming at me. It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m slowed down or stuck, just kind of restless from everything going on outside of me.\nDoctor: That restless energy sounds intense. How does this constant need to move or burn off tension affect your daily routine or your mood throughout the day?\nPatient: It definitely throws off my routine\u2014I find myself pacing or fidgeting more than I\u2019d like, just trying to keep up with the stress. That kind of constant agitation wears on me, making me feel more irritable and tired as the day goes on. But honestly, I see it as a reaction to all the outside pressure rather than something wrong with me personally. It\u2019s frustrating, but it\u2019s how I\u2019m managing to keep going despite everything.\nDoctor: Given the stress you\u2019ve been under, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?\nPatient: Not really. I haven\u2019t seen any significant changes in my appetite or weight. Most of what I\u2019m dealing with seems tied to the external stress and pressure around me rather than anything physical like that. So, eating and weight have stayed about the same despite everything else.\nDoctor: How have your energy levels been lately? Do you find yourself feeling unusually tired or drained, even after getting some rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired and drained most of the time, even when I do get some rest. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the exhaustion is coming from all the outside pressure and stress piling up, not because I\u2019m doing something wrong or failing personally. It\u2019s more like my body and mind are reacting to everything I\u2019m dealing with rather than me lacking effort.\nDoctor: That kind of exhaustion, especially when it feels tied to everything you\u2019re facing, can be really wearing. It makes total sense that your body and mind are reacting this way\u2014it\u2019s not about fault or failing. How has this ongoing stress been shaping your daily life or your ability to keep up with your usual responsibilities?\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely made keeping up with daily tasks a lot harder than usual. The stress just piles on, and combined with feeling restless and tired, it\u2019s tough to stay productive or focused. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the demands from outside are constantly pushing me, making it harder to get through even simple things. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it\u2019s wearing me down.\nDoctor: It sounds really challenging to keep up when even simple tasks feel overwhelming, and that kind of strain can chip away at your mood and motivation. What specific parts of your day or tasks have been hardest lately? How are those difficulties affecting how you\u2019re feeling overall?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nIt sounds really challenging to keep up when even simple tasks feel overwhelming, and that kind of strain can chip away at your mood and motivation.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I've been feeling down some of the time\u2014nothing constant, but enough to notice. Sleep has been a real challenge; I find myself restless, waking up often, and struggling to get comfortable. That restlessness also makes it harder to focus during the day, so concentrating on my work has been tougher than usual. Overall, it\u2019s been a bit draining, but I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: When you say you\u2019re waking up often, how many times a night would you say that is? And when you\u2019re awake at those times, what kinds of thoughts or feelings are running through your mind?\nPatient: I usually wake up two or three times a night. When I\u2019m awake, it\u2019s more about feeling restless and irritated\u2014nothing like deep or overwhelming thoughts, really. I think a lot of it comes from external stressors, like noise or things going on around me, rather than something internal I\u2019m turning over in my head. It just feels frustrating and keeps me from settling back down easily.\nDoctor: Have you been feeling unusually guilty about things or like you\u2019re not good enough lately?\nPatient: There are times I do feel guilty, but it\u2019s more about the circumstances I\u2019m stuck in rather than thinking I\u2019m not good enough. It\u2019s frustrating, honestly\u2014like I\u2019m being held to expectations that don\u2019t really consider what I\u2019m dealing with. So, the guilt feels tied to outside pressures, not because I\u2019m blaming myself directly.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough feeling like expectations are being piled on without recognizing what you\u2019re going through. That kind of pressure can wear down anyone\u2014what\u2019s been the hardest part about managing those outside demands right now?\nPatient: The hardest part is trying to juggle everything when the expectations don\u2019t match up with the reality I\u2019m facing. Between work, school, and family stuff, it feels like there\u2019s always more being added without any real consideration for how stretched I already am. It\u2019s frustrating and makes me pretty restless and on edge most of the time. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it feels like an unfair weight that\u2019s just not letting up.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling restless and on edge\u2014have you noticed yourself moving more than usual, like pacing or fidgeting? Or, on the flip side, feeling slowed down in your movements or thoughts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed myself moving more\u2014pacing around sometimes or fidgeting when I\u2019m stuck on something. It\u2019s more about trying to burn off some of that built-up tension from all the pressure and stress coming at me. It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m slowed down or stuck, just kind of restless from everything going on outside of me.\nDoctor: That restless energy sounds intense. How does this constant need to move or burn off tension affect your daily routine or your mood throughout the day?\nPatient: It definitely throws off my routine\u2014I find myself pacing or fidgeting more than I\u2019d like, just trying to keep up with the stress. That kind of constant agitation wears on me, making me feel more irritable and tired as the day goes on. But honestly, I see it as a reaction to all the outside pressure rather than something wrong with me personally. It\u2019s frustrating, but it\u2019s how I\u2019m managing to keep going despite everything.\nDoctor: Given the stress you\u2019ve been under, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?\nPatient: Not really. I haven\u2019t seen any significant changes in my appetite or weight. Most of what I\u2019m dealing with seems tied to the external stress and pressure around me rather than anything physical like that. So, eating and weight have stayed about the same despite everything else.\nDoctor: How have your energy levels been lately? Do you find yourself feeling unusually tired or drained, even after getting some rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired and drained most of the time, even when I do get some rest. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the exhaustion is coming from all the outside pressure and stress piling up, not because I\u2019m doing something wrong or failing personally. It\u2019s more like my body and mind are reacting to everything I\u2019m dealing with rather than me lacking effort.\nDoctor: That kind of exhaustion, especially when it feels tied to everything you\u2019re facing, can be really wearing. It makes total sense that your body and mind are reacting this way\u2014it\u2019s not about fault or failing. How has this ongoing stress been shaping your daily life or your ability to keep up with your usual responsibilities?\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely made keeping up with daily tasks a lot harder than usual. The stress just piles on, and combined with feeling restless and tired, it\u2019s tough to stay productive or focused. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the demands from outside are constantly pushing me, making it harder to get through even simple things. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it\u2019s wearing me down.\nDoctor: It sounds really challenging to keep up when even simple tasks feel overwhelming, and that kind of strain can chip away at your mood and motivation. What specific parts of your day or tasks have been hardest lately? How are those difficulties affecting how you\u2019re feeling overall?\nPatient: The hardest part has been balancing work responsibilities with family demands. Both sides come with expectations that, honestly, feel unrealistic given everything else I have going on.

I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m broken or anything, but it\u2019s clear that these unfair demands are taking a real toll on how I\u2019m managing day to day.\nDoctor: Have you noticed if activities or hobbies you used to enjoy feel less interesting or rewarding lately?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nHave you noticed if activities or hobbies you used to enjoy feel less interesting or rewarding lately?\n\nTask:\nDecide how the patient should respond next and output JSON only.",

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I've been feeling down some of the time\u2014nothing constant, but enough to notice. Sleep has been a real challenge; I find myself restless, waking up often, and struggling to get comfortable. That restlessness also makes it harder to focus during the day, so concentrating on my work has been tougher than usual. Overall, it\u2019s been a bit draining, but I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: When you say you\u2019re waking up often, how many times a night would you say that is? And when you\u2019re awake at those times, what kinds of thoughts or feelings are running through your mind?\nPatient: I usually wake up two or three times a night. When I\u2019m awake, it\u2019s more about feeling restless and irritated\u2014nothing like deep or overwhelming thoughts, really. I think a lot of it comes from external stressors, like noise or things going on around me, rather than something internal I\u2019m turning over in my head. It just feels frustrating and keeps me from settling back down easily.\nDoctor: Have you been feeling unusually guilty about things or like you\u2019re not good enough lately?\nPatient: There are times I do feel guilty, but it\u2019s more about the circumstances I\u2019m stuck in rather than thinking I\u2019m not good enough. It\u2019s frustrating, honestly\u2014like I\u2019m being held to expectations that don\u2019t really consider what I\u2019m dealing with. So, the guilt feels tied to outside pressures, not because I\u2019m blaming myself directly.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough feeling like expectations are being piled on without recognizing what you\u2019re going through. That kind of pressure can wear down anyone\u2014what\u2019s been the hardest part about managing those outside demands right now?\nPatient: The hardest part is trying to juggle everything when the expectations don\u2019t match up with the reality I\u2019m facing. Between work, school, and family stuff, it feels like there\u2019s always more being added without any real consideration for how stretched I already am. It\u2019s frustrating and makes me pretty restless and on edge most of the time. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it feels like an unfair weight that\u2019s just not letting up.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling restless and on edge\u2014have you noticed yourself moving more than usual, like pacing or fidgeting? Or, on the flip side, feeling slowed down in your movements or thoughts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed myself moving more\u2014pacing around sometimes or fidgeting when I\u2019m stuck on something. It\u2019s more about trying to burn off some of that built-up tension from all the pressure and stress coming at me. It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m slowed down or stuck, just kind of restless from everything going on outside of me.\nDoctor: That restless energy sounds intense. How does this constant need to move or burn off tension affect your daily routine or your mood throughout the day?\nPatient: It definitely throws off my routine\u2014I find myself pacing or fidgeting more than I\u2019d like, just trying to keep up with the stress. That kind of constant agitation wears on me, making me feel more irritable and tired as the day goes on. But honestly, I see it as a reaction to all the outside pressure rather than something wrong with me personally. It\u2019s frustrating, but it\u2019s how I\u2019m managing to keep going despite everything.\nDoctor: Given the stress you\u2019ve been under, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?\nPatient: Not really. I haven\u2019t seen any significant changes in my appetite or weight. Most of what I\u2019m dealing with seems tied to the external stress and pressure around me rather than anything physical like that. So, eating and weight have stayed about the same despite everything else.\nDoctor: How have your energy levels been lately? Do you find yourself feeling unusually tired or drained, even after getting some rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired and drained most of the time, even when I do get some rest. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the exhaustion is coming from all the outside pressure and stress piling up, not because I\u2019m doing something wrong or failing personally. It\u2019s more like my body and mind are reacting to everything I\u2019m dealing with rather than me lacking effort.\nDoctor: That kind of exhaustion, especially when it feels tied to everything you\u2019re facing, can be really wearing. It makes total sense that your body and mind are reacting this way\u2014it\u2019s not about fault or failing. How has this ongoing stress been shaping your daily life or your ability to keep up with your usual responsibilities?\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely made keeping up with daily tasks a lot harder than usual. The stress just piles on, and combined with feeling restless and tired, it\u2019s tough to stay productive or focused. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the demands from outside are constantly pushing me, making it harder to get through even simple things. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it\u2019s wearing me down.\nDoctor: It sounds really challenging to keep up when even simple tasks feel overwhelming, and that kind of strain can chip away at your mood and motivation. What specific parts of your day or tasks have been hardest lately? How are those difficulties affecting how you\u2019re feeling overall?\nPatient: The hardest part has been balancing work responsibilities with family demands. Both sides come with expectations that, honestly, feel unrealistic given everything else I have going on. It\u2019s frustrating because the constant pressure from outside wears me down and definitely drags my mood and motivation down too. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m broken or anything, but it\u2019s clear that these unfair demands are taking a real toll on how I\u2019m managing day to day.\nDoctor: Have you noticed if activities or hobbies you used to enjoy feel less interesting or rewarding lately?\nPatient: I wouldn\u2019t say they feel a lot less interesting, but the motivation to actually engage with them has definitely taken a hit. It\u2019s hard to fully get into things when there\u2019s so much pressure and stress from outside weighing on me. So, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve lost interest completely, but those external factors make it tougher to stay involved the way I want to.\nDoctor: Besides the stress and pressure, have you been feeling sad, empty, or tearful at times?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nBesides the stress and pressure, have you been feeling sad, empty, or tearful at times?\n\nTask:\nDecide how the patient should respond next and output JSON only.",

Most of what I\u2019m dealing with seems tied to the external stress and pressure around me rather than anything physical like that. So, eating and weight have stayed about the same despite everything else.\nDoctor: How have your energy levels been lately? Do you find yourself feeling unusually tired or drained, even after getting some rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired and drained most of the time, even when I do get some rest. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the exhaustion is coming from all the outside pressure and stress piling up, not because I\u2019m doing something wrong or failing personally. It\u2019s more like my body and mind are reacting to everything I\u2019m dealing with rather than me lacking effort.\nDoctor: That kind of exhaustion, especially when it feels tied to everything you\u2019re facing, can be really wearing. It makes total sense that your body and mind are reacting this way\u2014it\u2019s not about fault or failing. How has this ongoing stress been shaping your daily life or your ability to keep up with your usual responsibilities?\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely made keeping up with daily tasks a lot harder than usual. The stress just piles on, and combined with feeling restless and tired, it\u2019s tough to stay productive or focused. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the demands from outside are constantly pushing me, making it harder to get through even simple things. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it\u2019s wearing me down.\nDoctor: It sounds really challenging to keep up when even simple tasks feel overwhelming, and that kind of strain can chip away at your mood and motivation. What specific parts of your day or tasks have been hardest lately? How are those difficulties affecting how you\u2019re feeling overall?\nPatient: The hardest part has been balancing work responsibilities with family demands. Both sides come with expectations that, honestly, feel unrealistic given everything else I have going on. It\u2019s frustrating because the constant pressure from outside wears me down and definitely drags my mood and motivation down too. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m broken or anything, but it\u2019s clear that these unfair demands are taking a real toll on how I\u2019m managing day to day.\nDoctor: Have you noticed if activities or hobbies you used to enjoy feel less interesting or rewarding lately?\nPatient: I wouldn\u2019t say they feel a lot less interesting, but the motivation to actually engage with them has definitely taken a hit. It\u2019s hard to fully get into things when there\u2019s so much pressure and stress from outside weighing on me. So, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve lost interest completely, but those external factors make it tougher to stay involved the way I want to.\nDoctor: Besides the stress and pressure, have you been feeling sad, empty, or tearful at times?\nPatient: Yeah, there are definitely times I feel down beyond just the stress. But mostly, those feelings come from the outside pressures and the way they pile up.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I've been feeling down some of the time\u2014nothing constant, but enough to notice. Sleep has been a real challenge; I find myself restless, waking up often, and struggling to get comfortable. That restlessness also makes it harder to focus during the day, so concentrating on my work has been tougher than usual. Overall, it\u2019s been a bit draining, but I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: When you say you\u2019re waking up often, how many times a night would you say that is? And when you\u2019re awake at those times, what kinds of thoughts or feelings are running through your mind?\nPatient: I usually wake up two or three times a night. When I\u2019m awake, it\u2019s more about feeling restless and irritated\u2014nothing like deep or overwhelming thoughts, really. I think a lot of it comes from external stressors, like noise or things going on around me, rather than something internal I\u2019m turning over in my head. It just feels frustrating and keeps me from settling back down easily.\nDoctor: Have you been feeling unusually guilty about things or like you\u2019re not good enough lately?\nPatient: There are times I do feel guilty, but it\u2019s more about the circumstances I\u2019m stuck in rather than thinking I\u2019m not good enough. It\u2019s frustrating, honestly\u2014like I\u2019m being held to expectations that don\u2019t really consider what I\u2019m dealing with. So, the guilt feels tied to outside pressures, not because I\u2019m blaming myself directly.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough feeling like expectations are being piled on without recognizing what you\u2019re going through. That kind of pressure can wear down anyone\u2014what\u2019s been the hardest part about managing those outside demands right now?\nPatient: The hardest part is trying to juggle everything when the expectations don\u2019t match up with the reality I\u2019m facing. Between work, school, and family stuff, it feels like there\u2019s always more being added without any real consideration for how stretched I already am. It\u2019s frustrating and makes me pretty restless and on edge most of the time. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it feels like an unfair weight that\u2019s just not letting up.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling restless and on edge\u2014have you noticed yourself moving more than usual, like pacing or fidgeting? Or, on the flip side, feeling slowed down in your movements or thoughts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed myself moving more\u2014pacing around sometimes or fidgeting when I\u2019m stuck on something. It\u2019s more about trying to burn off some of that built-up tension from all the pressure and stress coming at me. It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m slowed down or stuck, just kind of restless from everything going on outside of me.\nDoctor: That restless energy sounds intense. How does this constant need to move or burn off tension affect your daily routine or your mood throughout the day?\nPatient: It definitely throws off my routine\u2014I find myself pacing or fidgeting more than I\u2019d like, just trying to keep up with the stress. That kind of constant agitation wears on me, making me feel more irritable and tired as the day goes on. But honestly, I see it as a reaction to all the outside pressure rather than something wrong with me personally. It\u2019s frustrating, but it\u2019s how I\u2019m managing to keep going despite everything.\nDoctor: Given the stress you\u2019ve been under, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?\nPatient: Not really. I haven\u2019t seen any significant changes in my appetite or weight. Most of what I\u2019m dealing with seems tied to the external stress and pressure around me rather than anything physical like that.

It\u2019s more like my body and mind are reacting to everything I\u2019m dealing with rather than me lacking effort.\nDoctor: That kind of exhaustion, especially when it feels tied to everything you\u2019re facing, can be really wearing. It makes total sense that your body and mind are reacting this way\u2014it\u2019s not about fault or failing.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I've been feeling down some of the time\u2014nothing constant, but enough to notice. Sleep has been a real challenge; I find myself restless, waking up often, and struggling to get comfortable. That restlessness also makes it harder to focus during the day, so concentrating on my work has been tougher than usual. Overall, it\u2019s been a bit draining, but I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: When you say you\u2019re waking up often, how many times a night would you say that is? And when you\u2019re awake at those times, what kinds of thoughts or feelings are running through your mind?\nPatient: I usually wake up two or three times a night. When I\u2019m awake, it\u2019s more about feeling restless and irritated\u2014nothing like deep or overwhelming thoughts, really. I think a lot of it comes from external stressors, like noise or things going on around me, rather than something internal I\u2019m turning over in my head. It just feels frustrating and keeps me from settling back down easily.\nDoctor: Have you been feeling unusually guilty about things or like you\u2019re not good enough lately?\nPatient: There are times I do feel guilty, but it\u2019s more about the circumstances I\u2019m stuck in rather than thinking I\u2019m not good enough. It\u2019s frustrating, honestly\u2014like I\u2019m being held to expectations that don\u2019t really consider what I\u2019m dealing with. So, the guilt feels tied to outside pressures, not because I\u2019m blaming myself directly.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough feeling like expectations are being piled on without recognizing what you\u2019re going through. That kind of pressure can wear down anyone\u2014what\u2019s been the hardest part about managing those outside demands right now?\nPatient: The hardest part is trying to juggle everything when the expectations don\u2019t match up with the reality I\u2019m facing. Between work, school, and family stuff, it feels like there\u2019s always more being added without any real consideration for how stretched I already am. It\u2019s frustrating and makes me pretty restless and on edge most of the time. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it feels like an unfair weight that\u2019s just not letting up.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling restless and on edge\u2014have you noticed yourself moving more than usual, like pacing or fidgeting? Or, on the flip side, feeling slowed down in your movements or thoughts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed myself moving more\u2014pacing around sometimes or fidgeting when I\u2019m stuck on something. It\u2019s more about trying to burn off some of that built-up tension from all the pressure and stress coming at me. It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m slowed down or stuck, just kind of restless from everything going on outside of me.\nDoctor: That restless energy sounds intense. How does this constant need to move or burn off tension affect your daily routine or your mood throughout the day?\nPatient: It definitely throws off my routine\u2014I find myself pacing or fidgeting more than I\u2019d like, just trying to keep up with the stress. That kind of constant agitation wears on me, making me feel more irritable and tired as the day goes on. But honestly, I see it as a reaction to all the outside pressure rather than something wrong with me personally. It\u2019s frustrating, but it\u2019s how I\u2019m managing to keep going despite everything.\nDoctor: Given the stress you\u2019ve been under, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?\nPatient: Not really. I haven\u2019t seen any significant changes in my appetite or weight. Most of what I\u2019m dealing with seems tied to the external stress and pressure around me rather than anything physical like that. So, eating and weight have stayed about the same despite everything else.\nDoctor: How have your energy levels been lately? Do you find yourself feeling unusually tired or drained, even after getting some rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired and drained most of the time, even when I do get some rest. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the exhaustion is coming from all the outside pressure and stress piling up, not because I\u2019m doing something wrong or failing personally. It\u2019s more like my body and mind are reacting to everything I\u2019m dealing with rather than me lacking effort.\nDoctor: That kind of exhaustion, especially when it feels tied to everything you\u2019re facing, can be really wearing. It makes total sense that your body and mind are reacting this way\u2014it\u2019s not about fault or failing. How has this ongoing stress been shaping your daily life or your ability to keep up with your usual responsibilities?\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely made keeping up with daily tasks a lot harder than usual. The stress just piles on, and combined with feeling restless and tired, it\u2019s tough to stay productive or focused. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the demands from outside are constantly pushing me, making it harder to get through even simple things. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it\u2019s wearing me down.\nDoctor: It sounds really challenging to keep up when even simple tasks feel overwhelming, and that kind of strain can chip away at your mood and motivation. What specific parts of your day or tasks have been hardest lately? How are those difficulties affecting how you\u2019re feeling overall?\nPatient: The hardest part has been balancing work responsibilities with family demands. Both sides come with expectations that, honestly, feel unrealistic given everything else I have going on. It\u2019s frustrating because the constant pressure from outside wears me down and definitely drags my mood and motivation down too. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m broken or anything, but it\u2019s clear that these unfair demands are taking a real toll on how I\u2019m managing day to day.\nDoctor: Have you noticed if activities or hobbies you used to enjoy feel less interesting or rewarding lately?\nPatient: I wouldn\u2019t say they feel a lot less interesting, but the motivation to actually engage with them has definitely taken a hit. It\u2019s hard to fully get into things when there\u2019s so much pressure and stress from outside weighing on me. So, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve lost interest completely, but those external factors make it tougher to stay involved the way I want to.\nDoctor: Besides the stress and pressure, have you been feeling sad, empty, or tearful at times?\nPatient: Yeah, there are definitely times I feel down beyond just the stress. But mostly, those feelings come from the outside pressures and the way they pile up. It\u2019s frustrating and wears on me, but I wouldn\u2019t call it some deep emptiness\u2014more a reaction to everything going on around me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that with all the pressure, these feelings would come up. How often are you feeling down like this, and how strong are those feelings when they happen? Do they get in the way of your day-to-day life or your connections with people around you?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I feel down enough to notice it several days a week, but it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. When it hits, it\u2019s definitely tied to all the external stress I\u2019m dealing with.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I've been feeling down some of the time\u2014nothing constant, but enough to notice. Sleep has been a real challenge; I find myself restless, waking up often, and struggling to get comfortable. That restlessness also makes it harder to focus during the day, so concentrating on my work has been tougher than usual. Overall, it\u2019s been a bit draining, but I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: When you say you\u2019re waking up often, how many times a night would you say that is? And when you\u2019re awake at those times, what kinds of thoughts or feelings are running through your mind?\nPatient: I usually wake up two or three times a night. When I\u2019m awake, it\u2019s more about feeling restless and irritated\u2014nothing like deep or overwhelming thoughts, really. I think a lot of it comes from external stressors, like noise or things going on around me, rather than something internal I\u2019m turning over in my head. It just feels frustrating and keeps me from settling back down easily.\nDoctor: Have you been feeling unusually guilty about things or like you\u2019re not good enough lately?\nPatient: There are times I do feel guilty, but it\u2019s more about the circumstances I\u2019m stuck in rather than thinking I\u2019m not good enough. It\u2019s frustrating, honestly\u2014like I\u2019m being held to expectations that don\u2019t really consider what I\u2019m dealing with. So, the guilt feels tied to outside pressures, not because I\u2019m blaming myself directly.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough feeling like expectations are being piled on without recognizing what you\u2019re going through. That kind of pressure can wear down anyone\u2014what\u2019s been the hardest part about managing those outside demands right now?\nPatient: The hardest part is trying to juggle everything when the expectations don\u2019t match up with the reality I\u2019m facing. Between work, school, and family stuff, it feels like there\u2019s always more being added without any real consideration for how stretched I already am. It\u2019s frustrating and makes me pretty restless and on edge most of the time. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it feels like an unfair weight that\u2019s just not letting up.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling restless and on edge\u2014have you noticed yourself moving more than usual, like pacing or fidgeting? Or, on the flip side, feeling slowed down in your movements or thoughts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed myself moving more\u2014pacing around sometimes or fidgeting when I\u2019m stuck on something. It\u2019s more about trying to burn off some of that built-up tension from all the pressure and stress coming at me. It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m slowed down or stuck, just kind of restless from everything going on outside of me.\nDoctor: That restless energy sounds intense. How does this constant need to move or burn off tension affect your daily routine or your mood throughout the day?\nPatient: It definitely throws off my routine\u2014I find myself pacing or fidgeting more than I\u2019d like, just trying to keep up with the stress. That kind of constant agitation wears on me, making me feel more irritable and tired as the day goes on. But honestly, I see it as a reaction to all the outside pressure rather than something wrong with me personally. It\u2019s frustrating, but it\u2019s how I\u2019m managing to keep going despite everything.\nDoctor: Given the stress you\u2019ve been under, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?\nPatient: Not really. I haven\u2019t seen any significant changes in my appetite or weight. Most of what I\u2019m dealing with seems tied to the external stress and pressure around me rather than anything physical like that. So, eating and weight have stayed about the same despite everything else.\nDoctor: How have your energy levels been lately? Do you find yourself feeling unusually tired or drained, even after getting some rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired and drained most of the time, even when I do get some rest. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the exhaustion is coming from all the outside pressure and stress piling up, not because I\u2019m doing something wrong or failing personally. It\u2019s more like my body and mind are reacting to everything I\u2019m dealing with rather than me lacking effort.\nDoctor: That kind of exhaustion, especially when it feels tied to everything you\u2019re facing, can be really wearing. It makes total sense that your body and mind are reacting this way\u2014it\u2019s not about fault or failing. How has this ongoing stress been shaping your daily life or your ability to keep up with your usual responsibilities?\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely made keeping up with daily tasks a lot harder than usual. The stress just piles on, and combined with feeling restless and tired, it\u2019s tough to stay productive or focused. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the demands from outside are constantly pushing me, making it harder to get through even simple things. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it\u2019s wearing me down.\nDoctor: It sounds really challenging to keep up when even simple tasks feel overwhelming, and that kind of strain can chip away at your mood and motivation. What specific parts of your day or tasks have been hardest lately? How are those difficulties affecting how you\u2019re feeling overall?\nPatient: The hardest part has been balancing work responsibilities with family demands. Both sides come with expectations that, honestly, feel unrealistic given everything else I have going on. It\u2019s frustrating because the constant pressure from outside wears me down and definitely drags my mood and motivation down too. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m broken or anything, but it\u2019s clear that these unfair demands are taking a real toll on how I\u2019m managing day to day.\nDoctor: Have you noticed if activities or hobbies you used to enjoy feel less interesting or rewarding lately?\nPatient: I wouldn\u2019t say they feel a lot less interesting, but the motivation to actually engage with them has definitely taken a hit. It\u2019s hard to fully get into things when there\u2019s so much pressure and stress from outside weighing on me. So, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve lost interest completely, but those external factors make it tougher to stay involved the way I want to.\nDoctor: Besides the stress and pressure, have you been feeling sad, empty, or tearful at times?\nPatient: Yeah, there are definitely times I feel down beyond just the stress. But mostly, those feelings come from the outside pressures and the way they pile up. It\u2019s frustrating and wears on me, but I wouldn\u2019t call it some deep emptiness\u2014more a reaction to everything going on around me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that with all the pressure, these feelings would come up. How often are you feeling down like this, and how strong are those feelings when they happen? Do they get in the way of your day-to-day life or your connections with people around you?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I feel down enough to notice it several days a week, but it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. When it hits, it\u2019s definitely tied to all the external stress I\u2019m dealing with. The mood does affect how I get through daily tasks and sometimes makes social stuff a bit harder, but I think that\u2019s just a natural response to the situation rather than something wrong with me personally.\nDoctor: You have a clear understanding of how these feelings connect to the stress you\u2019re facing, and it makes sense they come and go with what\u2019s happening around you. It\u2019s tough to juggle all that and keep going\u2014it\u2019s a natural response to real pressure, not a personal flaw. It\u2019s good you\u2019re noticing this pattern; it helps us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019m aware that a lot of what I\u2019m feeling is tied to the stress from outside, and it\u2019s not about some flaw or failing on my part. It\u2019s challenging, no doubt, but recognizing that connection helps me stay realistic about what\u2019s going on.

It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m slowed down or stuck, just kind of restless from everything going on outside of me.\nDoctor: That restless energy sounds intense. How does this constant need to move or burn off tension affect your daily routine or your mood throughout the day?\nPatient: It definitely throws off my routine\u2014I find myself pacing or fidgeting more than I\u2019d like, just trying to keep up with the stress. That kind of constant agitation wears on me, making me feel more irritable and tired as the day goes on. But honestly, I see it as a reaction to all the outside pressure rather than something wrong with me personally. It\u2019s frustrating, but it\u2019s how I\u2019m managing to keep going despite everything.\nDoctor: Given the stress you\u2019ve been under, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?\nPatient: Not really. I haven\u2019t seen any significant changes in my appetite or weight. Most of what I\u2019m dealing with seems tied to the external stress and pressure around me rather than anything physical like that. So, eating and weight have stayed about the same despite everything else.\nDoctor: How have your energy levels been lately? Do you find yourself feeling unusually tired or drained, even after getting some rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired and drained most of the time, even when I do get some rest. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the exhaustion is coming from all the outside pressure and stress piling up, not because I\u2019m doing something wrong or failing personally. It\u2019s more like my body and mind are reacting to everything I\u2019m dealing with rather than me lacking effort.\nDoctor: That kind of exhaustion, especially when it feels tied to everything you\u2019re facing, can be really wearing. It makes total sense that your body and mind are reacting this way\u2014it\u2019s not about fault or failing. How has this ongoing stress been shaping your daily life or your ability to keep up with your usual responsibilities?\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely made keeping up with daily tasks a lot harder than usual. The stress just piles on, and combined with feeling restless and tired, it\u2019s tough to stay productive or focused. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the demands from outside are constantly pushing me, making it harder to get through even simple things. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it\u2019s wearing me down.\nDoctor: It sounds really challenging to keep up when even simple tasks feel overwhelming, and that kind of strain can chip away at your mood and motivation. What specific parts of your day or tasks have been hardest lately? How are those difficulties affecting how you\u2019re feeling overall?\nPatient: The hardest part has been balancing work responsibilities with family demands. Both sides come with expectations that, honestly, feel unrealistic given everything else I have going on. It\u2019s frustrating because the constant pressure from outside wears me down and definitely drags my mood and motivation down too. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m broken or anything, but it\u2019s clear that these unfair demands are taking a real toll on how I\u2019m managing day to day.\nDoctor: Have you noticed if activities or hobbies you used to enjoy feel less interesting or rewarding lately?\nPatient: I wouldn\u2019t say they feel a lot less interesting, but the motivation to actually engage with them has definitely taken a hit. It\u2019s hard to fully get into things when there\u2019s so much pressure and stress from outside weighing on me. So, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve lost interest completely, but those external factors make it tougher to stay involved the way I want to.\nDoctor: Besides the stress and pressure, have you been feeling sad, empty, or tearful at times?\nPatient: Yeah, there are definitely times I feel down beyond just the stress. But mostly, those feelings come from the outside pressures and the way they pile up. It\u2019s frustrating and wears on me, but I wouldn\u2019t call it some deep emptiness\u2014more a reaction to everything going on around me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that with all the pressure, these feelings would come up. How often are you feeling down like this, and how strong are those feelings when they happen? Do they get in the way of your day-to-day life or your connections with people around you?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I feel down enough to notice it several days a week, but it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. When it hits, it\u2019s definitely tied to all the external stress I\u2019m dealing with. The mood does affect how I get through daily tasks and sometimes makes social stuff a bit harder, but I think that\u2019s just a natural response to the situation rather than something wrong with me personally.\nDoctor: You have a clear understanding of how these feelings connect to the stress you\u2019re facing, and it makes sense they come and go with what\u2019s happening around you. It\u2019s tough to juggle all that and keep going\u2014it\u2019s a natural response to real pressure, not a personal flaw. It\u2019s good you\u2019re noticing this pattern; it helps us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019m aware that a lot of what I\u2019m feeling is tied to the stress from outside, and it\u2019s not about some flaw or failing on my part. It\u2019s challenging, no doubt, but recognizing that connection helps me stay realistic about what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m doing what I can to keep up, even if it\u2019s tough, and knowing this isn\u2019t just me breaking down makes it a bit easier to manage.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad you have that awareness\u2014it\u2019s important. To be thorough, I need to ask: have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nI\u2019m glad you have that awareness\u2014it\u2019s important.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I've been feeling down some of the time\u2014nothing constant, but enough to notice. Sleep has been a real challenge; I find myself restless, waking up often, and struggling to get comfortable. That restlessness also makes it harder to focus during the day, so concentrating on my work has been tougher than usual. Overall, it\u2019s been a bit draining, but I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: When you say you\u2019re waking up often, how many times a night would you say that is? And when you\u2019re awake at those times, what kinds of thoughts or feelings are running through your mind?\nPatient: I usually wake up two or three times a night. When I\u2019m awake, it\u2019s more about feeling restless and irritated\u2014nothing like deep or overwhelming thoughts, really. I think a lot of it comes from external stressors, like noise or things going on around me, rather than something internal I\u2019m turning over in my head. It just feels frustrating and keeps me from settling back down easily.\nDoctor: Have you been feeling unusually guilty about things or like you\u2019re not good enough lately?\nPatient: There are times I do feel guilty, but it\u2019s more about the circumstances I\u2019m stuck in rather than thinking I\u2019m not good enough. It\u2019s frustrating, honestly\u2014like I\u2019m being held to expectations that don\u2019t really consider what I\u2019m dealing with. So, the guilt feels tied to outside pressures, not because I\u2019m blaming myself directly.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough feeling like expectations are being piled on without recognizing what you\u2019re going through. That kind of pressure can wear down anyone\u2014what\u2019s been the hardest part about managing those outside demands right now?\nPatient: The hardest part is trying to juggle everything when the expectations don\u2019t match up with the reality I\u2019m facing. Between work, school, and family stuff, it feels like there\u2019s always more being added without any real consideration for how stretched I already am. It\u2019s frustrating and makes me pretty restless and on edge most of the time. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it feels like an unfair weight that\u2019s just not letting up.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling restless and on edge\u2014have you noticed yourself moving more than usual, like pacing or fidgeting? Or, on the flip side, feeling slowed down in your movements or thoughts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed myself moving more\u2014pacing around sometimes or fidgeting when I\u2019m stuck on something.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I've been feeling down some of the time\u2014nothing constant, but enough to notice. Sleep has been a real challenge; I find myself restless, waking up often, and struggling to get comfortable. That restlessness also makes it harder to focus during the day, so concentrating on my work has been tougher than usual. Overall, it\u2019s been a bit draining, but I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: When you say you\u2019re waking up often, how many times a night would you say that is? And when you\u2019re awake at those times, what kinds of thoughts or feelings are running through your mind?\nPatient: I usually wake up two or three times a night. When I\u2019m awake, it\u2019s more about feeling restless and irritated\u2014nothing like deep or overwhelming thoughts, really. I think a lot of it comes from external stressors, like noise or things going on around me, rather than something internal I\u2019m turning over in my head. It just feels frustrating and keeps me from settling back down easily.\nDoctor: Have you been feeling unusually guilty about things or like you\u2019re not good enough lately?\nPatient: There are times I do feel guilty, but it\u2019s more about the circumstances I\u2019m stuck in rather than thinking I\u2019m not good enough. It\u2019s frustrating, honestly\u2014like I\u2019m being held to expectations that don\u2019t really consider what I\u2019m dealing with. So, the guilt feels tied to outside pressures, not because I\u2019m blaming myself directly.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough feeling like expectations are being piled on without recognizing what you\u2019re going through. That kind of pressure can wear down anyone\u2014what\u2019s been the hardest part about managing those outside demands right now?\nPatient: The hardest part is trying to juggle everything when the expectations don\u2019t match up with the reality I\u2019m facing. Between work, school, and family stuff, it feels like there\u2019s always more being added without any real consideration for how stretched I already am. It\u2019s frustrating and makes me pretty restless and on edge most of the time. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it feels like an unfair weight that\u2019s just not letting up.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling restless and on edge\u2014have you noticed yourself moving more than usual, like pacing or fidgeting? Or, on the flip side, feeling slowed down in your movements or thoughts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed myself moving more\u2014pacing around sometimes or fidgeting when I\u2019m stuck on something. It\u2019s more about trying to burn off some of that built-up tension from all the pressure and stress coming at me. It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m slowed down or stuck, just kind of restless from everything going on outside of me.\nDoctor: That restless energy sounds intense. How does this constant need to move or burn off tension affect your daily routine or your mood throughout the day?\nPatient: It definitely throws off my routine\u2014I find myself pacing or fidgeting more than I\u2019d like, just trying to keep up with the stress. That kind of constant agitation wears on me, making me feel more irritable and tired as the day goes on. But honestly, I see it as a reaction to all the outside pressure rather than something wrong with me personally. It\u2019s frustrating, but it\u2019s how I\u2019m managing to keep going despite everything.\nDoctor: Given the stress you\u2019ve been under, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?\nPatient: Not really. I haven\u2019t seen any significant changes in my appetite or weight. Most of what I\u2019m dealing with seems tied to the external stress and pressure around me rather than anything physical like that. So, eating and weight have stayed about the same despite everything else.\nDoctor: How have your energy levels been lately? Do you find yourself feeling unusually tired or drained, even after getting some rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired and drained most of the time, even when I do get some rest. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the exhaustion is coming from all the outside pressure and stress piling up, not because I\u2019m doing something wrong or failing personally. It\u2019s more like my body and mind are reacting to everything I\u2019m dealing with rather than me lacking effort.\nDoctor: That kind of exhaustion, especially when it feels tied to everything you\u2019re facing, can be really wearing. It makes total sense that your body and mind are reacting this way\u2014it\u2019s not about fault or failing. How has this ongoing stress been shaping your daily life or your ability to keep up with your usual responsibilities?\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely made keeping up with daily tasks a lot harder than usual. The stress just piles on, and combined with feeling restless and tired, it\u2019s tough to stay productive or focused. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the demands from outside are constantly pushing me, making it harder to get through even simple things. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it\u2019s wearing me down.\nDoctor: It sounds really challenging to keep up when even simple tasks feel overwhelming, and that kind of strain can chip away at your mood and motivation. What specific parts of your day or tasks have been hardest lately? How are those difficulties affecting how you\u2019re feeling overall?\nPatient: The hardest part has been balancing work responsibilities with family demands. Both sides come with expectations that, honestly, feel unrealistic given everything else I have going on. It\u2019s frustrating because the constant pressure from outside wears me down and definitely drags my mood and motivation down too. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m broken or anything, but it\u2019s clear that these unfair demands are taking a real toll on how I\u2019m managing day to day.\nDoctor: Have you noticed if activities or hobbies you used to enjoy feel less interesting or rewarding lately?\nPatient: I wouldn\u2019t say they feel a lot less interesting, but the motivation to actually engage with them has definitely taken a hit. It\u2019s hard to fully get into things when there\u2019s so much pressure and stress from outside weighing on me. So, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve lost interest completely, but those external factors make it tougher to stay involved the way I want to.\nDoctor: Besides the stress and pressure, have you been feeling sad, empty, or tearful at times?\nPatient: Yeah, there are definitely times I feel down beyond just the stress. But mostly, those feelings come from the outside pressures and the way they pile up. It\u2019s frustrating and wears on me, but I wouldn\u2019t call it some deep emptiness\u2014more a reaction to everything going on around me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that with all the pressure, these feelings would come up. How often are you feeling down like this, and how strong are those feelings when they happen? Do they get in the way of your day-to-day life or your connections with people around you?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I feel down enough to notice it several days a week, but it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. When it hits, it\u2019s definitely tied to all the external stress I\u2019m dealing with. The mood does affect how I get through daily tasks and sometimes makes social stuff a bit harder, but I think that\u2019s just a natural response to the situation rather than something wrong with me personally.\nDoctor: You have a clear understanding of how these feelings connect to the stress you\u2019re facing, and it makes sense they come and go with what\u2019s happening around you. It\u2019s tough to juggle all that and keep going\u2014it\u2019s a natural response to real pressure, not a personal flaw. It\u2019s good you\u2019re noticing this pattern; it helps us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019m aware that a lot of what I\u2019m feeling is tied to the stress from outside, and it\u2019s not about some flaw or failing on my part. It\u2019s challenging, no doubt, but recognizing that connection helps me stay realistic about what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m doing what I can to keep up, even if it\u2019s tough, and knowing this isn\u2019t just me breaking down makes it a bit easier to manage.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad you have that awareness\u2014it\u2019s important. To be thorough, I need to ask: have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently?\nPatient: Occasionally, I have fleeting thoughts about death, but they\u2019re rare and don\u2019t involve any plans or intent. It feels more like a reaction to the ongoing stress and pressure outside rather than something coming from inside me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s not easy to share even rare thoughts like that, so I appreciate your honesty. Given everything you\u2019re managing, it\u2019s understandable these feelings come up. When those thoughts happen, how do you usually handle or cope with them?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nIt\u2019s not easy to share even rare thoughts like that, so I appreciate your honesty.

It\u2019s frustrating and wears on me, but I wouldn\u2019t call it some deep emptiness\u2014more a reaction to everything going on around me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that with all the pressure, these feelings would come up. How often are you feeling down like this, and how strong are those feelings when they happen? Do they get in the way of your day-to-day life or your connections with people around you?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I feel down enough to notice it several days a week, but it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. When it hits, it\u2019s definitely tied to all the external stress I\u2019m dealing with. The mood does affect how I get through daily tasks and sometimes makes social stuff a bit harder, but I think that\u2019s just a natural response to the situation rather than something wrong with me personally.\nDoctor: You have a clear understanding of how these feelings connect to the stress you\u2019re facing, and it makes sense they come and go with what\u2019s happening around you. It\u2019s tough to juggle all that and keep going\u2014it\u2019s a natural response to real pressure, not a personal flaw. It\u2019s good you\u2019re noticing this pattern; it helps us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019m aware that a lot of what I\u2019m feeling is tied to the stress from outside, and it\u2019s not about some flaw or failing on my part. It\u2019s challenging, no doubt, but recognizing that connection helps me stay realistic about what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m doing what I can to keep up, even if it\u2019s tough, and knowing this isn\u2019t just me breaking down makes it a bit easier to manage.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad you have that awareness\u2014it\u2019s important. To be thorough, I need to ask: have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently?\nPatient: Occasionally, I have fleeting thoughts about death, but they\u2019re rare and don\u2019t involve any plans or intent. It feels more like a reaction to the ongoing stress and pressure outside rather than something coming from inside me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s not easy to share even rare thoughts like that, so I appreciate your honesty. Given everything you\u2019re managing, it\u2019s understandable these feelings come up. When those thoughts happen, how do you usually handle or cope with them?\nPatient: When those thoughts come up, I mostly try to keep busy or focus on tasks around me to distract myself. It\u2019s a way to manage the stress and not dwell on the feelings. Since they\u2019re rare and usually fleeting, staying occupied helps prevent them from taking hold.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I've been feeling down some of the time\u2014nothing constant, but enough to notice. Sleep has been a real challenge; I find myself restless, waking up often, and struggling to get comfortable. That restlessness also makes it harder to focus during the day, so concentrating on my work has been tougher than usual. Overall, it\u2019s been a bit draining, but I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: When you say you\u2019re waking up often, how many times a night would you say that is? And when you\u2019re awake at those times, what kinds of thoughts or feelings are running through your mind?\nPatient: I usually wake up two or three times a night. When I\u2019m awake, it\u2019s more about feeling restless and irritated\u2014nothing like deep or overwhelming thoughts, really. I think a lot of it comes from external stressors, like noise or things going on around me, rather than something internal I\u2019m turning over in my head. It just feels frustrating and keeps me from settling back down easily.\nDoctor: Have you been feeling unusually guilty about things or like you\u2019re not good enough lately?\nPatient: There are times I do feel guilty, but it\u2019s more about the circumstances I\u2019m stuck in rather than thinking I\u2019m not good enough. It\u2019s frustrating, honestly\u2014like I\u2019m being held to expectations that don\u2019t really consider what I\u2019m dealing with. So, the guilt feels tied to outside pressures, not because I\u2019m blaming myself directly.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough feeling like expectations are being piled on without recognizing what you\u2019re going through. That kind of pressure can wear down anyone\u2014what\u2019s been the hardest part about managing those outside demands right now?\nPatient: The hardest part is trying to juggle everything when the expectations don\u2019t match up with the reality I\u2019m facing. Between work, school, and family stuff, it feels like there\u2019s always more being added without any real consideration for how stretched I already am. It\u2019s frustrating and makes me pretty restless and on edge most of the time. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it feels like an unfair weight that\u2019s just not letting up.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling restless and on edge\u2014have you noticed yourself moving more than usual, like pacing or fidgeting? Or, on the flip side, feeling slowed down in your movements or thoughts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed myself moving more\u2014pacing around sometimes or fidgeting when I\u2019m stuck on something. It\u2019s more about trying to burn off some of that built-up tension from all the pressure and stress coming at me. It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m slowed down or stuck, just kind of restless from everything going on outside of me.\nDoctor: That restless energy sounds intense. How does this constant need to move or burn off tension affect your daily routine or your mood throughout the day?\nPatient: It definitely throws off my routine\u2014I find myself pacing or fidgeting more than I\u2019d like, just trying to keep up with the stress. That kind of constant agitation wears on me, making me feel more irritable and tired as the day goes on. But honestly, I see it as a reaction to all the outside pressure rather than something wrong with me personally. It\u2019s frustrating, but it\u2019s how I\u2019m managing to keep going despite everything.\nDoctor: Given the stress you\u2019ve been under, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?\nPatient: Not really. I haven\u2019t seen any significant changes in my appetite or weight. Most of what I\u2019m dealing with seems tied to the external stress and pressure around me rather than anything physical like that. So, eating and weight have stayed about the same despite everything else.\nDoctor: How have your energy levels been lately? Do you find yourself feeling unusually tired or drained, even after getting some rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired and drained most of the time, even when I do get some rest. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the exhaustion is coming from all the outside pressure and stress piling up, not because I\u2019m doing something wrong or failing personally. It\u2019s more like my body and mind are reacting to everything I\u2019m dealing with rather than me lacking effort.\nDoctor: That kind of exhaustion, especially when it feels tied to everything you\u2019re facing, can be really wearing. It makes total sense that your body and mind are reacting this way\u2014it\u2019s not about fault or failing. How has this ongoing stress been shaping your daily life or your ability to keep up with your usual responsibilities?\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely made keeping up with daily tasks a lot harder than usual. The stress just piles on, and combined with feeling restless and tired, it\u2019s tough to stay productive or focused. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the demands from outside are constantly pushing me, making it harder to get through even simple things. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it\u2019s wearing me down.\nDoctor: It sounds really challenging to keep up when even simple tasks feel overwhelming, and that kind of strain can chip away at your mood and motivation. What specific parts of your day or tasks have been hardest lately? How are those difficulties affecting how you\u2019re feeling overall?\nPatient: The hardest part has been balancing work responsibilities with family demands. Both sides come with expectations that, honestly, feel unrealistic given everything else I have going on. It\u2019s frustrating because the constant pressure from outside wears me down and definitely drags my mood and motivation down too. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m broken or anything, but it\u2019s clear that these unfair demands are taking a real toll on how I\u2019m managing day to day.\nDoctor: Have you noticed if activities or hobbies you used to enjoy feel less interesting or rewarding lately?\nPatient: I wouldn\u2019t say they feel a lot less interesting, but the motivation to actually engage with them has definitely taken a hit. It\u2019s hard to fully get into things when there\u2019s so much pressure and stress from outside weighing on me. So, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve lost interest completely, but those external factors make it tougher to stay involved the way I want to.\nDoctor: Besides the stress and pressure, have you been feeling sad, empty, or tearful at times?\nPatient: Yeah, there are definitely times I feel down beyond just the stress.

Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I've been feeling down some of the time\u2014nothing constant, but enough to notice. Sleep has been a real challenge; I find myself restless, waking up often, and struggling to get comfortable. That restlessness also makes it harder to focus during the day, so concentrating on my work has been tougher than usual. Overall, it\u2019s been a bit draining, but I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: When you say you\u2019re waking up often, how many times a night would you say that is? And when you\u2019re awake at those times, what kinds of thoughts or feelings are running through your mind?\nPatient: I usually wake up two or three times a night. When I\u2019m awake, it\u2019s more about feeling restless and irritated\u2014nothing like deep or overwhelming thoughts, really. I think a lot of it comes from external stressors, like noise or things going on around me, rather than something internal I\u2019m turning over in my head. It just feels frustrating and keeps me from settling back down easily.\nDoctor: Have you been feeling unusually guilty about things or like you\u2019re not good enough lately?\nPatient: There are times I do feel guilty, but it\u2019s more about the circumstances I\u2019m stuck in rather than thinking I\u2019m not good enough. It\u2019s frustrating, honestly\u2014like I\u2019m being held to expectations that don\u2019t really consider what I\u2019m dealing with. So, the guilt feels tied to outside pressures, not because I\u2019m blaming myself directly.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough feeling like expectations are being piled on without recognizing what you\u2019re going through. That kind of pressure can wear down anyone\u2014what\u2019s been the hardest part about managing those outside demands right now?\nPatient: The hardest part is trying to juggle everything when the expectations don\u2019t match up with the reality I\u2019m facing. Between work, school, and family stuff, it feels like there\u2019s always more being added without any real consideration for how stretched I already am. It\u2019s frustrating and makes me pretty restless and on edge most of the time. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it feels like an unfair weight that\u2019s just not letting up.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling restless and on edge\u2014have you noticed yourself moving more than usual, like pacing or fidgeting? Or, on the flip side, feeling slowed down in your movements or thoughts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed myself moving more\u2014pacing around sometimes or fidgeting when I\u2019m stuck on something. It\u2019s more about trying to burn off some of that built-up tension from all the pressure and stress coming at me. It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m slowed down or stuck, just kind of restless from everything going on outside of me.\nDoctor: That restless energy sounds intense. How does this constant need to move or burn off tension affect your daily routine or your mood throughout the day?\nPatient: It definitely throws off my routine\u2014I find myself pacing or fidgeting more than I\u2019d like, just trying to keep up with the stress. That kind of constant agitation wears on me, making me feel more irritable and tired as the day goes on. But honestly, I see it as a reaction to all the outside pressure rather than something wrong with me personally. It\u2019s frustrating, but it\u2019s how I\u2019m managing to keep going despite everything.\nDoctor: Given the stress you\u2019ve been under, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?\nPatient: Not really. I haven\u2019t seen any significant changes in my appetite or weight. Most of what I\u2019m dealing with seems tied to the external stress and pressure around me rather than anything physical like that. So, eating and weight have stayed about the same despite everything else.\nDoctor: How have your energy levels been lately? Do you find yourself feeling unusually tired or drained, even after getting some rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired and drained most of the time, even when I do get some rest. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the exhaustion is coming from all the outside pressure and stress piling up, not because I\u2019m doing something wrong or failing personally. It\u2019s more like my body and mind are reacting to everything I\u2019m dealing with rather than me lacking effort.\nDoctor: That kind of exhaustion, especially when it feels tied to everything you\u2019re facing, can be really wearing. It makes total sense that your body and mind are reacting this way\u2014it\u2019s not about fault or failing. How has this ongoing stress been shaping your daily life or your ability to keep up with your usual responsibilities?\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely made keeping up with daily tasks a lot harder than usual. The stress just piles on, and combined with feeling restless and tired, it\u2019s tough to stay productive or focused. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the demands from outside are constantly pushing me, making it harder to get through even simple things. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it\u2019s wearing me down.\nDoctor: It sounds really challenging to keep up when even simple tasks feel overwhelming, and that kind of strain can chip away at your mood and motivation. What specific parts of your day or tasks have been hardest lately? How are those difficulties affecting how you\u2019re feeling overall?\nPatient: The hardest part has been balancing work responsibilities with family demands. Both sides come with expectations that, honestly, feel unrealistic given everything else I have going on. It\u2019s frustrating because the constant pressure from outside wears me down and definitely drags my mood and motivation down too. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m broken or anything, but it\u2019s clear that these unfair demands are taking a real toll on how I\u2019m managing day to day.\nDoctor: Have you noticed if activities or hobbies you used to enjoy feel less interesting or rewarding lately?\nPatient: I wouldn\u2019t say they feel a lot less interesting, but the motivation to actually engage with them has definitely taken a hit. It\u2019s hard to fully get into things when there\u2019s so much pressure and stress from outside weighing on me. So, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve lost interest completely, but those external factors make it tougher to stay involved the way I want to.\nDoctor: Besides the stress and pressure, have you been feeling sad, empty, or tearful at times?\nPatient: Yeah, there are definitely times I feel down beyond just the stress. But mostly, those feelings come from the outside pressures and the way they pile up. It\u2019s frustrating and wears on me, but I wouldn\u2019t call it some deep emptiness\u2014more a reaction to everything going on around me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that with all the pressure, these feelings would come up. How often are you feeling down like this, and how strong are those feelings when they happen? Do they get in the way of your day-to-day life or your connections with people around you?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I feel down enough to notice it several days a week, but it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. When it hits, it\u2019s definitely tied to all the external stress I\u2019m dealing with. The mood does affect how I get through daily tasks and sometimes makes social stuff a bit harder, but I think that\u2019s just a natural response to the situation rather than something wrong with me personally.\nDoctor: You have a clear understanding of how these feelings connect to the stress you\u2019re facing, and it makes sense they come and go with what\u2019s happening around you. It\u2019s tough to juggle all that and keep going\u2014it\u2019s a natural response to real pressure, not a personal flaw. It\u2019s good you\u2019re noticing this pattern; it helps us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019m aware that a lot of what I\u2019m feeling is tied to the stress from outside, and it\u2019s not about some flaw or failing on my part. It\u2019s challenging, no doubt, but recognizing that connection helps me stay realistic about what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m doing what I can to keep up, even if it\u2019s tough, and knowing this isn\u2019t just me breaking down makes it a bit easier to manage.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad you have that awareness\u2014it\u2019s important. To be thorough, I need to ask: have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently?\nPatient: Occasionally, I have fleeting thoughts about death, but they\u2019re rare and don\u2019t involve any plans or intent. It feels more like a reaction to the ongoing stress and pressure outside rather than something coming from inside me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s not easy to share even rare thoughts like that, so I appreciate your honesty. Given everything you\u2019re managing, it\u2019s understandable these feelings come up. When those thoughts happen, how do you usually handle or cope with them?\nPatient: When those thoughts come up, I mostly try to keep busy or focus on tasks around me to distract myself. It\u2019s a way to manage the stress and not dwell on the feelings. Since they\u2019re rare and usually fleeting, staying occupied helps prevent them from taking hold. Again, I see it as a response to the outside pressures rather than something internal.\nDoctor: You mentioned focusing on tasks to manage stress\u2014how has your ability to concentrate and make decisions been during the day?\nPatient: Concentration and decision-making have definitely been tougher than usual. It\u2019s frustrating, but I chalk it up mostly to the stress and pressure coming from outside rather than some internal issue. I\u2019m still pushing through and trying to get things done, even if it takes more effort than before.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nConcentration and decision-making have definitely been tougher than usual.

Do they get in the way of your day-to-day life or your connections with people around you?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I feel down enough to notice it several days a week, but it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. When it hits, it\u2019s definitely tied to all the external stress I\u2019m dealing with. The mood does affect how I get through daily tasks and sometimes makes social stuff a bit harder, but I think that\u2019s just a natural response to the situation rather than something wrong with me personally.\nDoctor: You have a clear understanding of how these feelings connect to the stress you\u2019re facing, and it makes sense they come and go with what\u2019s happening around you. It\u2019s tough to juggle all that and keep going\u2014it\u2019s a natural response to real pressure, not a personal flaw. It\u2019s good you\u2019re noticing this pattern; it helps us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019m aware that a lot of what I\u2019m feeling is tied to the stress from outside, and it\u2019s not about some flaw or failing on my part. It\u2019s challenging, no doubt, but recognizing that connection helps me stay realistic about what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m doing what I can to keep up, even if it\u2019s tough, and knowing this isn\u2019t just me breaking down makes it a bit easier to manage.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad you have that awareness\u2014it\u2019s important. To be thorough, I need to ask: have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently?\nPatient: Occasionally, I have fleeting thoughts about death, but they\u2019re rare and don\u2019t involve any plans or intent. It feels more like a reaction to the ongoing stress and pressure outside rather than something coming from inside me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s not easy to share even rare thoughts like that, so I appreciate your honesty. Given everything you\u2019re managing, it\u2019s understandable these feelings come up. When those thoughts happen, how do you usually handle or cope with them?\nPatient: When those thoughts come up, I mostly try to keep busy or focus on tasks around me to distract myself. It\u2019s a way to manage the stress and not dwell on the feelings. Since they\u2019re rare and usually fleeting, staying occupied helps prevent them from taking hold. Again, I see it as a response to the outside pressures rather than something internal.\nDoctor: You mentioned focusing on tasks to manage stress\u2014how has your ability to concentrate and make decisions been during the day?\nPatient: Concentration and decision-making have definitely been tougher than usual. It\u2019s frustrating, but I chalk it up mostly to the stress and pressure coming from outside rather than some internal issue. I\u2019m still pushing through and trying to get things done, even if it takes more effort than before.\nDoctor: We touched on your sleep a bit earlier, but I want to get a clearer picture\u2014aside from waking up, have you had trouble falling asleep or stayed restless when you try to sleep?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nWe touched on your sleep a bit earlier, but I want to get a clearer picture\u2014aside from waking up, have you had trouble falling asleep or stayed restless when you try to sleep?\n\nTask:\nDecide how the patient should respond next and output JSON only.",

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I've been feeling down some of the time\u2014nothing constant, but enough to notice. Sleep has been a real challenge; I find myself restless, waking up often, and struggling to get comfortable. That restlessness also makes it harder to focus during the day, so concentrating on my work has been tougher than usual. Overall, it\u2019s been a bit draining, but I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: When you say you\u2019re waking up often, how many times a night would you say that is? And when you\u2019re awake at those times, what kinds of thoughts or feelings are running through your mind?\nPatient: I usually wake up two or three times a night. When I\u2019m awake, it\u2019s more about feeling restless and irritated\u2014nothing like deep or overwhelming thoughts, really. I think a lot of it comes from external stressors, like noise or things going on around me, rather than something internal I\u2019m turning over in my head. It just feels frustrating and keeps me from settling back down easily.\nDoctor: Have you been feeling unusually guilty about things or like you\u2019re not good enough lately?\nPatient: There are times I do feel guilty, but it\u2019s more about the circumstances I\u2019m stuck in rather than thinking I\u2019m not good enough. It\u2019s frustrating, honestly\u2014like I\u2019m being held to expectations that don\u2019t really consider what I\u2019m dealing with. So, the guilt feels tied to outside pressures, not because I\u2019m blaming myself directly.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough feeling like expectations are being piled on without recognizing what you\u2019re going through. That kind of pressure can wear down anyone\u2014what\u2019s been the hardest part about managing those outside demands right now?\nPatient: The hardest part is trying to juggle everything when the expectations don\u2019t match up with the reality I\u2019m facing. Between work, school, and family stuff, it feels like there\u2019s always more being added without any real consideration for how stretched I already am. It\u2019s frustrating and makes me pretty restless and on edge most of the time. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it feels like an unfair weight that\u2019s just not letting up.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling restless and on edge\u2014have you noticed yourself moving more than usual, like pacing or fidgeting? Or, on the flip side, feeling slowed down in your movements or thoughts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed myself moving more\u2014pacing around sometimes or fidgeting when I\u2019m stuck on something. It\u2019s more about trying to burn off some of that built-up tension from all the pressure and stress coming at me. It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m slowed down or stuck, just kind of restless from everything going on outside of me.\nDoctor: That restless energy sounds intense. How does this constant need to move or burn off tension affect your daily routine or your mood throughout the day?\nPatient: It definitely throws off my routine\u2014I find myself pacing or fidgeting more than I\u2019d like, just trying to keep up with the stress. That kind of constant agitation wears on me, making me feel more irritable and tired as the day goes on. But honestly, I see it as a reaction to all the outside pressure rather than something wrong with me personally. It\u2019s frustrating, but it\u2019s how I\u2019m managing to keep going despite everything.\nDoctor: Given the stress you\u2019ve been under, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?\nPatient: Not really. I haven\u2019t seen any significant changes in my appetite or weight. Most of what I\u2019m dealing with seems tied to the external stress and pressure around me rather than anything physical like that. So, eating and weight have stayed about the same despite everything else.\nDoctor: How have your energy levels been lately? Do you find yourself feeling unusually tired or drained, even after getting some rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired and drained most of the time, even when I do get some rest. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the exhaustion is coming from all the outside pressure and stress piling up, not because I\u2019m doing something wrong or failing personally. It\u2019s more like my body and mind are reacting to everything I\u2019m dealing with rather than me lacking effort.\nDoctor: That kind of exhaustion, especially when it feels tied to everything you\u2019re facing, can be really wearing. It makes total sense that your body and mind are reacting this way\u2014it\u2019s not about fault or failing. How has this ongoing stress been shaping your daily life or your ability to keep up with your usual responsibilities?\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely made keeping up with daily tasks a lot harder than usual. The stress just piles on, and combined with feeling restless and tired, it\u2019s tough to stay productive or focused. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the demands from outside are constantly pushing me, making it harder to get through even simple things. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it\u2019s wearing me down.\nDoctor: It sounds really challenging to keep up when even simple tasks feel overwhelming, and that kind of strain can chip away at your mood and motivation. What specific parts of your day or tasks have been hardest lately? How are those difficulties affecting how you\u2019re feeling overall?\nPatient: The hardest part has been balancing work responsibilities with family demands. Both sides come with expectations that, honestly, feel unrealistic given everything else I have going on. It\u2019s frustrating because the constant pressure from outside wears me down and definitely drags my mood and motivation down too. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m broken or anything, but it\u2019s clear that these unfair demands are taking a real toll on how I\u2019m managing day to day.\nDoctor: Have you noticed if activities or hobbies you used to enjoy feel less interesting or rewarding lately?\nPatient: I wouldn\u2019t say they feel a lot less interesting, but the motivation to actually engage with them has definitely taken a hit. It\u2019s hard to fully get into things when there\u2019s so much pressure and stress from outside weighing on me. So, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve lost interest completely, but those external factors make it tougher to stay involved the way I want to.\nDoctor: Besides the stress and pressure, have you been feeling sad, empty, or tearful at times?\nPatient: Yeah, there are definitely times I feel down beyond just the stress. But mostly, those feelings come from the outside pressures and the way they pile up. It\u2019s frustrating and wears on me, but I wouldn\u2019t call it some deep emptiness\u2014more a reaction to everything going on around me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that with all the pressure, these feelings would come up. How often are you feeling down like this, and how strong are those feelings when they happen?

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I've been feeling down some of the time\u2014nothing constant, but enough to notice. Sleep has been a real challenge; I find myself restless, waking up often, and struggling to get comfortable. That restlessness also makes it harder to focus during the day, so concentrating on my work has been tougher than usual. Overall, it\u2019s been a bit draining, but I\u2019m managing.\nDoctor: When you say you\u2019re waking up often, how many times a night would you say that is? And when you\u2019re awake at those times, what kinds of thoughts or feelings are running through your mind?\nPatient: I usually wake up two or three times a night. When I\u2019m awake, it\u2019s more about feeling restless and irritated\u2014nothing like deep or overwhelming thoughts, really. I think a lot of it comes from external stressors, like noise or things going on around me, rather than something internal I\u2019m turning over in my head. It just feels frustrating and keeps me from settling back down easily.\nDoctor: Have you been feeling unusually guilty about things or like you\u2019re not good enough lately?\nPatient: There are times I do feel guilty, but it\u2019s more about the circumstances I\u2019m stuck in rather than thinking I\u2019m not good enough. It\u2019s frustrating, honestly\u2014like I\u2019m being held to expectations that don\u2019t really consider what I\u2019m dealing with. So, the guilt feels tied to outside pressures, not because I\u2019m blaming myself directly.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough feeling like expectations are being piled on without recognizing what you\u2019re going through. That kind of pressure can wear down anyone\u2014what\u2019s been the hardest part about managing those outside demands right now?\nPatient: The hardest part is trying to juggle everything when the expectations don\u2019t match up with the reality I\u2019m facing. Between work, school, and family stuff, it feels like there\u2019s always more being added without any real consideration for how stretched I already am. It\u2019s frustrating and makes me pretty restless and on edge most of the time. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it feels like an unfair weight that\u2019s just not letting up.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling restless and on edge\u2014have you noticed yourself moving more than usual, like pacing or fidgeting? Or, on the flip side, feeling slowed down in your movements or thoughts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed myself moving more\u2014pacing around sometimes or fidgeting when I\u2019m stuck on something. It\u2019s more about trying to burn off some of that built-up tension from all the pressure and stress coming at me. It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m slowed down or stuck, just kind of restless from everything going on outside of me.\nDoctor: That restless energy sounds intense. How does this constant need to move or burn off tension affect your daily routine or your mood throughout the day?\nPatient: It definitely throws off my routine\u2014I find myself pacing or fidgeting more than I\u2019d like, just trying to keep up with the stress. That kind of constant agitation wears on me, making me feel more irritable and tired as the day goes on. But honestly, I see it as a reaction to all the outside pressure rather than something wrong with me personally. It\u2019s frustrating, but it\u2019s how I\u2019m managing to keep going despite everything.\nDoctor: Given the stress you\u2019ve been under, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?\nPatient: Not really. I haven\u2019t seen any significant changes in my appetite or weight. Most of what I\u2019m dealing with seems tied to the external stress and pressure around me rather than anything physical like that. So, eating and weight have stayed about the same despite everything else.\nDoctor: How have your energy levels been lately? Do you find yourself feeling unusually tired or drained, even after getting some rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired and drained most of the time, even when I do get some rest. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the exhaustion is coming from all the outside pressure and stress piling up, not because I\u2019m doing something wrong or failing personally. It\u2019s more like my body and mind are reacting to everything I\u2019m dealing with rather than me lacking effort.\nDoctor: That kind of exhaustion, especially when it feels tied to everything you\u2019re facing, can be really wearing. It makes total sense that your body and mind are reacting this way\u2014it\u2019s not about fault or failing. How has this ongoing stress been shaping your daily life or your ability to keep up with your usual responsibilities?\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely made keeping up with daily tasks a lot harder than usual. The stress just piles on, and combined with feeling restless and tired, it\u2019s tough to stay productive or focused. It\u2019s frustrating because it feels like the demands from outside are constantly pushing me, making it harder to get through even simple things. I\u2019m doing what I can, but it\u2019s wearing me down.\nDoctor: It sounds really challenging to keep up when even simple tasks feel overwhelming, and that kind of strain can chip away at your mood and motivation. What specific parts of your day or tasks have been hardest lately? How are those difficulties affecting how you\u2019re feeling overall?\nPatient: The hardest part has been balancing work responsibilities with family demands. Both sides come with expectations that, honestly, feel unrealistic given everything else I have going on. It\u2019s frustrating because the constant pressure from outside wears me down and definitely drags my mood and motivation down too. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m broken or anything, but it\u2019s clear that these unfair demands are taking a real toll on how I\u2019m managing day to day.\nDoctor: Have you noticed if activities or hobbies you used to enjoy feel less interesting or rewarding lately?\nPatient: I wouldn\u2019t say they feel a lot less interesting, but the motivation to actually engage with them has definitely taken a hit. It\u2019s hard to fully get into things when there\u2019s so much pressure and stress from outside weighing on me. So, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve lost interest completely, but those external factors make it tougher to stay involved the way I want to.\nDoctor: Besides the stress and pressure, have you been feeling sad, empty, or tearful at times?\nPatient: Yeah, there are definitely times I feel down beyond just the stress. But mostly, those feelings come from the outside pressures and the way they pile up. It\u2019s frustrating and wears on me, but I wouldn\u2019t call it some deep emptiness\u2014more a reaction to everything going on around me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that with all the pressure, these feelings would come up. How often are you feeling down like this, and how strong are those feelings when they happen? Do they get in the way of your day-to-day life or your connections with people around you?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I feel down enough to notice it several days a week, but it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. When it hits, it\u2019s definitely tied to all the external stress I\u2019m dealing with. The mood does affect how I get through daily tasks and sometimes makes social stuff a bit harder, but I think that\u2019s just a natural response to the situation rather than something wrong with me personally.\nDoctor: You have a clear understanding of how these feelings connect to the stress you\u2019re facing, and it makes sense they come and go with what\u2019s happening around you. It\u2019s tough to juggle all that and keep going\u2014it\u2019s a natural response to real pressure, not a personal flaw. It\u2019s good you\u2019re noticing this pattern; it helps us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019m aware that a lot of what I\u2019m feeling is tied to the stress from outside, and it\u2019s not about some flaw or failing on my part. It\u2019s challenging, no doubt, but recognizing that connection helps me stay realistic about what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m doing what I can to keep up, even if it\u2019s tough, and knowing this isn\u2019t just me breaking down makes it a bit easier to manage.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad you have that awareness\u2014it\u2019s important. To be thorough, I need to ask: have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently?\nPatient: Occasionally, I have fleeting thoughts about death, but they\u2019re rare and don\u2019t involve any plans or intent. It feels more like a reaction to the ongoing stress and pressure outside rather than something coming from inside me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s not easy to share even rare thoughts like that, so I appreciate your honesty. Given everything you\u2019re managing, it\u2019s understandable these feelings come up. When those thoughts happen, how do you usually handle or cope with them?\nPatient: When those thoughts come up, I mostly try to keep busy or focus on tasks around me to distract myself. It\u2019s a way to manage the stress and not dwell on the feelings. Since they\u2019re rare and usually fleeting, staying occupied helps prevent them from taking hold. Again, I see it as a response to the outside pressures rather than something internal.\nDoctor: You mentioned focusing on tasks to manage stress\u2014how has your ability to concentrate and make decisions been during the day?\nPatient: Concentration and decision-making have definitely been tougher than usual. It\u2019s frustrating, but I chalk it up mostly to the stress and pressure coming from outside rather than some internal issue. I\u2019m still pushing through and trying to get things done, even if it takes more effort than before.\nDoctor: We touched on your sleep a bit earlier, but I want to get a clearer picture\u2014aside from waking up, have you had trouble falling asleep or stayed restless when you try to sleep?\nPatient: Yeah, I do have trouble falling asleep sometimes. When I\u2019m trying to sleep, I often feel restless, like my mind and body just won\u2019t settle down. Most of it feels connected to the ongoing stress and noise around me, not because there\u2019s something wrong internally. It\u2019s definitely frustrating, especially when I know how important rest is.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve got a clear sense of how the stress outside is keeping you restless at night, and I can tell you\u2019re doing your best to manage through it all. It\u2019s frustrating and draining, but that insight really helps us find the right steps to support you better.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nYou\u2019ve got a clear sense of how the stress outside is keeping you restless at night, and I can tell you\u2019re doing your best to manage through it all.

Both sides come with expectations that, honestly, feel unrealistic given everything else I have going on. It\u2019s frustrating because the constant pressure from outside wears me down and definitely drags my mood and motivation down too. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m broken or anything, but it\u2019s clear that these unfair demands are taking a real toll on how I\u2019m managing day to day.\nDoctor: Have you noticed if activities or hobbies you used to enjoy feel less interesting or rewarding lately?\nPatient: I wouldn\u2019t say they feel a lot less interesting, but the motivation to actually engage with them has definitely taken a hit. It\u2019s hard to fully get into things when there\u2019s so much pressure and stress from outside weighing on me. So, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve lost interest completely, but those external factors make it tougher to stay involved the way I want to.\nDoctor: Besides the stress and pressure, have you been feeling sad, empty, or tearful at times?\nPatient: Yeah, there are definitely times I feel down beyond just the stress. But mostly, those feelings come from the outside pressures and the way they pile up. It\u2019s frustrating and wears on me, but I wouldn\u2019t call it some deep emptiness\u2014more a reaction to everything going on around me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable that with all the pressure, these feelings would come up. How often are you feeling down like this, and how strong are those feelings when they happen? Do they get in the way of your day-to-day life or your connections with people around you?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I feel down enough to notice it several days a week, but it\u2019s not constant or overwhelming. When it hits, it\u2019s definitely tied to all the external stress I\u2019m dealing with. The mood does affect how I get through daily tasks and sometimes makes social stuff a bit harder, but I think that\u2019s just a natural response to the situation rather than something wrong with me personally.\nDoctor: You have a clear understanding of how these feelings connect to the stress you\u2019re facing, and it makes sense they come and go with what\u2019s happening around you. It\u2019s tough to juggle all that and keep going\u2014it\u2019s a natural response to real pressure, not a personal flaw. It\u2019s good you\u2019re noticing this pattern; it helps us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019m aware that a lot of what I\u2019m feeling is tied to the stress from outside, and it\u2019s not about some flaw or failing on my part. It\u2019s challenging, no doubt, but recognizing that connection helps me stay realistic about what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m doing what I can to keep up, even if it\u2019s tough, and knowing this isn\u2019t just me breaking down makes it a bit easier to manage.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad you have that awareness\u2014it\u2019s important. To be thorough, I need to ask: have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently?\nPatient: Occasionally, I have fleeting thoughts about death, but they\u2019re rare and don\u2019t involve any plans or intent. It feels more like a reaction to the ongoing stress and pressure outside rather than something coming from inside me.\nDoctor: It\u2019s not easy to share even rare thoughts like that, so I appreciate your honesty. Given everything you\u2019re managing, it\u2019s understandable these feelings come up. When those thoughts happen, how do you usually handle or cope with them?\nPatient: When those thoughts come up, I mostly try to keep busy or focus on tasks around me to distract myself. It\u2019s a way to manage the stress and not dwell on the feelings. Since they\u2019re rare and usually fleeting, staying occupied helps prevent them from taking hold. Again, I see it as a response to the outside pressures rather than something internal.\nDoctor: You mentioned focusing on tasks to manage stress\u2014how has your ability to concentrate and make decisions been during the day?\nPatient: Concentration and decision-making have definitely been tougher than usual. It\u2019s frustrating, but I chalk it up mostly to the stress and pressure coming from outside rather than some internal issue. I\u2019m still pushing through and trying to get things done, even if it takes more effort than before.\nDoctor: We touched on your sleep a bit earlier, but I want to get a clearer picture\u2014aside from waking up, have you had trouble falling asleep or stayed restless when you try to sleep?\nPatient: Yeah, I do have trouble falling asleep sometimes. When I\u2019m trying to sleep, I often feel restless, like my mind and body just won\u2019t settle down. Most of it feels connected to the ongoing stress and noise around me, not because there\u2019s something wrong internally. It\u2019s definitely frustrating, especially when I know how important rest is.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve got a clear sense of how the stress outside is keeping you restless at night, and I can tell you\u2019re doing your best to manage through it all. It\u2019s frustrating and draining, but that insight really helps us find the right steps to support you better.\nPatient: I appreciate that. It\u2019s definitely a struggle, but I do keep pushing through because I don\u2019t have much choice. The restlessness and fatigue feel like direct results of the ongoing external pressures, which is frustrating since they\u2019re beyond what I can control. Still, I\u2019m doing what I can to manage and hopefully find a way forward.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
