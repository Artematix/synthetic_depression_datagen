Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

The whole situation with the job and everything else just keeps making it harder to settle down.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, Erin.

Do you find yourself feeling physically or mentally wiped out, even when you\u2019re trying to rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019m often wiped out even when I try to take it easy.

Some days the energy dips lower than others, but mostly it\u2019s just this constant low level of fatigue that doesn\u2019t really go away.\nDoctor: Got it.

It\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing this to myself; it\u2019s clearly the outside stress that\u2019s keeping me wired.\nDoctor: That constant battle with sleep combined with outside pressure sounds exhausting, Erin. With all that going on, have you noticed if things you used to enjoy or look forward to still hold any interest for you lately?\nPatient: Honestly, most things that used to interest me just don\u2019t these days.

Beyond the stress you're managing, how\u2019s your energy through the day? Do you find yourself feeling physically or mentally wiped out, even when you\u2019re trying to rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019m often wiped out even when I try to take it easy.

Some days the energy dips lower than others, but mostly it\u2019s just this constant low level of fatigue that doesn\u2019t really go away.\nDoctor: Got it. That kind of constant, low-level fatigue wears you down.

The whole situation with the job and everything else just keeps making it harder to settle down.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, Erin. When you say your sleep\u2019s been off and you\u2019re tossing and turning, how often is that happening? And how long has this been going on? I\u2019m wondering how these restless nights are affecting your days.\nPatient: It\u2019s every night, without fail, for weeks now.

It\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing this to myself; it\u2019s clearly the outside stress that\u2019s keeping me wired.\nDoctor: That constant battle with sleep combined with outside pressure sounds exhausting, Erin. With all that going on, have you noticed if things you used to enjoy or look forward to still hold any interest for you lately?\nPatient: Honestly, most things that used to interest me just don\u2019t these days. It\u2019s like the weight of everything else makes it hard to get into anything. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to, but with all the outside demands piling up, it\u2019s difficult to find any real enjoyment.\nDoctor: That loss of spark can feel heavy, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much already. How is this struggle with finding interest showing up day to day for you\u2014does it change how you feel or handle things around you?\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely draining. When things that used to keep me going don\u2019t hold any pull anymore, it zaps my energy and motivation. But the outside pressures don\u2019t give me a break\u2014they just pile on, making it harder to cope. I have to keep pushing forward even when none of it feels all that worthwhile.\nDoctor: That sounds draining, Erin\u2014the kind that seeps into both body and mind. Beyond the stress you're managing, how\u2019s your energy through the day? Do you find yourself feeling physically or mentally wiped out, even when you\u2019re trying to rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019m often wiped out even when I try to take it easy. The exhaustion\u2019s there, no doubt, and it\u2019s tied to all the outside pressures hanging over me. Some days the energy dips lower than others, but mostly it\u2019s just this constant low level of fatigue that doesn\u2019t really go away.\nDoctor: Got it. That kind of constant, low-level fatigue wears you down. Are you noticing if you feel more restless and on edge these days, or is it more like you\u2019re moving through things slower, dragging your feet more than usual?\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly restlessness and being on edge. Slowing down isn\u2019t really part of it. The outside pressures just keep ratcheting up, and it\u2019s like my mind won\u2019t quiet down.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, the nights have been rough\u2014sleep\u2019s been off, tossing and turning more than usual. It\u2019s frustrating because I can\u2019t seem to shut my mind off, like I\u2019m just restless and on edge all the time. The whole situation with the job and everything else just keeps making it harder to settle down.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, Erin. When you say your sleep\u2019s been off and you\u2019re tossing and turning, how often is that happening? And how long has this been going on? I\u2019m wondering how these restless nights are affecting your days.\nPatient: It\u2019s every night, without fail, for weeks now. I\u2019m tired most days, but there\u2019s no option to just stop \u2014 the pressures at work and everything else don\u2019t let up. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing this to myself; it\u2019s clearly the outside stress that\u2019s keeping me wired.\nDoctor: That constant battle with sleep combined with outside pressure sounds exhausting, Erin. With all that going on, have you noticed if things you used to enjoy or look forward to still hold any interest for you lately?\nPatient: Honestly, most things that used to interest me just don\u2019t these days. It\u2019s like the weight of everything else makes it hard to get into anything. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to, but with all the outside demands piling up, it\u2019s difficult to find any real enjoyment.\nDoctor: That loss of spark can feel heavy, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much already. How is this struggle with finding interest showing up day to day for you\u2014does it change how you feel or handle things around you?\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely draining. When things that used to keep me going don\u2019t hold any pull anymore, it zaps my energy and motivation. But the outside pressures don\u2019t give me a break\u2014they just pile on, making it harder to cope. I have to keep pushing forward even when none of it feels all that worthwhile.\nDoctor: That sounds draining, Erin\u2014the kind that seeps into both body and mind. Beyond the stress you're managing, how\u2019s your energy through the day? Do you find yourself feeling physically or mentally wiped out, even when you\u2019re trying to rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019m often wiped out even when I try to take it easy. The exhaustion\u2019s there, no doubt, and it\u2019s tied to all the outside pressures hanging over me. Some days the energy dips lower than others, but mostly it\u2019s just this constant low level of fatigue that doesn\u2019t really go away.\nDoctor: Got it. That kind of constant, low-level fatigue wears you down. Are you noticing if you feel more restless and on edge these days, or is it more like you\u2019re moving through things slower, dragging your feet more than usual?\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly restlessness and being on edge. Slowing down isn\u2019t really part of it. The outside pressures just keep ratcheting up, and it\u2019s like my mind won\u2019t quiet down. It\u2019s exhausting in a different way\u2014more agitation than drag.\nDoctor: That restless, on-edge feeling sounds exhausting in its own right, Erin. How do these feelings play out during your day\u2014are there certain moments or things that tend to ramp up that agitation?\nPatient: Definitely when work piles up or something unexpected hits, that\u2019s when the agitation spikes. It feels like the outside demands won\u2019t let up, and that just keeps my mind wired. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m causing to myself\u2014it\u2019s all these pressures pushing me to the edge.\nDoctor: That constant push from external pressures can leave anyone feeling stretched thin. Have you found yourself feeling down on yourself, like you\u2019re not measuring up, or maybe weighed down by guilt more than usual?\nPatient: No, I\u2019m not feeling down on myself or guilty. It\u2019s frustrating that this keeps getting framed like it\u2019s something wrong with me when it\u2019s clearly the outside pressures wearing me down.

It\u2019s frustrating because I can\u2019t seem to shut my mind off, like I\u2019m just restless and on edge all the time. The whole situation with the job and everything else just keeps making it harder to settle down.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, Erin. When you say your sleep\u2019s been off and you\u2019re tossing and turning, how often is that happening? And how long has this been going on? I\u2019m wondering how these restless nights are affecting your days.\nPatient: It\u2019s every night, without fail, for weeks now. I\u2019m tired most days, but there\u2019s no option to just stop \u2014 the pressures at work and everything else don\u2019t let up. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing this to myself; it\u2019s clearly the outside stress that\u2019s keeping me wired.\nDoctor: That constant battle with sleep combined with outside pressure sounds exhausting, Erin. With all that going on, have you noticed if things you used to enjoy or look forward to still hold any interest for you lately?\nPatient: Honestly, most things that used to interest me just don\u2019t these days. It\u2019s like the weight of everything else makes it hard to get into anything. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to, but with all the outside demands piling up, it\u2019s difficult to find any real enjoyment.\nDoctor: That loss of spark can feel heavy, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much already. How is this struggle with finding interest showing up day to day for you\u2014does it change how you feel or handle things around you?\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely draining. When things that used to keep me going don\u2019t hold any pull anymore, it zaps my energy and motivation. But the outside pressures don\u2019t give me a break\u2014they just pile on, making it harder to cope. I have to keep pushing forward even when none of it feels all that worthwhile.\nDoctor: That sounds draining, Erin\u2014the kind that seeps into both body and mind. Beyond the stress you're managing, how\u2019s your energy through the day? Do you find yourself feeling physically or mentally wiped out, even when you\u2019re trying to rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019m often wiped out even when I try to take it easy. The exhaustion\u2019s there, no doubt, and it\u2019s tied to all the outside pressures hanging over me. Some days the energy dips lower than others, but mostly it\u2019s just this constant low level of fatigue that doesn\u2019t really go away.\nDoctor: Got it. That kind of constant, low-level fatigue wears you down. Are you noticing if you feel more restless and on edge these days, or is it more like you\u2019re moving through things slower, dragging your feet more than usual?\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly restlessness and being on edge. Slowing down isn\u2019t really part of it. The outside pressures just keep ratcheting up, and it\u2019s like my mind won\u2019t quiet down. It\u2019s exhausting in a different way\u2014more agitation than drag.\nDoctor: That restless, on-edge feeling sounds exhausting in its own right, Erin. How do these feelings play out during your day\u2014are there certain moments or things that tend to ramp up that agitation?\nPatient: Definitely when work piles up or something unexpected hits, that\u2019s when the agitation spikes. It feels like the outside demands won\u2019t let up, and that just keeps my mind wired. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m causing to myself\u2014it\u2019s all these pressures pushing me to the edge.\nDoctor: That constant push from external pressures can leave anyone feeling stretched thin. Have you found yourself feeling down on yourself, like you\u2019re not measuring up, or maybe weighed down by guilt more than usual?\nPatient: No, I\u2019m not feeling down on myself or guilty. It\u2019s frustrating that this keeps getting framed like it\u2019s something wrong with me when it\u2019s clearly the outside pressures wearing me down. I\u2019m dealing with what I\u2019m dealing with because of the situation, not because I\u2019m failing.\nDoctor: I hear you, Erin\u2014it\u2019s important to recognize where the pressure\u2019s really coming from, and it\u2019s clearly not on you. Even with all that, have there been times lately when you\u2019ve felt persistently down, sad, or empty inside, despite knowing these stressors are the cause?\nPatient: Maybe once or twice, but it\u2019s rare and doesn\u2019t stick around long. It\u2019s pretty clear to me that these moments come from everything pressing in from outside, not because I\u2019m dealing with something inside myself.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense, Erin\u2014it\u2019s really tough when everything piling up outside leaves you feeling overwhelmed.

When you say your sleep\u2019s been off and you\u2019re tossing and turning, how often is that happening? And how long has this been going on? I\u2019m wondering how these restless nights are affecting your days.\nPatient: It\u2019s every night, without fail, for weeks now. I\u2019m tired most days, but there\u2019s no option to just stop \u2014 the pressures at work and everything else don\u2019t let up. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing this to myself; it\u2019s clearly the outside stress that\u2019s keeping me wired.\nDoctor: That constant battle with sleep combined with outside pressure sounds exhausting, Erin. With all that going on, have you noticed if things you used to enjoy or look forward to still hold any interest for you lately?\nPatient: Honestly, most things that used to interest me just don\u2019t these days. It\u2019s like the weight of everything else makes it hard to get into anything. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to, but with all the outside demands piling up, it\u2019s difficult to find any real enjoyment.\nDoctor: That loss of spark can feel heavy, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much already. How is this struggle with finding interest showing up day to day for you\u2014does it change how you feel or handle things around you?\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely draining. When things that used to keep me going don\u2019t hold any pull anymore, it zaps my energy and motivation. But the outside pressures don\u2019t give me a break\u2014they just pile on, making it harder to cope. I have to keep pushing forward even when none of it feels all that worthwhile.\nDoctor: That sounds draining, Erin\u2014the kind that seeps into both body and mind. Beyond the stress you're managing, how\u2019s your energy through the day? Do you find yourself feeling physically or mentally wiped out, even when you\u2019re trying to rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019m often wiped out even when I try to take it easy. The exhaustion\u2019s there, no doubt, and it\u2019s tied to all the outside pressures hanging over me. Some days the energy dips lower than others, but mostly it\u2019s just this constant low level of fatigue that doesn\u2019t really go away.\nDoctor: Got it. That kind of constant, low-level fatigue wears you down. Are you noticing if you feel more restless and on edge these days, or is it more like you\u2019re moving through things slower, dragging your feet more than usual?\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly restlessness and being on edge. Slowing down isn\u2019t really part of it. The outside pressures just keep ratcheting up, and it\u2019s like my mind won\u2019t quiet down. It\u2019s exhausting in a different way\u2014more agitation than drag.\nDoctor: That restless, on-edge feeling sounds exhausting in its own right, Erin. How do these feelings play out during your day\u2014are there certain moments or things that tend to ramp up that agitation?\nPatient: Definitely when work piles up or something unexpected hits, that\u2019s when the agitation spikes. It feels like the outside demands won\u2019t let up, and that just keeps my mind wired. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m causing to myself\u2014it\u2019s all these pressures pushing me to the edge.\nDoctor: That constant push from external pressures can leave anyone feeling stretched thin. Have you found yourself feeling down on yourself, like you\u2019re not measuring up, or maybe weighed down by guilt more than usual?\nPatient: No, I\u2019m not feeling down on myself or guilty. It\u2019s frustrating that this keeps getting framed like it\u2019s something wrong with me when it\u2019s clearly the outside pressures wearing me down.

It\u2019s exhausting in a different way\u2014more agitation than drag.\nDoctor: That restless, on-edge feeling sounds exhausting in its own right, Erin. How do these feelings play out during your day\u2014are there certain moments or things that tend to ramp up that agitation?\nPatient: Definitely when work piles up or something unexpected hits, that\u2019s when the agitation spikes. It feels like the outside demands won\u2019t let up, and that just keeps my mind wired. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m causing to myself\u2014it\u2019s all these pressures pushing me to the edge.\nDoctor: That constant push from external pressures can leave anyone feeling stretched thin. Have you found yourself feeling down on yourself, like you\u2019re not measuring up, or maybe weighed down by guilt more than usual?\nPatient: No, I\u2019m not feeling down on myself or guilty. It\u2019s frustrating that this keeps getting framed like it\u2019s something wrong with me when it\u2019s clearly the outside pressures wearing me down. I\u2019m dealing with what I\u2019m dealing with because of the situation, not because I\u2019m failing.\nDoctor: I hear you, Erin\u2014it\u2019s important to recognize where the pressure\u2019s really coming from, and it\u2019s clearly not on you. Even with all that, have there been times lately when you\u2019ve felt persistently down, sad, or empty inside, despite knowing these stressors are the cause?\nPatient: Maybe once or twice, but it\u2019s rare and doesn\u2019t stick around long. It\u2019s pretty clear to me that these moments come from everything pressing in from outside, not because I\u2019m dealing with something inside myself.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense, Erin\u2014it\u2019s really tough when everything piling up outside leaves you feeling overwhelmed. Your insight that it\u2019s the weight of those pressures, and not something internal fault, shows you\u2019re being really clear-eyed about what\u2019s happening, even if it\u2019s messy and complex emotionally.\nPatient: Thanks. I appreciate you seeing it that way. It\u2019s definitely the outside stuff causing all this\u2014no need to look for problems inside myself when the pressures are already enough to handle.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad that resonates with you, Erin. To get a clearer picture of your sleep, can you walk me through what your nights look like\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you'd like?\nPatient: I usually lie awake for a while with my mind racing before I even fall asleep. Then I tend to wake up several times during the night. It\u2019s not like this is something I\u2019m doing to myself\u2014it's the external stress that keeps my brain from shutting down.\nDoctor: That kind of night-sabotaging mind noise can really take a toll. Have you noticed any big changes in your appetite or weight lately? It can give us another piece of the puzzle about how all this stress and mood is hitting you physically.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat kind of night-sabotaging mind noise can really take a toll.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, the nights have been rough\u2014sleep\u2019s been off, tossing and turning more than usual. It\u2019s frustrating because I can\u2019t seem to shut my mind off, like I\u2019m just restless and on edge all the time. The whole situation with the job and everything else just keeps making it harder to settle down.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, Erin. When you say your sleep\u2019s been off and you\u2019re tossing and turning, how often is that happening? And how long has this been going on? I\u2019m wondering how these restless nights are affecting your days.\nPatient: It\u2019s every night, without fail, for weeks now. I\u2019m tired most days, but there\u2019s no option to just stop \u2014 the pressures at work and everything else don\u2019t let up. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing this to myself; it\u2019s clearly the outside stress that\u2019s keeping me wired.\nDoctor: That constant battle with sleep combined with outside pressure sounds exhausting, Erin. With all that going on, have you noticed if things you used to enjoy or look forward to still hold any interest for you lately?\nPatient: Honestly, most things that used to interest me just don\u2019t these days. It\u2019s like the weight of everything else makes it hard to get into anything. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to, but with all the outside demands piling up, it\u2019s difficult to find any real enjoyment.\nDoctor: That loss of spark can feel heavy, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much already. How is this struggle with finding interest showing up day to day for you\u2014does it change how you feel or handle things around you?\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely draining. When things that used to keep me going don\u2019t hold any pull anymore, it zaps my energy and motivation. But the outside pressures don\u2019t give me a break\u2014they just pile on, making it harder to cope. I have to keep pushing forward even when none of it feels all that worthwhile.\nDoctor: That sounds draining, Erin\u2014the kind that seeps into both body and mind. Beyond the stress you're managing, how\u2019s your energy through the day? Do you find yourself feeling physically or mentally wiped out, even when you\u2019re trying to rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019m often wiped out even when I try to take it easy. The exhaustion\u2019s there, no doubt, and it\u2019s tied to all the outside pressures hanging over me. Some days the energy dips lower than others, but mostly it\u2019s just this constant low level of fatigue that doesn\u2019t really go away.\nDoctor: Got it. That kind of constant, low-level fatigue wears you down. Are you noticing if you feel more restless and on edge these days, or is it more like you\u2019re moving through things slower, dragging your feet more than usual?\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly restlessness and being on edge. Slowing down isn\u2019t really part of it. The outside pressures just keep ratcheting up, and it\u2019s like my mind won\u2019t quiet down.

The whole situation with the job and everything else just keeps making it harder to settle down.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, Erin. When you say your sleep\u2019s been off and you\u2019re tossing and turning, how often is that happening? And how long has this been going on? I\u2019m wondering how these restless nights are affecting your days.\nPatient: It\u2019s every night, without fail, for weeks now. I\u2019m tired most days, but there\u2019s no option to just stop \u2014 the pressures at work and everything else don\u2019t let up. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing this to myself; it\u2019s clearly the outside stress that\u2019s keeping me wired.\nDoctor: That constant battle with sleep combined with outside pressure sounds exhausting, Erin. With all that going on, have you noticed if things you used to enjoy or look forward to still hold any interest for you lately?\nPatient: Honestly, most things that used to interest me just don\u2019t these days. It\u2019s like the weight of everything else makes it hard to get into anything. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to, but with all the outside demands piling up, it\u2019s difficult to find any real enjoyment.\nDoctor: That loss of spark can feel heavy, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much already. How is this struggle with finding interest showing up day to day for you\u2014does it change how you feel or handle things around you?\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely draining. When things that used to keep me going don\u2019t hold any pull anymore, it zaps my energy and motivation. But the outside pressures don\u2019t give me a break\u2014they just pile on, making it harder to cope. I have to keep pushing forward even when none of it feels all that worthwhile.\nDoctor: That sounds draining, Erin\u2014the kind that seeps into both body and mind. Beyond the stress you're managing, how\u2019s your energy through the day? Do you find yourself feeling physically or mentally wiped out, even when you\u2019re trying to rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019m often wiped out even when I try to take it easy. The exhaustion\u2019s there, no doubt, and it\u2019s tied to all the outside pressures hanging over me. Some days the energy dips lower than others, but mostly it\u2019s just this constant low level of fatigue that doesn\u2019t really go away.\nDoctor: Got it. That kind of constant, low-level fatigue wears you down. Are you noticing if you feel more restless and on edge these days, or is it more like you\u2019re moving through things slower, dragging your feet more than usual?\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly restlessness and being on edge. Slowing down isn\u2019t really part of it. The outside pressures just keep ratcheting up, and it\u2019s like my mind won\u2019t quiet down. It\u2019s exhausting in a different way\u2014more agitation than drag.\nDoctor: That restless, on-edge feeling sounds exhausting in its own right, Erin. How do these feelings play out during your day\u2014are there certain moments or things that tend to ramp up that agitation?\nPatient: Definitely when work piles up or something unexpected hits, that\u2019s when the agitation spikes. It feels like the outside demands won\u2019t let up, and that just keeps my mind wired. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m causing to myself\u2014it\u2019s all these pressures pushing me to the edge.\nDoctor: That constant push from external pressures can leave anyone feeling stretched thin. Have you found yourself feeling down on yourself, like you\u2019re not measuring up, or maybe weighed down by guilt more than usual?\nPatient: No, I\u2019m not feeling down on myself or guilty. It\u2019s frustrating that this keeps getting framed like it\u2019s something wrong with me when it\u2019s clearly the outside pressures wearing me down. I\u2019m dealing with what I\u2019m dealing with because of the situation, not because I\u2019m failing.\nDoctor: I hear you, Erin\u2014it\u2019s important to recognize where the pressure\u2019s really coming from, and it\u2019s clearly not on you. Even with all that, have there been times lately when you\u2019ve felt persistently down, sad, or empty inside, despite knowing these stressors are the cause?\nPatient: Maybe once or twice, but it\u2019s rare and doesn\u2019t stick around long. It\u2019s pretty clear to me that these moments come from everything pressing in from outside, not because I\u2019m dealing with something inside myself.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense, Erin\u2014it\u2019s really tough when everything piling up outside leaves you feeling overwhelmed. Your insight that it\u2019s the weight of those pressures, and not something internal fault, shows you\u2019re being really clear-eyed about what\u2019s happening, even if it\u2019s messy and complex emotionally.\nPatient: Thanks. I appreciate you seeing it that way. It\u2019s definitely the outside stuff causing all this\u2014no need to look for problems inside myself when the pressures are already enough to handle.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad that resonates with you, Erin. To get a clearer picture of your sleep, can you walk me through what your nights look like\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you'd like?\nPatient: I usually lie awake for a while with my mind racing before I even fall asleep. Then I tend to wake up several times during the night. It\u2019s not like this is something I\u2019m doing to myself\u2014it's the external stress that keeps my brain from shutting down.\nDoctor: That kind of night-sabotaging mind noise can really take a toll. Have you noticed any big changes in your appetite or weight lately? It can give us another piece of the puzzle about how all this stress and mood is hitting you physically.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed my appetite\u2019s been off, not really feeling hungry like before. That\u2019s led to some weight changes too. It\u2019s just part of the fallout from everything external pressing down on me\u2014not like it\u2019s something I can turn around easily.\nDoctor: That disruption in appetite makes perfect sense given what you\u2019re dealing with. How much weight would you say you\u2019ve lost or gained? And how are these appetite changes affecting your daily meals and energy levels? I\u2019m interested in how it\u2019s feeling for you, both physically and emotionally.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat disruption in appetite makes perfect sense given what you\u2019re dealing with.

I\u2019m wondering how these restless nights are affecting your days.\nPatient: It\u2019s every night, without fail, for weeks now. I\u2019m tired most days, but there\u2019s no option to just stop \u2014 the pressures at work and everything else don\u2019t let up. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing this to myself; it\u2019s clearly the outside stress that\u2019s keeping me wired.\nDoctor: That constant battle with sleep combined with outside pressure sounds exhausting, Erin. With all that going on, have you noticed if things you used to enjoy or look forward to still hold any interest for you lately?\nPatient: Honestly, most things that used to interest me just don\u2019t these days. It\u2019s like the weight of everything else makes it hard to get into anything. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to, but with all the outside demands piling up, it\u2019s difficult to find any real enjoyment.\nDoctor: That loss of spark can feel heavy, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much already. How is this struggle with finding interest showing up day to day for you\u2014does it change how you feel or handle things around you?\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely draining. When things that used to keep me going don\u2019t hold any pull anymore, it zaps my energy and motivation. But the outside pressures don\u2019t give me a break\u2014they just pile on, making it harder to cope. I have to keep pushing forward even when none of it feels all that worthwhile.\nDoctor: That sounds draining, Erin\u2014the kind that seeps into both body and mind. Beyond the stress you're managing, how\u2019s your energy through the day? Do you find yourself feeling physically or mentally wiped out, even when you\u2019re trying to rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019m often wiped out even when I try to take it easy. The exhaustion\u2019s there, no doubt, and it\u2019s tied to all the outside pressures hanging over me. Some days the energy dips lower than others, but mostly it\u2019s just this constant low level of fatigue that doesn\u2019t really go away.\nDoctor: Got it. That kind of constant, low-level fatigue wears you down. Are you noticing if you feel more restless and on edge these days, or is it more like you\u2019re moving through things slower, dragging your feet more than usual?\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly restlessness and being on edge. Slowing down isn\u2019t really part of it. The outside pressures just keep ratcheting up, and it\u2019s like my mind won\u2019t quiet down. It\u2019s exhausting in a different way\u2014more agitation than drag.\nDoctor: That restless, on-edge feeling sounds exhausting in its own right, Erin. How do these feelings play out during your day\u2014are there certain moments or things that tend to ramp up that agitation?\nPatient: Definitely when work piles up or something unexpected hits, that\u2019s when the agitation spikes. It feels like the outside demands won\u2019t let up, and that just keeps my mind wired. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m causing to myself\u2014it\u2019s all these pressures pushing me to the edge.\nDoctor: That constant push from external pressures can leave anyone feeling stretched thin. Have you found yourself feeling down on yourself, like you\u2019re not measuring up, or maybe weighed down by guilt more than usual?\nPatient: No, I\u2019m not feeling down on myself or guilty. It\u2019s frustrating that this keeps getting framed like it\u2019s something wrong with me when it\u2019s clearly the outside pressures wearing me down. I\u2019m dealing with what I\u2019m dealing with because of the situation, not because I\u2019m failing.\nDoctor: I hear you, Erin\u2014it\u2019s important to recognize where the pressure\u2019s really coming from, and it\u2019s clearly not on you. Even with all that, have there been times lately when you\u2019ve felt persistently down, sad, or empty inside, despite knowing these stressors are the cause?\nPatient: Maybe once or twice, but it\u2019s rare and doesn\u2019t stick around long. It\u2019s pretty clear to me that these moments come from everything pressing in from outside, not because I\u2019m dealing with something inside myself.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense, Erin\u2014it\u2019s really tough when everything piling up outside leaves you feeling overwhelmed.

To get a clearer picture of your sleep, can you walk me through what your nights look like\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you'd like?\nPatient: I usually lie awake for a while with my mind racing before I even fall asleep. Then I tend to wake up several times during the night. It\u2019s not like this is something I\u2019m doing to myself\u2014it's the external stress that keeps my brain from shutting down.\nDoctor: That kind of night-sabotaging mind noise can really take a toll. Have you noticed any big changes in your appetite or weight lately? It can give us another piece of the puzzle about how all this stress and mood is hitting you physically.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed my appetite\u2019s been off, not really feeling hungry like before. That\u2019s led to some weight changes too. It\u2019s just part of the fallout from everything external pressing down on me\u2014not like it\u2019s something I can turn around easily.\nDoctor: That disruption in appetite makes perfect sense given what you\u2019re dealing with. How much weight would you say you\u2019ve lost or gained? And how are these appetite changes affecting your daily meals and energy levels? I\u2019m interested in how it\u2019s feeling for you, both physically and emotionally.\nPatient: I\u2019ve lost a bit of weight\u2014enough to notice.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, the nights have been rough\u2014sleep\u2019s been off, tossing and turning more than usual. It\u2019s frustrating because I can\u2019t seem to shut my mind off, like I\u2019m just restless and on edge all the time. The whole situation with the job and everything else just keeps making it harder to settle down.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, Erin. When you say your sleep\u2019s been off and you\u2019re tossing and turning, how often is that happening? And how long has this been going on? I\u2019m wondering how these restless nights are affecting your days.\nPatient: It\u2019s every night, without fail, for weeks now. I\u2019m tired most days, but there\u2019s no option to just stop \u2014 the pressures at work and everything else don\u2019t let up. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing this to myself; it\u2019s clearly the outside stress that\u2019s keeping me wired.\nDoctor: That constant battle with sleep combined with outside pressure sounds exhausting, Erin. With all that going on, have you noticed if things you used to enjoy or look forward to still hold any interest for you lately?\nPatient: Honestly, most things that used to interest me just don\u2019t these days. It\u2019s like the weight of everything else makes it hard to get into anything. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to, but with all the outside demands piling up, it\u2019s difficult to find any real enjoyment.\nDoctor: That loss of spark can feel heavy, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much already. How is this struggle with finding interest showing up day to day for you\u2014does it change how you feel or handle things around you?\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely draining. When things that used to keep me going don\u2019t hold any pull anymore, it zaps my energy and motivation. But the outside pressures don\u2019t give me a break\u2014they just pile on, making it harder to cope. I have to keep pushing forward even when none of it feels all that worthwhile.\nDoctor: That sounds draining, Erin\u2014the kind that seeps into both body and mind. Beyond the stress you're managing, how\u2019s your energy through the day? Do you find yourself feeling physically or mentally wiped out, even when you\u2019re trying to rest?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019m often wiped out even when I try to take it easy. The exhaustion\u2019s there, no doubt, and it\u2019s tied to all the outside pressures hanging over me. Some days the energy dips lower than others, but mostly it\u2019s just this constant low level of fatigue that doesn\u2019t really go away.\nDoctor: Got it. That kind of constant, low-level fatigue wears you down. Are you noticing if you feel more restless and on edge these days, or is it more like you\u2019re moving through things slower, dragging your feet more than usual?\nPatient: It\u2019s mostly restlessness and being on edge. Slowing down isn\u2019t really part of it. The outside pressures just keep ratcheting up, and it\u2019s like my mind won\u2019t quiet down. It\u2019s exhausting in a different way\u2014more agitation than drag.\nDoctor: That restless, on-edge feeling sounds exhausting in its own right, Erin. How do these feelings play out during your day\u2014are there certain moments or things that tend to ramp up that agitation?\nPatient: Definitely when work piles up or something unexpected hits, that\u2019s when the agitation spikes. It feels like the outside demands won\u2019t let up, and that just keeps my mind wired. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m causing to myself\u2014it\u2019s all these pressures pushing me to the edge.\nDoctor: That constant push from external pressures can leave anyone feeling stretched thin. Have you found yourself feeling down on yourself, like you\u2019re not measuring up, or maybe weighed down by guilt more than usual?\nPatient: No, I\u2019m not feeling down on myself or guilty. It\u2019s frustrating that this keeps getting framed like it\u2019s something wrong with me when it\u2019s clearly the outside pressures wearing me down. I\u2019m dealing with what I\u2019m dealing with because of the situation, not because I\u2019m failing.\nDoctor: I hear you, Erin\u2014it\u2019s important to recognize where the pressure\u2019s really coming from, and it\u2019s clearly not on you. Even with all that, have there been times lately when you\u2019ve felt persistently down, sad, or empty inside, despite knowing these stressors are the cause?\nPatient: Maybe once or twice, but it\u2019s rare and doesn\u2019t stick around long. It\u2019s pretty clear to me that these moments come from everything pressing in from outside, not because I\u2019m dealing with something inside myself.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense, Erin\u2014it\u2019s really tough when everything piling up outside leaves you feeling overwhelmed. Your insight that it\u2019s the weight of those pressures, and not something internal fault, shows you\u2019re being really clear-eyed about what\u2019s happening, even if it\u2019s messy and complex emotionally.\nPatient: Thanks. I appreciate you seeing it that way. It\u2019s definitely the outside stuff causing all this\u2014no need to look for problems inside myself when the pressures are already enough to handle.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad that resonates with you, Erin. To get a clearer picture of your sleep, can you walk me through what your nights look like\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you'd like?\nPatient: I usually lie awake for a while with my mind racing before I even fall asleep. Then I tend to wake up several times during the night. It\u2019s not like this is something I\u2019m doing to myself\u2014it's the external stress that keeps my brain from shutting down.\nDoctor: That kind of night-sabotaging mind noise can really take a toll. Have you noticed any big changes in your appetite or weight lately? It can give us another piece of the puzzle about how all this stress and mood is hitting you physically.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed my appetite\u2019s been off, not really feeling hungry like before. That\u2019s led to some weight changes too. It\u2019s just part of the fallout from everything external pressing down on me\u2014not like it\u2019s something I can turn around easily.\nDoctor: That disruption in appetite makes perfect sense given what you\u2019re dealing with. How much weight would you say you\u2019ve lost or gained? And how are these appetite changes affecting your daily meals and energy levels? I\u2019m interested in how it\u2019s feeling for you, both physically and emotionally.\nPatient: I\u2019ve lost a bit of weight\u2014enough to notice. My appetite\u2019s been lower, and meals aren\u2019t as regular as they used to be. It\u2019s all because of the stress and pressure around me, not because of anything else. The energy dips are just another result of that.\nDoctor: Noticing those changes is important, Erin. With all this stress and the fatigue you\u2019ve described, have you been having a harder time concentrating or making decisions than usual?\nPatient: No, concentration and decisions aren\u2019t really a problem. That\u2019s not what\u2019s causing any of this\u2014it\u2019s all about the external stress.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Erin. Before we wrap up, I want to check in on something important\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide lately? It\u2019s a tough topic, but it helps to know so we can support you safely.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nI appreciate you clarifying that, Erin.

I\u2019m dealing with what I\u2019m dealing with because of the situation, not because I\u2019m failing.\nDoctor: I hear you, Erin\u2014it\u2019s important to recognize where the pressure\u2019s really coming from, and it\u2019s clearly not on you. Even with all that, have there been times lately when you\u2019ve felt persistently down, sad, or empty inside, despite knowing these stressors are the cause?\nPatient: Maybe once or twice, but it\u2019s rare and doesn\u2019t stick around long. It\u2019s pretty clear to me that these moments come from everything pressing in from outside, not because I\u2019m dealing with something inside myself.\nDoctor: That makes a lot of sense, Erin\u2014it\u2019s really tough when everything piling up outside leaves you feeling overwhelmed. Your insight that it\u2019s the weight of those pressures, and not something internal fault, shows you\u2019re being really clear-eyed about what\u2019s happening, even if it\u2019s messy and complex emotionally.\nPatient: Thanks. I appreciate you seeing it that way. It\u2019s definitely the outside stuff causing all this\u2014no need to look for problems inside myself when the pressures are already enough to handle.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad that resonates with you, Erin. To get a clearer picture of your sleep, can you walk me through what your nights look like\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you'd like?\nPatient: I usually lie awake for a while with my mind racing before I even fall asleep. Then I tend to wake up several times during the night. It\u2019s not like this is something I\u2019m doing to myself\u2014it's the external stress that keeps my brain from shutting down.\nDoctor: That kind of night-sabotaging mind noise can really take a toll. Have you noticed any big changes in your appetite or weight lately? It can give us another piece of the puzzle about how all this stress and mood is hitting you physically.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed my appetite\u2019s been off, not really feeling hungry like before. That\u2019s led to some weight changes too. It\u2019s just part of the fallout from everything external pressing down on me\u2014not like it\u2019s something I can turn around easily.\nDoctor: That disruption in appetite makes perfect sense given what you\u2019re dealing with. How much weight would you say you\u2019ve lost or gained? And how are these appetite changes affecting your daily meals and energy levels? I\u2019m interested in how it\u2019s feeling for you, both physically and emotionally.\nPatient: I\u2019ve lost a bit of weight\u2014enough to notice. My appetite\u2019s been lower, and meals aren\u2019t as regular as they used to be. It\u2019s all because of the stress and pressure around me, not because of anything else. The energy dips are just another result of that.\nDoctor: Noticing those changes is important, Erin. With all this stress and the fatigue you\u2019ve described, have you been having a harder time concentrating or making decisions than usual?\nPatient: No, concentration and decisions aren\u2019t really a problem. That\u2019s not what\u2019s causing any of this\u2014it\u2019s all about the external stress.\nDoctor: I appreciate you clarifying that, Erin. Before we wrap up, I want to check in on something important\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide lately? It\u2019s a tough topic, but it helps to know so we can support you safely.\nPatient: Very rarely, and only briefly when the pressure feels like too much. It\u2019s clearly from all the stress outside, not because there\u2019s something wrong inside me.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
