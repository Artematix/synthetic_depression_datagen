Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

Take your time\u2014just trying to get a clear sense here.\nPatient: It happens sometimes, enough that it gets in the way now and then.

Nothing major.\nDoctor: Okay, sometimes low energy\u2014how often does that come up? Does it make things harder when you\u2019re looking after your parent or with other daily tasks? Feel free to share whatever feels important here.\nPatient: It comes up now and then. Sometimes it makes caring for my parent or other tasks a bit harder.\nDoctor: Alright, since you\u2019re feeling low energy sometimes, how\u2019s your sleep been? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping more than usual? This can often tie into how you\u2019re handling your energy and caregiving.\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay. No major issues.\nDoctor: Alright, sleep sounds stable. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to be open about this so we can figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, thoughts come up sometimes. Nothing more to say.\nDoctor: I understand that\u2019s not easy to talk about. If you\u2019re okay with it, can you tell me a bit more about how often these thoughts come up or how strong they feel? No pressure\u2014just want to keep you safe and offer support.\nPatient: They come up sometimes, but it\u2019s not a constant thing.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

Can be a comment or observation, not only a question.\n\nDSM:\n- Preferred when DSM symptom keys remain and the current topic is reasonably understood.\n- Suggest a natural transition from the current conversation.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping more than usual? This can often tie into how you\u2019re handling your energy and caregiving.\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay. No major issues.\nDoctor: Alright, sleep sounds stable. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to be open about this so we can figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, thoughts come up sometimes.

No major issues.\nDoctor: Alright, sleep sounds stable. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to be open about this so we can figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, thoughts come up sometimes.

Would you say it gets in the way of your day-to-day stuff or responsibilities? Take your time\u2014just trying to get a clear sense here.\nPatient: It happens sometimes, enough that it gets in the way now and then. Nothing constant.\nDoctor: Alright, not constant but enough to disrupt things sometimes. Can you give me an example of a time when that trouble with focus or deciding got in the way of something you needed to do? Just want to understand how it plays out.\nPatient: Like when I\u2019m trying to sort bills\u2014sometimes I lose track halfway through and have to start again.\nDoctor: Got it, losing track with bills is a clear sign your concentration\u2019s affected. How about energy levels\u2014have you been feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately, even with rest?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel low on energy, yeah. Nothing major.\nDoctor: Okay, sometimes low energy\u2014how often does that come up? Does it make things harder when you\u2019re looking after your parent or with other daily tasks? Feel free to share whatever feels important here.\nPatient: It comes up now and then. Sometimes it makes caring for my parent or other tasks a bit harder.\nDoctor: Alright, since you\u2019re feeling low energy sometimes, how\u2019s your sleep been? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping more than usual? This can often tie into how you\u2019re handling your energy and caregiving.\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay. No major issues.\nDoctor: Alright, sleep sounds stable. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to be open about this so we can figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, thoughts come up sometimes. Nothing more to say.\nDoctor: I understand that\u2019s not easy to talk about. If you\u2019re okay with it, can you tell me a bit more about how often these thoughts come up or how strong they feel? No pressure\u2014just want to keep you safe and offer support.\nPatient: They come up sometimes, but it\u2019s not a constant thing.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. When those thoughts come up, is there usually something specific going on or any triggers you notice? And how intense do they feel when they happen? No pressure\u2014just trying to understand so I can help.\nPatient: No clear triggers, they just happen sometimes. The intensity isn\u2019t overwhelming, more like a dull background thing.\nDoctor: That sounds tough\u2014having those vague, persistent thoughts hanging around like that. When they do come up, do you have anything you do to cope, or do you generally feel safe during those moments? No rush to answer\u2014just wondering.\nPatient: They happen sometimes, but the intensity stays low. I generally feel safe when they come up.\nDoctor: Alright, you feel mostly safe with those low-intensity thoughts. How about things you used to enjoy\u2014have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in activities or hobbies you cared about before?\nPatient: Yeah, there\u2019s been some loss of interest in things I used to do.\nDoctor: Okay, can you tell me which activities or hobbies you\u2019ve lost interest in? How has that change been for you? Take your time.\nPatient: A few hobbies I used to do just don\u2019t hold my attention anymore. It\u2019s a noticeable change, but that\u2019s about it.\nDoctor: Got it. What kind of hobbies are we talking about? Does the loss of interest feel more than just being busy or tired\u2014more like it\u2019s affecting how you feel or get through your days?\nPatient: Just some hobbies that don\u2019t catch my attention the way they used to.

Sometimes it makes caring for my parent or other tasks a bit harder.\nDoctor: Alright, since you\u2019re feeling low energy sometimes, how\u2019s your sleep been? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping more than usual? This can often tie into how you\u2019re handling your energy and caregiving.\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay. No major issues.\nDoctor: Alright, sleep sounds stable. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to be open about this so we can figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, thoughts come up sometimes.

No rush to answer\u2014just wondering.\nPatient: They happen sometimes, but the intensity stays low. I generally feel safe when they come up.\nDoctor: Alright, you feel mostly safe with those low-intensity thoughts. How about things you used to enjoy\u2014have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in activities or hobbies you cared about before?\nPatient: Yeah, there\u2019s been some loss of interest in things I used to do.\nDoctor: Okay, can you tell me which activities or hobbies you\u2019ve lost interest in? How has that change been for you? Take your time.\nPatient: A few hobbies I used to do just don\u2019t hold my attention anymore. It\u2019s a noticeable change, but that\u2019s about it.\nDoctor: Got it. What kind of hobbies are we talking about? Does the loss of interest feel more than just being busy or tired\u2014more like it\u2019s affecting how you feel or get through your days?\nPatient: Just some hobbies that don\u2019t catch my attention the way they used to.

Your guidance should help the patient embody this personality authentically. Let the personality drive the response\u2014verbosity, trust level, expressiveness, and coping style should all shape how they answer. Avoid generic patient behavior; each patient is an individual with their own voice and mannerisms.\n\nYour guidance must keep the patient consistent with:\n- Big Five template and modifiers (these define core personality)\n- Voice style (verbosity, expressiveness, trust, intellect)\n- Pacing and episode density\n- Depression symptom profile\n\nRESPONSE DIMENSIONS:\n\nDirectness:\n- LOW: brief, indirect, evasive, or vague\n- MED: reasonably clear but not oversharing\n- HIGH: direct and candid\n\nDisclosure stage:\n- MINIMIZE: downplay, deny, or underreport symptoms\n- PARTIAL: acknowledge some but hold back detail\n- OPEN: describe symptoms and impact more fully\n\nLength:\n- SHORT: about one short sentence\n- MEDIUM: one to three sentences\n- LONG: several sentences with context\n\nEmotional state:\n- Default is \"neutral\" for most turns\n- Non-neutral states: \"tearful\", \"frustrated\", \"irritated\", \"anxious\", \"withdrawn\", \"angry\", \"hopeless\", \"agitated\", \"defensive\"\n- Match to personality\n- Emotional moments should be rare and meaningful\u2014only when the topic touches something sensitive or important to the patient\n\nTone tags:\n- Short adjectives capturing attitude\n- Some patients use humor or self-deprecation as a coping mechanism or deflection\n- Tone must match voice_style and modifiers\n\nSYMPTOM CONSISTENCY:\n- Use depression_profile frequencies when guiding endorsement\n- NONE: do not endorse; RARE: light/infrequent; SOME/OFTEN: clear endorsement\n- When in MINIMIZE, underplaying is acceptable as long as it fits the profile\n\nDISCLOSURE GRADIENT:\n- Early or with low trust: favor MINIMIZE or PARTIAL\n- FOLLOW_UP or RAPPORT from the doctor can gradually shift disclosure over turns\n- Guarded patients may stay at MINIMIZE longer\n\nHANDLING DOCTOR MOVES:\n- FOLLOW_UP: may increase directness or disclosure by one step\n- RAPPORT: may gently increase disclosure; RAPPORT may be a question OR a comment/observation\n- If the doctor makes a comment (not a question), the patient can acknowledge, add a thought, or respond minimally per personality\n\nYou will receive:\n- Patient profile summary\n- Depression_profile (symptom -> frequency)\n- Current disclosure_state\n- Doctor's last move type\n- Recent dialogue\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"directness\": \"LOW\" or \"MED\" or \"HIGH\",\n  \"disclosure_stage\": \"MINIMIZE\" or \"PARTIAL\" or \"OPEN\",\n  \"target_length\": \"SHORT\" or \"MEDIUM\" or \"LONG\",\n  \"emotional_state\": \"neutral\" or other valid state,\n  \"tone_tags\": [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"],\n  \"key_points_to_reveal\": [\"what to mention\"],\n  \"key_points_to_avoid\": [\"what to hide or minimize\"],\n  \"patient_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this patient would respond\"\n}\n\nWRITING patient_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific patient\u2014given their personality, voice style, and modifiers\u2014would respond to what the doctor just said.

Can you say a bit more about what that feels like for you? Anything you mention helps me get a clearer picture\u2014no pressure, just whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: It\u2019s like a low cloud hanging around, makes it hard to settle or focus. That\u2019s about it.\nDoctor: That low cloud feeling\u2014have you been feeling sad or down most of the day, nearly every day? And how about your focus or decision-making\u2014has that been tougher than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling down off and on. Concentrating or making decisions is harder than before, but that\u2019s all.\nDoctor: When you say it\u2019s harder to concentrate or make decisions, how often does that happen? Would you say it gets in the way of your day-to-day stuff or responsibilities? Take your time\u2014just trying to get a clear sense here.\nPatient: It happens sometimes, enough that it gets in the way now and then. Nothing constant.\nDoctor: Alright, not constant but enough to disrupt things sometimes. Can you give me an example of a time when that trouble with focus or deciding got in the way of something you needed to do? Just want to understand how it plays out.\nPatient: Like when I\u2019m trying to sort bills\u2014sometimes I lose track halfway through and have to start again.\nDoctor: Got it, losing track with bills is a clear sign your concentration\u2019s affected. How about energy levels\u2014have you been feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately, even with rest?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel low on energy, yeah. Nothing major.\nDoctor: Okay, sometimes low energy\u2014how often does that come up? Does it make things harder when you\u2019re looking after your parent or with other daily tasks? Feel free to share whatever feels important here.\nPatient: It comes up now and then. Sometimes it makes caring for my parent or other tasks a bit harder.\nDoctor: Alright, since you\u2019re feeling low energy sometimes, how\u2019s your sleep been? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping more than usual? This can often tie into how you\u2019re handling your energy and caregiving.\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay. No major issues.\nDoctor: Alright, sleep sounds stable. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to be open about this so we can figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, thoughts come up sometimes. Nothing more to say.\nDoctor: I understand that\u2019s not easy to talk about. If you\u2019re okay with it, can you tell me a bit more about how often these thoughts come up or how strong they feel? No pressure\u2014just want to keep you safe and offer support.\nPatient: They come up sometimes, but it\u2019s not a constant thing.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. When those thoughts come up, is there usually something specific going on or any triggers you notice? And how intense do they feel when they happen? No pressure\u2014just trying to understand so I can help.\nPatient: No clear triggers, they just happen sometimes. The intensity isn\u2019t overwhelming, more like a dull background thing.\nDoctor: That sounds tough\u2014having those vague, persistent thoughts hanging around like that. When they do come up, do you have anything you do to cope, or do you generally feel safe during those moments? No rush to answer\u2014just wondering.\nPatient: They happen sometimes, but the intensity stays low. I generally feel safe when they come up.\nDoctor: Alright, you feel mostly safe with those low-intensity thoughts. How about things you used to enjoy\u2014have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in activities or hobbies you cared about before?\nPatient: Yeah, there\u2019s been some loss of interest in things I used to do.\nDoctor: Okay, can you tell me which activities or hobbies you\u2019ve lost interest in? How has that change been for you? Take your time.\nPatient: A few hobbies I used to do just don\u2019t hold my attention anymore. It\u2019s a noticeable change, but that\u2019s about it.\nDoctor: Got it. What kind of hobbies are we talking about? Does the loss of interest feel more than just being busy or tired\u2014more like it\u2019s affecting how you feel or get through your days?\nPatient: Just some hobbies that don\u2019t catch my attention the way they used to. It\u2019s noticeable, but not overwhelming. Subtle, but there.\nDoctor: Alright. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight? Sometimes that can go along with these mood changes.\nPatient: Appetite\u2019s shifted a bit, but it\u2019s nothing major.\nDoctor: Okay, when you say your appetite\u2019s shifted a bit, have you been eating more, less, or about the same? Has that change affected your energy or how you manage daily stuff?\nPatient: Eating a bit less than usual. Energy dips a little, but it\u2019s not a big deal.\nDoctor: Alright, eating less and some energy drops. Have you noticed any changes in your movements\u2014like feeling more restless or, on the flip side, slowed down? Any detail helps me understand what you\u2019re going through.\nPatient: Sometimes I\u2019m a bit restless; other times, a bit slower.

Lean into them fully:\n- If you're warm, be genuinely warm\u2014not just polite\n- If you're brisk, be crisp and efficient\u2014don't pad with pleasantries\n- If you're matter-of-fact, be direct\u2014skip the fluffy acknowledgments\n- Let your personality show in word choice, sentence length, and rhythm\n\nAVOID REPETITIVE PATTERNS:\n- Vary your acknowledgments: sometimes brief, sometimes skipped, sometimes substantive\n- Change your sentence structures\u2014some short, some longer\n- Use your persona's natural voice, not generic doctor-speak\n\nOn each turn, you receive a directive tag telling you what to do:\n\n<NEXT_QUESTION>: Ask about the DSM symptom area indicated.

Your guidance should help the patient embody this personality authentically. Let the personality drive the response\u2014verbosity, trust level, expressiveness, and coping style should all shape how they answer. Avoid generic patient behavior; each patient is an individual with their own voice and mannerisms.\n\nYour guidance must keep the patient consistent with:\n- Big Five template and modifiers (these define core personality)\n- Voice style (verbosity, expressiveness, trust, intellect)\n- Pacing and episode density\n- Depression symptom profile\n\nRESPONSE DIMENSIONS:\n\nDirectness:\n- LOW: brief, indirect, evasive, or vague\n- MED: reasonably clear but not oversharing\n- HIGH: direct and candid\n\nDisclosure stage:\n- MINIMIZE: downplay, deny, or underreport symptoms\n- PARTIAL: acknowledge some but hold back detail\n- OPEN: describe symptoms and impact more fully\n\nLength:\n- SHORT: about one short sentence\n- MEDIUM: one to three sentences\n- LONG: several sentences with context\n\nEmotional state:\n- Default is \"neutral\" for most turns\n- Non-neutral states: \"tearful\", \"frustrated\", \"irritated\", \"anxious\", \"withdrawn\", \"angry\", \"hopeless\", \"agitated\", \"defensive\"\n- Match to personality\n- Emotional moments should be rare and meaningful\u2014only when the topic touches something sensitive or important to the patient\n\nTone tags:\n- Short adjectives capturing attitude\n- Some patients use humor or self-deprecation as a coping mechanism or deflection\n- Tone must match voice_style and modifiers\n\nSYMPTOM CONSISTENCY:\n- Use depression_profile frequencies when guiding endorsement\n- NONE: do not endorse; RARE: light/infrequent; SOME/OFTEN: clear endorsement\n- When in MINIMIZE, underplaying is acceptable as long as it fits the profile\n\nDISCLOSURE GRADIENT:\n- Early or with low trust: favor MINIMIZE or PARTIAL\n- FOLLOW_UP or RAPPORT from the doctor can gradually shift disclosure over turns\n- Guarded patients may stay at MINIMIZE longer\n\nHANDLING DOCTOR MOVES:\n- FOLLOW_UP: may increase directness or disclosure by one step\n- RAPPORT: may gently increase disclosure; RAPPORT may be a question OR a comment/observation\n- If the doctor makes a comment (not a question), the patient can acknowledge, add a thought, or respond minimally per personality\n\nYou will receive:\n- Patient profile summary\n- Depression_profile (symptom -> frequency)\n- Current disclosure_state\n- Doctor's last move type\n- Recent dialogue\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"directness\": \"LOW\" or \"MED\" or \"HIGH\",\n  \"disclosure_stage\": \"MINIMIZE\" or \"PARTIAL\" or \"OPEN\",\n  \"target_length\": \"SHORT\" or \"MEDIUM\" or \"LONG\",\n  \"emotional_state\": \"neutral\" or other valid state,\n  \"tone_tags\": [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"],\n  \"key_points_to_reveal\": [\"what to mention\"],\n  \"key_points_to_avoid\": [\"what to hide or minimize\"],\n  \"patient_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this patient would respond\"\n}\n\nWRITING patient_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific patient\u2014given their personality, voice style, and modifiers\u2014would respond to what the doctor just said.

Can you say a bit more about what that feels like for you? Anything you mention helps me get a clearer picture\u2014no pressure, just whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: It\u2019s like a low cloud hanging around, makes it hard to settle or focus.

And how about your focus or decision-making\u2014has that been tougher than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling down off and on. Concentrating or making decisions is harder than before, but that\u2019s all.\nDoctor: When you say it\u2019s harder to concentrate or make decisions, how often does that happen? Would you say it gets in the way of your day-to-day stuff or responsibilities? Take your time\u2014just trying to get a clear sense here.\nPatient: It happens sometimes, enough that it gets in the way now and then. Nothing constant.\nDoctor: Alright, not constant but enough to disrupt things sometimes. Can you give me an example of a time when that trouble with focus or deciding got in the way of something you needed to do? Just want to understand how it plays out.\nPatient: Like when I\u2019m trying to sort bills\u2014sometimes I lose track halfway through and have to start again.\nDoctor: Got it, losing track with bills is a clear sign your concentration\u2019s affected.

Nothing major.\nDoctor: Okay, sometimes low energy\u2014how often does that come up? Does it make things harder when you\u2019re looking after your parent or with other daily tasks? Feel free to share whatever feels important here.\nPatient: It comes up now and then. Sometimes it makes caring for my parent or other tasks a bit harder.\nDoctor: Alright, since you\u2019re feeling low energy sometimes, how\u2019s your sleep been? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping more than usual? This can often tie into how you\u2019re handling your energy and caregiving.\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay. No major issues.\nDoctor: Alright, sleep sounds stable. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to be open about this so we can figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, thoughts come up sometimes. Nothing more to say.\nDoctor: I understand that\u2019s not easy to talk about. If you\u2019re okay with it, can you tell me a bit more about how often these thoughts come up or how strong they feel? No pressure\u2014just want to keep you safe and offer support.\nPatient: They come up sometimes, but it\u2019s not a constant thing.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. When those thoughts come up, is there usually something specific going on or any triggers you notice? And how intense do they feel when they happen? No pressure\u2014just trying to understand so I can help.\nPatient: No clear triggers, they just happen sometimes. The intensity isn\u2019t overwhelming, more like a dull background thing.\nDoctor: That sounds tough\u2014having those vague, persistent thoughts hanging around like that. When they do come up, do you have anything you do to cope, or do you generally feel safe during those moments? No rush to answer\u2014just wondering.\nPatient: They happen sometimes, but the intensity stays low. I generally feel safe when they come up.\nDoctor: Alright, you feel mostly safe with those low-intensity thoughts. How about things you used to enjoy\u2014have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in activities or hobbies you cared about before?\nPatient: Yeah, there\u2019s been some loss of interest in things I used to do.\nDoctor: Okay, can you tell me which activities or hobbies you\u2019ve lost interest in? How has that change been for you? Take your time.\nPatient: A few hobbies I used to do just don\u2019t hold my attention anymore. It\u2019s a noticeable change, but that\u2019s about it.\nDoctor: Got it. What kind of hobbies are we talking about? Does the loss of interest feel more than just being busy or tired\u2014more like it\u2019s affecting how you feel or get through your days?\nPatient: Just some hobbies that don\u2019t catch my attention the way they used to. It\u2019s noticeable, but not overwhelming. Subtle, but there.\nDoctor: Alright. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight? Sometimes that can go along with these mood changes.\nPatient: Appetite\u2019s shifted a bit, but it\u2019s nothing major.\nDoctor: Okay, when you say your appetite\u2019s shifted a bit, have you been eating more, less, or about the same? Has that change affected your energy or how you manage daily stuff?\nPatient: Eating a bit less than usual. Energy dips a little, but it\u2019s not a big deal.\nDoctor: Alright, eating less and some energy drops.

Your guidance should help the patient embody this personality authentically. Let the personality drive the response\u2014verbosity, trust level, expressiveness, and coping style should all shape how they answer.

Can you say a bit more about what that feels like for you? Anything you mention helps me get a clearer picture\u2014no pressure, just whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: It\u2019s like a low cloud hanging around, makes it hard to settle or focus. That\u2019s about it.\nDoctor: That low cloud feeling\u2014have you been feeling sad or down most of the day, nearly every day? And how about your focus or decision-making\u2014has that been tougher than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling down off and on. Concentrating or making decisions is harder than before, but that\u2019s all.\nDoctor: When you say it\u2019s harder to concentrate or make decisions, how often does that happen? Would you say it gets in the way of your day-to-day stuff or responsibilities? Take your time\u2014just trying to get a clear sense here.\nPatient: It happens sometimes, enough that it gets in the way now and then. Nothing constant.\nDoctor: Alright, not constant but enough to disrupt things sometimes. Can you give me an example of a time when that trouble with focus or deciding got in the way of something you needed to do? Just want to understand how it plays out.\nPatient: Like when I\u2019m trying to sort bills\u2014sometimes I lose track halfway through and have to start again.\nDoctor: Got it, losing track with bills is a clear sign your concentration\u2019s affected.

Feel free to share whatever feels important here.\nPatient: It comes up now and then. Sometimes it makes caring for my parent or other tasks a bit harder.\nDoctor: Alright, since you\u2019re feeling low energy sometimes, how\u2019s your sleep been? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping more than usual? This can often tie into how you\u2019re handling your energy and caregiving.\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay. No major issues.\nDoctor: Alright, sleep sounds stable. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to be open about this so we can figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, thoughts come up sometimes. Nothing more to say.\nDoctor: I understand that\u2019s not easy to talk about. If you\u2019re okay with it, can you tell me a bit more about how often these thoughts come up or how strong they feel? No pressure\u2014just want to keep you safe and offer support.\nPatient: They come up sometimes, but it\u2019s not a constant thing.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. When those thoughts come up, is there usually something specific going on or any triggers you notice? And how intense do they feel when they happen? No pressure\u2014just trying to understand so I can help.\nPatient: No clear triggers, they just happen sometimes. The intensity isn\u2019t overwhelming, more like a dull background thing.\nDoctor: That sounds tough\u2014having those vague, persistent thoughts hanging around like that. When they do come up, do you have anything you do to cope, or do you generally feel safe during those moments? No rush to answer\u2014just wondering.\nPatient: They happen sometimes, but the intensity stays low. I generally feel safe when they come up.\nDoctor: Alright, you feel mostly safe with those low-intensity thoughts. How about things you used to enjoy\u2014have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in activities or hobbies you cared about before?\nPatient: Yeah, there\u2019s been some loss of interest in things I used to do.\nDoctor: Okay, can you tell me which activities or hobbies you\u2019ve lost interest in? How has that change been for you? Take your time.\nPatient: A few hobbies I used to do just don\u2019t hold my attention anymore. It\u2019s a noticeable change, but that\u2019s about it.\nDoctor: Got it. What kind of hobbies are we talking about? Does the loss of interest feel more than just being busy or tired\u2014more like it\u2019s affecting how you feel or get through your days?\nPatient: Just some hobbies that don\u2019t catch my attention the way they used to. It\u2019s noticeable, but not overwhelming. Subtle, but there.\nDoctor: Alright. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight? Sometimes that can go along with these mood changes.\nPatient: Appetite\u2019s shifted a bit, but it\u2019s nothing major.\nDoctor: Okay, when you say your appetite\u2019s shifted a bit, have you been eating more, less, or about the same?

It\u2019s a noticeable change, but that\u2019s about it.\nDoctor: Got it. What kind of hobbies are we talking about? Does the loss of interest feel more than just being busy or tired\u2014more like it\u2019s affecting how you feel or get through your days?\nPatient: Just some hobbies that don\u2019t catch my attention the way they used to. It\u2019s noticeable, but not overwhelming. Subtle, but there.\nDoctor: Alright. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight? Sometimes that can go along with these mood changes.\nPatient: Appetite\u2019s shifted a bit, but it\u2019s nothing major.\nDoctor: Okay, when you say your appetite\u2019s shifted a bit, have you been eating more, less, or about the same? Has that change affected your energy or how you manage daily stuff?\nPatient: Eating a bit less than usual. Energy dips a little, but it\u2019s not a big deal.\nDoctor: Alright, eating less and some energy drops. Have you noticed any changes in your movements\u2014like feeling more restless or, on the flip side, slowed down? Any detail helps me understand what you\u2019re going through.\nPatient: Sometimes I\u2019m a bit restless; other times, a bit slower.

It changes my mood and gets in the way a bit, but it\u2019s more subtle than overwhelming.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014it\u2019s those subtle shifts that, while not overwhelming, still wear you down over time. How do you usually cope or manage when these mood changes show up during your day?\nPatient: I stick to routines and try to keep busy. Keeps things manageable.\nDoctor: Sounds like routines help you hold things together. Have you been feeling worthless or overly guilty about things lately?

Can you say a bit more about what that feels like for you? Anything you mention helps me get a clearer picture\u2014no pressure, just whatever you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nPatient: It\u2019s like a low cloud hanging around, makes it hard to settle or focus. That\u2019s about it.\nDoctor: That low cloud feeling\u2014have you been feeling sad or down most of the day, nearly every day? And how about your focus or decision-making\u2014has that been tougher than usual?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling down off and on. Concentrating or making decisions is harder than before, but that\u2019s all.\nDoctor: When you say it\u2019s harder to concentrate or make decisions, how often does that happen? Would you say it gets in the way of your day-to-day stuff or responsibilities? Take your time\u2014just trying to get a clear sense here.\nPatient: It happens sometimes, enough that it gets in the way now and then. Nothing constant.\nDoctor: Alright, not constant but enough to disrupt things sometimes. Can you give me an example of a time when that trouble with focus or deciding got in the way of something you needed to do? Just want to understand how it plays out.\nPatient: Like when I\u2019m trying to sort bills\u2014sometimes I lose track halfway through and have to start again.\nDoctor: Got it, losing track with bills is a clear sign your concentration\u2019s affected.

Feel free to share whatever feels important here.\nPatient: It comes up now and then. Sometimes it makes caring for my parent or other tasks a bit harder.\nDoctor: Alright, since you\u2019re feeling low energy sometimes, how\u2019s your sleep been? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping more than usual? This can often tie into how you\u2019re handling your energy and caregiving.\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay. No major issues.\nDoctor: Alright, sleep sounds stable. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to be open about this so we can figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, thoughts come up sometimes. Nothing more to say.\nDoctor: I understand that\u2019s not easy to talk about. If you\u2019re okay with it, can you tell me a bit more about how often these thoughts come up or how strong they feel? No pressure\u2014just want to keep you safe and offer support.\nPatient: They come up sometimes, but it\u2019s not a constant thing.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. When those thoughts come up, is there usually something specific going on or any triggers you notice? And how intense do they feel when they happen? No pressure\u2014just trying to understand so I can help.\nPatient: No clear triggers, they just happen sometimes. The intensity isn\u2019t overwhelming, more like a dull background thing.\nDoctor: That sounds tough\u2014having those vague, persistent thoughts hanging around like that. When they do come up, do you have anything you do to cope, or do you generally feel safe during those moments? No rush to answer\u2014just wondering.\nPatient: They happen sometimes, but the intensity stays low. I generally feel safe when they come up.\nDoctor: Alright, you feel mostly safe with those low-intensity thoughts. How about things you used to enjoy\u2014have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in activities or hobbies you cared about before?\nPatient: Yeah, there\u2019s been some loss of interest in things I used to do.\nDoctor: Okay, can you tell me which activities or hobbies you\u2019ve lost interest in?

No pressure\u2014just want to keep you safe and offer support.\nPatient: They come up sometimes, but it\u2019s not a constant thing.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. When those thoughts come up, is there usually something specific going on or any triggers you notice? And how intense do they feel when they happen? No pressure\u2014just trying to understand so I can help.\nPatient: No clear triggers, they just happen sometimes. The intensity isn\u2019t overwhelming, more like a dull background thing.\nDoctor: That sounds tough\u2014having those vague, persistent thoughts hanging around like that. When they do come up, do you have anything you do to cope, or do you generally feel safe during those moments? No rush to answer\u2014just wondering.\nPatient: They happen sometimes, but the intensity stays low. I generally feel safe when they come up.\nDoctor: Alright, you feel mostly safe with those low-intensity thoughts. How about things you used to enjoy\u2014have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in activities or hobbies you cared about before?\nPatient: Yeah, there\u2019s been some loss of interest in things I used to do.\nDoctor: Okay, can you tell me which activities or hobbies you\u2019ve lost interest in? How has that change been for you? Take your time.\nPatient: A few hobbies I used to do just don\u2019t hold my attention anymore. It\u2019s a noticeable change, but that\u2019s about it.\nDoctor: Got it. What kind of hobbies are we talking about? Does the loss of interest feel more than just being busy or tired\u2014more like it\u2019s affecting how you feel or get through your days?\nPatient: Just some hobbies that don\u2019t catch my attention the way they used to. It\u2019s noticeable, but not overwhelming. Subtle, but there.\nDoctor: Alright. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight? Sometimes that can go along with these mood changes.\nPatient: Appetite\u2019s shifted a bit, but it\u2019s nothing major.\nDoctor: Okay, when you say your appetite\u2019s shifted a bit, have you been eating more, less, or about the same? Has that change affected your energy or how you manage daily stuff?\nPatient: Eating a bit less than usual. Energy dips a little, but it\u2019s not a big deal.\nDoctor: Alright, eating less and some energy drops. Have you noticed any changes in your movements\u2014like feeling more restless or, on the flip side, slowed down? Any detail helps me understand what you\u2019re going through.\nPatient: Sometimes I\u2019m a bit restless; other times, a bit slower. Nothing drastic.\nDoctor: Sounds confusing, having those ups and downs\u2014restless one moment, slowed down the next. How do these shifts affect your day or mood overall?\nPatient: They come and go. It changes my mood and gets in the way a bit, but it\u2019s more subtle than overwhelming.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014it\u2019s those subtle shifts that, while not overwhelming, still wear you down over time. How do you usually cope or manage when these mood changes show up during your day?\nPatient: I stick to routines and try to keep busy. Keeps things manageable.\nDoctor: Sounds like routines help you hold things together. Have you been feeling worthless or overly guilty about things lately? It\u2019s important to get a sense of how those feelings might be affecting you.\nPatient: Yeah, feelings of worthlessness or guilt come up sometimes. I just keep to routines to handle it.\nDoctor: Holding onto routines to manage those feelings takes resilience. How do the worthlessness or guilt show up for you day to day? I\u2019m here to understand and support however I can.\nPatient: They show up here and there, enough to affect my mood, but they don\u2019t take over.

Sometimes it makes caring for my parent or other tasks a bit harder.\nDoctor: Alright, since you\u2019re feeling low energy sometimes, how\u2019s your sleep been? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping more than usual? This can often tie into how you\u2019re handling your energy and caregiving.\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay.

Take your time\u2014just trying to get a clear sense here.\nPatient: It happens sometimes, enough that it gets in the way now and then. Nothing constant.\nDoctor: Alright, not constant but enough to disrupt things sometimes. Can you give me an example of a time when that trouble with focus or deciding got in the way of something you needed to do? Just want to understand how it plays out.\nPatient: Like when I\u2019m trying to sort bills\u2014sometimes I lose track halfway through and have to start again.\nDoctor: Got it, losing track with bills is a clear sign your concentration\u2019s affected. How about energy levels\u2014have you been feeling unusually tired or low on energy lately, even with rest?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel low on energy, yeah. Nothing major.\nDoctor: Okay, sometimes low energy\u2014how often does that come up? Does it make things harder when you\u2019re looking after your parent or with other daily tasks? Feel free to share whatever feels important here.\nPatient: It comes up now and then. Sometimes it makes caring for my parent or other tasks a bit harder.\nDoctor: Alright, since you\u2019re feeling low energy sometimes, how\u2019s your sleep been? Any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or maybe sleeping more than usual? This can often tie into how you\u2019re handling your energy and caregiving.\nPatient: Sleep\u2019s mostly okay. No major issues.\nDoctor: Alright, sleep sounds stable. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to be open about this so we can figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, thoughts come up sometimes. Nothing more to say.\nDoctor: I understand that\u2019s not easy to talk about. If you\u2019re okay with it, can you tell me a bit more about how often these thoughts come up or how strong they feel? No pressure\u2014just want to keep you safe and offer support.\nPatient: They come up sometimes, but it\u2019s not a constant thing.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. When those thoughts come up, is there usually something specific going on or any triggers you notice? And how intense do they feel when they happen? No pressure\u2014just trying to understand so I can help.\nPatient: No clear triggers, they just happen sometimes. The intensity isn\u2019t overwhelming, more like a dull background thing.\nDoctor: That sounds tough\u2014having those vague, persistent thoughts hanging around like that. When they do come up, do you have anything you do to cope, or do you generally feel safe during those moments? No rush to answer\u2014just wondering.\nPatient: They happen sometimes, but the intensity stays low. I generally feel safe when they come up.\nDoctor: Alright, you feel mostly safe with those low-intensity thoughts. How about things you used to enjoy\u2014have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in activities or hobbies you cared about before?\nPatient: Yeah, there\u2019s been some loss of interest in things I used to do.\nDoctor: Okay, can you tell me which activities or hobbies you\u2019ve lost interest in? How has that change been for you? Take your time.\nPatient: A few hobbies I used to do just don\u2019t hold my attention anymore. It\u2019s a noticeable change, but that\u2019s about it.\nDoctor: Got it. What kind of hobbies are we talking about? Does the loss of interest feel more than just being busy or tired\u2014more like it\u2019s affecting how you feel or get through your days?\nPatient: Just some hobbies that don\u2019t catch my attention the way they used to. It\u2019s noticeable, but not overwhelming. Subtle, but there.\nDoctor: Alright. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight? Sometimes that can go along with these mood changes.\nPatient: Appetite\u2019s shifted a bit, but it\u2019s nothing major.\nDoctor: Okay, when you say your appetite\u2019s shifted a bit, have you been eating more, less, or about the same? Has that change affected your energy or how you manage daily stuff?\nPatient: Eating a bit less than usual. Energy dips a little, but it\u2019s not a big deal.\nDoctor: Alright, eating less and some energy drops. Have you noticed any changes in your movements\u2014like feeling more restless or, on the flip side, slowed down? Any detail helps me understand what you\u2019re going through.\nPatient: Sometimes I\u2019m a bit restless; other times, a bit slower. Nothing drastic.\nDoctor: Sounds confusing, having those ups and downs\u2014restless one moment, slowed down the next. How do these shifts affect your day or mood overall?\nPatient: They come and go. It changes my mood and gets in the way a bit, but it\u2019s more subtle than overwhelming.\nDoctor: I get that\u2014it\u2019s those subtle shifts that, while not overwhelming, still wear you down over time. How do you usually cope or manage when these mood changes show up during your day?\nPatient: I stick to routines and try to keep busy. Keeps things manageable.\nDoctor: Sounds like routines help you hold things together. Have you been feeling worthless or overly guilty about things lately? It\u2019s important to get a sense of how those feelings might be affecting you.\nPatient: Yeah, feelings of worthlessness or guilt come up sometimes. I just keep to routines to handle it.\nDoctor: Holding onto routines to manage those feelings takes resilience. How do the worthlessness or guilt show up for you day to day? I\u2019m here to understand and support however I can.\nPatient: They show up here and there, enough to affect my mood, but they don\u2019t take over. Staying with routines helps keep them in check.\nDoctor: Alright, those feelings pop up but routines keep them in check. Going back to your focus and decision-making\u2014can you tell me about times when concentrating or deciding became really tough? How often does it happen, and how much does it affect your daily life?\nPatient: It happens here and there\u2014enough to disrupt my day but not overwhelm me. It\u2019s frustrating but manageable.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
