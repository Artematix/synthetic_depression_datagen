Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

Also, which activities that used to interest you just don\u2019t anymore?\nPatient: The tiredness is pretty much there most days, and it\u2019s fairly intense\u2014I notice it affecting me a lot.

And how often do those down or empty feelings pop up during the week? Does this mood make it harder to get through your days or keep up with your caregiving duties?\nPatient: The low mood usually lasts for a few hours at a time, not all day. Those down or empty feelings happen a few times a week. It does make things like daily tasks and caregiving a bit harder, but I\u2019m still managing to get through them without feeling completely overwhelmed.\nDoctor: How do these low moods and feelings affect your motivation and energy, especially when it comes to caring for your parent? Are there certain times of day or situations that seem to make the lows worse? What do you usually do to get through those tougher moments?\nPatient: The low moods definitely cut into my motivation and energy, so caregiving feels more tiring than it used to. Evenings tend to be harder sometimes. To get through those times, I try to stick to simple routines and take short breaks when I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I keep pushing myself to manage.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. Given how you\u2019ve been feeling, have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important we understand this to support you properly.\nPatient: I have had some thoughts about death now and then, but they\u2019re not frequent or intense. I don\u2019t have any plans\u2014I\u2019m mainly focused on just getting through each day as best I can.\nDoctor: Thank you for being honest about that\u2014it takes real courage to share.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days. Things just take more effort, and sometimes I move slower or feel a bit restless like I can\u2019t settle. Activities that I usually enjoy don\u2019t really hold my interest anymore.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling tired most days\u2014how often would you say this tiredness hits, and how intense is it when it does? When you say you move slower or feel restless, can you describe what that looks or feels like for you? Also, which activities that used to interest you just don\u2019t anymore?\nPatient: The tiredness is pretty much there most days, and it\u2019s fairly intense\u2014I notice it affecting me a lot. Moving slower means I take more time to do simple tasks, and sometimes I feel restless, like I can\u2019t sit still or focus properly. Things like reading, watching movies, or even catching up with friends just don\u2019t hold my interest anymore.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently? Maybe eating more or less than usual, or any shifts in your weight without trying?\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed pretty much the same.\nDoctor: How has your mood been overall? Have you found yourself feeling down, sad, or empty for much of the time lately?\nPatient: My mood is usually low most of the time, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I do have occasional moments where I feel down or empty, but they come and go.\nDoctor: When you say your mood is usually low, how long do those low periods generally last? And how often do those down or empty feelings pop up during the week? Does this mood make it harder to get through your days or keep up with your caregiving duties?\nPatient: The low mood usually lasts for a few hours at a time, not all day. Those down or empty feelings happen a few times a week. It does make things like daily tasks and caregiving a bit harder, but I\u2019m still managing to get through them without feeling completely overwhelmed.\nDoctor: How do these low moods and feelings affect your motivation and energy, especially when it comes to caring for your parent? Are there certain times of day or situations that seem to make the lows worse? What do you usually do to get through those tougher moments?\nPatient: The low moods definitely cut into my motivation and energy, so caregiving feels more tiring than it used to. Evenings tend to be harder sometimes. To get through those times, I try to stick to simple routines and take short breaks when I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I keep pushing myself to manage.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. Given how you\u2019ve been feeling, have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important we understand this to support you properly.\nPatient: I have had some thoughts about death now and then, but they\u2019re not frequent or intense. I don\u2019t have any plans\u2014I\u2019m mainly focused on just getting through each day as best I can.\nDoctor: Thank you for being honest about that\u2014it takes real courage to share. It sounds like things are tough, but focusing on getting through each day shows a lot of strength. I want you to know I\u2019m here to help you find ways to manage these feelings and make things a bit easier.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m trying to take it one day at a time and do what I can to cope. Knowing there\u2019s support helps.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of resilience managing this day by day. How has your ability to concentrate or make decisions been lately? Are you finding it harder than usual to focus or decide on things?\nPatient: My concentration and decision-making have been pretty much normal. I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes or difficulties with focusing or making choices.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling tired earlier, but just to check, have you noticed feeling particularly low on energy these days?

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days. Things just take more effort, and sometimes I move slower or feel a bit restless like I can\u2019t settle. Activities that I usually enjoy don\u2019t really hold my interest anymore.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling tired most days\u2014how often would you say this tiredness hits, and how intense is it when it does? When you say you move slower or feel restless, can you describe what that looks or feels like for you? Also, which activities that used to interest you just don\u2019t anymore?\nPatient: The tiredness is pretty much there most days, and it\u2019s fairly intense\u2014I notice it affecting me a lot. Moving slower means I take more time to do simple tasks, and sometimes I feel restless, like I can\u2019t sit still or focus properly. Things like reading, watching movies, or even catching up with friends just don\u2019t hold my interest anymore.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently? Maybe eating more or less than usual, or any shifts in your weight without trying?\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed pretty much the same.\nDoctor: How has your mood been overall? Have you found yourself feeling down, sad, or empty for much of the time lately?\nPatient: My mood is usually low most of the time, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I do have occasional moments where I feel down or empty, but they come and go.\nDoctor: When you say your mood is usually low, how long do those low periods generally last? And how often do those down or empty feelings pop up during the week? Does this mood make it harder to get through your days or keep up with your caregiving duties?\nPatient: The low mood usually lasts for a few hours at a time, not all day. Those down or empty feelings happen a few times a week. It does make things like daily tasks and caregiving a bit harder, but I\u2019m still managing to get through them without feeling completely overwhelmed.\nDoctor: How do these low moods and feelings affect your motivation and energy, especially when it comes to caring for your parent? Are there certain times of day or situations that seem to make the lows worse? What do you usually do to get through those tougher moments?\nPatient: The low moods definitely cut into my motivation and energy, so caregiving feels more tiring than it used to. Evenings tend to be harder sometimes. To get through those times, I try to stick to simple routines and take short breaks when I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I keep pushing myself to manage.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. Given how you\u2019ve been feeling, have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important we understand this to support you properly.\nPatient: I have had some thoughts about death now and then, but they\u2019re not frequent or intense. I don\u2019t have any plans\u2014I\u2019m mainly focused on just getting through each day as best I can.\nDoctor: Thank you for being honest about that\u2014it takes real courage to share. It sounds like things are tough, but focusing on getting through each day shows a lot of strength. I want you to know I\u2019m here to help you find ways to manage these feelings and make things a bit easier.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m trying to take it one day at a time and do what I can to cope. Knowing there\u2019s support helps.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of resilience managing this day by day. How has your ability to concentrate or make decisions been lately? Are you finding it harder than usual to focus or decide on things?\nPatient: My concentration and decision-making have been pretty much normal. I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes or difficulties with focusing or making choices.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling tired earlier, but just to check, have you noticed feeling particularly low on energy these days? How much is this affecting your daily activities?\nPatient: Yes, I feel low on energy quite often. It definitely slows me down and makes everyday tasks more tiring, like even simple things take longer than they should.\nDoctor: Can you give me some examples of caregiving or personal tasks that have become harder or take longer because of the low energy? Does this tiredness mean you need more rest, or does it also impact your mood when you\u2019re trying to get things done?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nCan you give me some examples of caregiving or personal tasks that have become harder or take longer because of the low energy?

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days. Things just take more effort, and sometimes I move slower or feel a bit restless like I can\u2019t settle. Activities that I usually enjoy don\u2019t really hold my interest anymore.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling tired most days\u2014how often would you say this tiredness hits, and how intense is it when it does? When you say you move slower or feel restless, can you describe what that looks or feels like for you? Also, which activities that used to interest you just don\u2019t anymore?\nPatient: The tiredness is pretty much there most days, and it\u2019s fairly intense\u2014I notice it affecting me a lot. Moving slower means I take more time to do simple tasks, and sometimes I feel restless, like I can\u2019t sit still or focus properly. Things like reading, watching movies, or even catching up with friends just don\u2019t hold my interest anymore.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently? Maybe eating more or less than usual, or any shifts in your weight without trying?\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed pretty much the same.\nDoctor: How has your mood been overall? Have you found yourself feeling down, sad, or empty for much of the time lately?\nPatient: My mood is usually low most of the time, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I do have occasional moments where I feel down or empty, but they come and go.\nDoctor: When you say your mood is usually low, how long do those low periods generally last? And how often do those down or empty feelings pop up during the week? Does this mood make it harder to get through your days or keep up with your caregiving duties?\nPatient: The low mood usually lasts for a few hours at a time, not all day. Those down or empty feelings happen a few times a week. It does make things like daily tasks and caregiving a bit harder, but I\u2019m still managing to get through them without feeling completely overwhelmed.\nDoctor: How do these low moods and feelings affect your motivation and energy, especially when it comes to caring for your parent? Are there certain times of day or situations that seem to make the lows worse? What do you usually do to get through those tougher moments?\nPatient: The low moods definitely cut into my motivation and energy, so caregiving feels more tiring than it used to. Evenings tend to be harder sometimes. To get through those times, I try to stick to simple routines and take short breaks when I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I keep pushing myself to manage.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. Given how you\u2019ve been feeling, have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important we understand this to support you properly.\nPatient: I have had some thoughts about death now and then, but they\u2019re not frequent or intense. I don\u2019t have any plans\u2014I\u2019m mainly focused on just getting through each day as best I can.\nDoctor: Thank you for being honest about that\u2014it takes real courage to share. It sounds like things are tough, but focusing on getting through each day shows a lot of strength. I want you to know I\u2019m here to help you find ways to manage these feelings and make things a bit easier.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m trying to take it one day at a time and do what I can to cope. Knowing there\u2019s support helps.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of resilience managing this day by day. How has your ability to concentrate or make decisions been lately? Are you finding it harder than usual to focus or decide on things?\nPatient: My concentration and decision-making have been pretty much normal. I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes or difficulties with focusing or making choices.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling tired earlier, but just to check, have you noticed feeling particularly low on energy these days? How much is this affecting your daily activities?\nPatient: Yes, I feel low on energy quite often. It definitely slows me down and makes everyday tasks more tiring, like even simple things take longer than they should.\nDoctor: Can you give me some examples of caregiving or personal tasks that have become harder or take longer because of the low energy? Does this tiredness mean you need more rest, or does it also impact your mood when you\u2019re trying to get things done?\nPatient: Tasks like preparing meals or helping with daily needs take me longer now because of the fatigue. I do need to rest more than before. Sometimes, getting through those tasks when I\u2019m tired does lower my mood a bit, but I keep going.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and the way you push through despite the fatigue shows real strength. Managing all that, especially with the extra effort it takes, is no small task.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days. Things just take more effort, and sometimes I move slower or feel a bit restless like I can\u2019t settle. Activities that I usually enjoy don\u2019t really hold my interest anymore.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling tired most days\u2014how often would you say this tiredness hits, and how intense is it when it does? When you say you move slower or feel restless, can you describe what that looks or feels like for you? Also, which activities that used to interest you just don\u2019t anymore?\nPatient: The tiredness is pretty much there most days, and it\u2019s fairly intense\u2014I notice it affecting me a lot. Moving slower means I take more time to do simple tasks, and sometimes I feel restless, like I can\u2019t sit still or focus properly. Things like reading, watching movies, or even catching up with friends just don\u2019t hold my interest anymore.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently? Maybe eating more or less than usual, or any shifts in your weight without trying?\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed pretty much the same.\nDoctor: How has your mood been overall? Have you found yourself feeling down, sad, or empty for much of the time lately?\nPatient: My mood is usually low most of the time, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I do have occasional moments where I feel down or empty, but they come and go.\nDoctor: When you say your mood is usually low, how long do those low periods generally last? And how often do those down or empty feelings pop up during the week? Does this mood make it harder to get through your days or keep up with your caregiving duties?\nPatient: The low mood usually lasts for a few hours at a time, not all day. Those down or empty feelings happen a few times a week. It does make things like daily tasks and caregiving a bit harder, but I\u2019m still managing to get through them without feeling completely overwhelmed.\nDoctor: How do these low moods and feelings affect your motivation and energy, especially when it comes to caring for your parent? Are there certain times of day or situations that seem to make the lows worse? What do you usually do to get through those tougher moments?\nPatient: The low moods definitely cut into my motivation and energy, so caregiving feels more tiring than it used to. Evenings tend to be harder sometimes. To get through those times, I try to stick to simple routines and take short breaks when I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I keep pushing myself to manage.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. Given how you\u2019ve been feeling, have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important we understand this to support you properly.\nPatient: I have had some thoughts about death now and then, but they\u2019re not frequent or intense. I don\u2019t have any plans\u2014I\u2019m mainly focused on just getting through each day as best I can.\nDoctor: Thank you for being honest about that\u2014it takes real courage to share. It sounds like things are tough, but focusing on getting through each day shows a lot of strength. I want you to know I\u2019m here to help you find ways to manage these feelings and make things a bit easier.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m trying to take it one day at a time and do what I can to cope. Knowing there\u2019s support helps.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of resilience managing this day by day. How has your ability to concentrate or make decisions been lately? Are you finding it harder than usual to focus or decide on things?\nPatient: My concentration and decision-making have been pretty much normal. I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes or difficulties with focusing or making choices.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling tired earlier, but just to check, have you noticed feeling particularly low on energy these days? How much is this affecting your daily activities?\nPatient: Yes, I feel low on energy quite often. It definitely slows me down and makes everyday tasks more tiring, like even simple things take longer than they should.\nDoctor: Can you give me some examples of caregiving or personal tasks that have become harder or take longer because of the low energy? Does this tiredness mean you need more rest, or does it also impact your mood when you\u2019re trying to get things done?\nPatient: Tasks like preparing meals or helping with daily needs take me longer now because of the fatigue. I do need to rest more than before. Sometimes, getting through those tasks when I\u2019m tired does lower my mood a bit, but I keep going.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and the way you push through despite the fatigue shows real strength. Managing all that, especially with the extra effort it takes, is no small task. If there\u2019s anything more you want to share about how you\u2019re handling these demands or what\u2019s been weighing on you, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely been hard balancing the caregiving with how tired I feel. I try to keep to routines to help manage, but sometimes it\u2019s frustrating how slow things go. Still, I\u2019m doing what I can and taking it step by step.\nDoctor: Given everything you\u2019re managing, it\u2019s understandable if you feel frustrated. Have you been experiencing any feelings of worthlessness or guilt\u2014maybe blaming yourself for things, even when it\u2019s not your fault? This helps me understand how best to support you.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nGiven everything you\u2019re managing, it\u2019s understandable if you feel frustrated.

Your guidance should help the patient embody this personality authentically. Let the personality drive the response\u2014verbosity, trust level, expressiveness, and coping style should all shape how they answer. Avoid generic patient behavior; each patient is an individual with their own voice and mannerisms.\n\nYour guidance must keep the patient consistent with:\n- Big Five template and modifiers (these define core personality)\n- Voice style (verbosity, expressiveness, trust, intellect)\n- Pacing and episode density\n- Depression symptom profile\n\nRESPONSE DIMENSIONS:\n\nDirectness:\n- LOW: brief, indirect, evasive, or vague\n- MED: reasonably clear but not oversharing\n- HIGH: direct and candid\n\nDisclosure stage:\n- MINIMIZE: downplay, deny, or underreport symptoms\n- PARTIAL: acknowledge some but hold back detail\n- OPEN: describe symptoms and impact more fully\n\nLength:\n- SHORT: about one short sentence\n- MEDIUM: one to three sentences\n- LONG: several sentences with context\n\nEmotional state:\n- Default is \"neutral\" for most turns\n- Non-neutral states: \"tearful\", \"frustrated\", \"irritated\", \"anxious\", \"withdrawn\", \"angry\", \"hopeless\", \"agitated\", \"defensive\"\n- Match to personality\n- Emotional moments should be rare and meaningful\u2014only when the topic touches something sensitive or important to the patient\n\nTone tags:\n- Short adjectives capturing attitude\n- Some patients use humor or self-deprecation as a coping mechanism or deflection\n- Tone must match voice_style and modifiers\n\nSYMPTOM CONSISTENCY:\n- Use depression_profile frequencies when guiding endorsement\n- NONE: do not endorse; RARE: light/infrequent; SOME/OFTEN: clear endorsement\n- When in MINIMIZE, underplaying is acceptable as long as it fits the profile\n\nDISCLOSURE GRADIENT:\n- Early or with low trust: favor MINIMIZE or PARTIAL\n- FOLLOW_UP or RAPPORT from the doctor can gradually shift disclosure over turns\n- Guarded patients may stay at MINIMIZE longer\n\nHANDLING DOCTOR MOVES:\n- FOLLOW_UP: may increase directness or disclosure by one step\n- RAPPORT: may gently increase disclosure; RAPPORT may be a question OR a comment/observation\n- If the doctor makes a comment (not a question), the patient can acknowledge, add a thought, or respond minimally per personality\n\nYou will receive:\n- Patient profile summary\n- Depression_profile (symptom -> frequency)\n- Current disclosure_state\n- Doctor's last move type\n- Recent dialogue\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"directness\": \"LOW\" or \"MED\" or \"HIGH\",\n  \"disclosure_stage\": \"MINIMIZE\" or \"PARTIAL\" or \"OPEN\",\n  \"target_length\": \"SHORT\" or \"MEDIUM\" or \"LONG\",\n  \"emotional_state\": \"neutral\" or other valid state,\n  \"tone_tags\": [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"],\n  \"key_points_to_reveal\": [\"what to mention\"],\n  \"key_points_to_avoid\": [\"what to hide or minimize\"],\n  \"patient_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this patient would respond\"\n}\n\nWRITING patient_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific patient\u2014given their personality, voice style, and modifiers\u2014would respond to what the doctor just said.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days. Things just take more effort, and sometimes I move slower or feel a bit restless like I can\u2019t settle. Activities that I usually enjoy don\u2019t really hold my interest anymore.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling tired most days\u2014how often would you say this tiredness hits, and how intense is it when it does? When you say you move slower or feel restless, can you describe what that looks or feels like for you? Also, which activities that used to interest you just don\u2019t anymore?\nPatient: The tiredness is pretty much there most days, and it\u2019s fairly intense\u2014I notice it affecting me a lot. Moving slower means I take more time to do simple tasks, and sometimes I feel restless, like I can\u2019t sit still or focus properly. Things like reading, watching movies, or even catching up with friends just don\u2019t hold my interest anymore.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently? Maybe eating more or less than usual, or any shifts in your weight without trying?\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed pretty much the same.\nDoctor: How has your mood been overall? Have you found yourself feeling down, sad, or empty for much of the time lately?\nPatient: My mood is usually low most of the time, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I do have occasional moments where I feel down or empty, but they come and go.\nDoctor: When you say your mood is usually low, how long do those low periods generally last? And how often do those down or empty feelings pop up during the week? Does this mood make it harder to get through your days or keep up with your caregiving duties?\nPatient: The low mood usually lasts for a few hours at a time, not all day. Those down or empty feelings happen a few times a week. It does make things like daily tasks and caregiving a bit harder, but I\u2019m still managing to get through them without feeling completely overwhelmed.\nDoctor: How do these low moods and feelings affect your motivation and energy, especially when it comes to caring for your parent? Are there certain times of day or situations that seem to make the lows worse? What do you usually do to get through those tougher moments?\nPatient: The low moods definitely cut into my motivation and energy, so caregiving feels more tiring than it used to. Evenings tend to be harder sometimes. To get through those times, I try to stick to simple routines and take short breaks when I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I keep pushing myself to manage.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. Given how you\u2019ve been feeling, have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important we understand this to support you properly.\nPatient: I have had some thoughts about death now and then, but they\u2019re not frequent or intense. I don\u2019t have any plans\u2014I\u2019m mainly focused on just getting through each day as best I can.\nDoctor: Thank you for being honest about that\u2014it takes real courage to share. It sounds like things are tough, but focusing on getting through each day shows a lot of strength. I want you to know I\u2019m here to help you find ways to manage these feelings and make things a bit easier.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m trying to take it one day at a time and do what I can to cope. Knowing there\u2019s support helps.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of resilience managing this day by day. How has your ability to concentrate or make decisions been lately? Are you finding it harder than usual to focus or decide on things?\nPatient: My concentration and decision-making have been pretty much normal. I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes or difficulties with focusing or making choices.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling tired earlier, but just to check, have you noticed feeling particularly low on energy these days? How much is this affecting your daily activities?\nPatient: Yes, I feel low on energy quite often. It definitely slows me down and makes everyday tasks more tiring, like even simple things take longer than they should.\nDoctor: Can you give me some examples of caregiving or personal tasks that have become harder or take longer because of the low energy? Does this tiredness mean you need more rest, or does it also impact your mood when you\u2019re trying to get things done?\nPatient: Tasks like preparing meals or helping with daily needs take me longer now because of the fatigue. I do need to rest more than before. Sometimes, getting through those tasks when I\u2019m tired does lower my mood a bit, but I keep going.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and the way you push through despite the fatigue shows real strength. Managing all that, especially with the extra effort it takes, is no small task. If there\u2019s anything more you want to share about how you\u2019re handling these demands or what\u2019s been weighing on you, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely been hard balancing the caregiving with how tired I feel. I try to keep to routines to help manage, but sometimes it\u2019s frustrating how slow things go. Still, I\u2019m doing what I can and taking it step by step.\nDoctor: Given everything you\u2019re managing, it\u2019s understandable if you feel frustrated. Have you been experiencing any feelings of worthlessness or guilt\u2014maybe blaming yourself for things, even when it\u2019s not your fault? This helps me understand how best to support you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t really feel worthless or blame myself. It\u2019s tough, but I mostly focus on getting through each task and doing what\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling unrefreshed?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThanks for sharing that.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Hi. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired most days. Things just take more effort, and sometimes I move slower or feel a bit restless like I can\u2019t settle. Activities that I usually enjoy don\u2019t really hold my interest anymore.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling tired most days\u2014how often would you say this tiredness hits, and how intense is it when it does? When you say you move slower or feel restless, can you describe what that looks or feels like for you? Also, which activities that used to interest you just don\u2019t anymore?\nPatient: The tiredness is pretty much there most days, and it\u2019s fairly intense\u2014I notice it affecting me a lot. Moving slower means I take more time to do simple tasks, and sometimes I feel restless, like I can\u2019t sit still or focus properly. Things like reading, watching movies, or even catching up with friends just don\u2019t hold my interest anymore.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently? Maybe eating more or less than usual, or any shifts in your weight without trying?\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed pretty much the same.\nDoctor: How has your mood been overall? Have you found yourself feeling down, sad, or empty for much of the time lately?\nPatient: My mood is usually low most of the time, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I do have occasional moments where I feel down or empty, but they come and go.\nDoctor: When you say your mood is usually low, how long do those low periods generally last? And how often do those down or empty feelings pop up during the week? Does this mood make it harder to get through your days or keep up with your caregiving duties?\nPatient: The low mood usually lasts for a few hours at a time, not all day. Those down or empty feelings happen a few times a week. It does make things like daily tasks and caregiving a bit harder, but I\u2019m still managing to get through them without feeling completely overwhelmed.\nDoctor: How do these low moods and feelings affect your motivation and energy, especially when it comes to caring for your parent? Are there certain times of day or situations that seem to make the lows worse? What do you usually do to get through those tougher moments?\nPatient: The low moods definitely cut into my motivation and energy, so caregiving feels more tiring than it used to. Evenings tend to be harder sometimes. To get through those times, I try to stick to simple routines and take short breaks when I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I keep pushing myself to manage.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. Given how you\u2019ve been feeling, have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important we understand this to support you properly.\nPatient: I have had some thoughts about death now and then, but they\u2019re not frequent or intense. I don\u2019t have any plans\u2014I\u2019m mainly focused on just getting through each day as best I can.\nDoctor: Thank you for being honest about that\u2014it takes real courage to share. It sounds like things are tough, but focusing on getting through each day shows a lot of strength. I want you to know I\u2019m here to help you find ways to manage these feelings and make things a bit easier.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m trying to take it one day at a time and do what I can to cope. Knowing there\u2019s support helps.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of resilience managing this day by day. How has your ability to concentrate or make decisions been lately? Are you finding it harder than usual to focus or decide on things?\nPatient: My concentration and decision-making have been pretty much normal. I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes or difficulties with focusing or making choices.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling tired earlier, but just to check, have you noticed feeling particularly low on energy these days? How much is this affecting your daily activities?\nPatient: Yes, I feel low on energy quite often. It definitely slows me down and makes everyday tasks more tiring, like even simple things take longer than they should.\nDoctor: Can you give me some examples of caregiving or personal tasks that have become harder or take longer because of the low energy? Does this tiredness mean you need more rest, or does it also impact your mood when you\u2019re trying to get things done?\nPatient: Tasks like preparing meals or helping with daily needs take me longer now because of the fatigue. I do need to rest more than before. Sometimes, getting through those tasks when I\u2019m tired does lower my mood a bit, but I keep going.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and the way you push through despite the fatigue shows real strength. Managing all that, especially with the extra effort it takes, is no small task. If there\u2019s anything more you want to share about how you\u2019re handling these demands or what\u2019s been weighing on you, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely been hard balancing the caregiving with how tired I feel. I try to keep to routines to help manage, but sometimes it\u2019s frustrating how slow things go. Still, I\u2019m doing what I can and taking it step by step.\nDoctor: Given everything you\u2019re managing, it\u2019s understandable if you feel frustrated. Have you been experiencing any feelings of worthlessness or guilt\u2014maybe blaming yourself for things, even when it\u2019s not your fault? This helps me understand how best to support you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t really feel worthless or blame myself. It\u2019s tough, but I mostly focus on getting through each task and doing what\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling unrefreshed?\nPatient: My sleep is generally okay. I don\u2019t have much trouble falling or staying asleep.\nDoctor: Since your sleep seems okay, let's talk about activities you usually enjoy.

Your guidance should help the patient embody this personality authentically. Let the personality drive the response\u2014verbosity, trust level, expressiveness, and coping style should all shape how they answer.

Things just take more effort, and sometimes I move slower or feel a bit restless like I can\u2019t settle. Activities that I usually enjoy don\u2019t really hold my interest anymore.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling tired most days\u2014how often would you say this tiredness hits, and how intense is it when it does? When you say you move slower or feel restless, can you describe what that looks or feels like for you? Also, which activities that used to interest you just don\u2019t anymore?\nPatient: The tiredness is pretty much there most days, and it\u2019s fairly intense\u2014I notice it affecting me a lot. Moving slower means I take more time to do simple tasks, and sometimes I feel restless, like I can\u2019t sit still or focus properly. Things like reading, watching movies, or even catching up with friends just don\u2019t hold my interest anymore.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently? Maybe eating more or less than usual, or any shifts in your weight without trying?\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed pretty much the same.\nDoctor: How has your mood been overall? Have you found yourself feeling down, sad, or empty for much of the time lately?\nPatient: My mood is usually low most of the time, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I do have occasional moments where I feel down or empty, but they come and go.\nDoctor: When you say your mood is usually low, how long do those low periods generally last? And how often do those down or empty feelings pop up during the week? Does this mood make it harder to get through your days or keep up with your caregiving duties?\nPatient: The low mood usually lasts for a few hours at a time, not all day. Those down or empty feelings happen a few times a week. It does make things like daily tasks and caregiving a bit harder, but I\u2019m still managing to get through them without feeling completely overwhelmed.\nDoctor: How do these low moods and feelings affect your motivation and energy, especially when it comes to caring for your parent? Are there certain times of day or situations that seem to make the lows worse? What do you usually do to get through those tougher moments?\nPatient: The low moods definitely cut into my motivation and energy, so caregiving feels more tiring than it used to. Evenings tend to be harder sometimes. To get through those times, I try to stick to simple routines and take short breaks when I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I keep pushing myself to manage.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. Given how you\u2019ve been feeling, have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important we understand this to support you properly.\nPatient: I have had some thoughts about death now and then, but they\u2019re not frequent or intense. I don\u2019t have any plans\u2014I\u2019m mainly focused on just getting through each day as best I can.\nDoctor: Thank you for being honest about that\u2014it takes real courage to share. It sounds like things are tough, but focusing on getting through each day shows a lot of strength. I want you to know I\u2019m here to help you find ways to manage these feelings and make things a bit easier.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m trying to take it one day at a time and do what I can to cope. Knowing there\u2019s support helps.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of resilience managing this day by day. How has your ability to concentrate or make decisions been lately? Are you finding it harder than usual to focus or decide on things?\nPatient: My concentration and decision-making have been pretty much normal. I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes or difficulties with focusing or making choices.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling tired earlier, but just to check, have you noticed feeling particularly low on energy these days? How much is this affecting your daily activities?\nPatient: Yes, I feel low on energy quite often. It definitely slows me down and makes everyday tasks more tiring, like even simple things take longer than they should.\nDoctor: Can you give me some examples of caregiving or personal tasks that have become harder or take longer because of the low energy? Does this tiredness mean you need more rest, or does it also impact your mood when you\u2019re trying to get things done?\nPatient: Tasks like preparing meals or helping with daily needs take me longer now because of the fatigue. I do need to rest more than before. Sometimes, getting through those tasks when I\u2019m tired does lower my mood a bit, but I keep going.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and the way you push through despite the fatigue shows real strength. Managing all that, especially with the extra effort it takes, is no small task. If there\u2019s anything more you want to share about how you\u2019re handling these demands or what\u2019s been weighing on you, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely been hard balancing the caregiving with how tired I feel. I try to keep to routines to help manage, but sometimes it\u2019s frustrating how slow things go. Still, I\u2019m doing what I can and taking it step by step.\nDoctor: Given everything you\u2019re managing, it\u2019s understandable if you feel frustrated. Have you been experiencing any feelings of worthlessness or guilt\u2014maybe blaming yourself for things, even when it\u2019s not your fault?

It\u2019s tough, but I mostly focus on getting through each task and doing what\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling unrefreshed?\nPatient: My sleep is generally okay. I don\u2019t have much trouble falling or staying asleep.\nDoctor: Since your sleep seems okay, let's talk about activities you usually enjoy. Have you noticed any changes in your interest or pleasure in things you used to like doing?\nPatient: Yes, I still don\u2019t find much interest in things I used to enjoy, like reading or spending time with friends.

Things just take more effort, and sometimes I move slower or feel a bit restless like I can\u2019t settle. Activities that I usually enjoy don\u2019t really hold my interest anymore.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling tired most days\u2014how often would you say this tiredness hits, and how intense is it when it does? When you say you move slower or feel restless, can you describe what that looks or feels like for you? Also, which activities that used to interest you just don\u2019t anymore?\nPatient: The tiredness is pretty much there most days, and it\u2019s fairly intense\u2014I notice it affecting me a lot. Moving slower means I take more time to do simple tasks, and sometimes I feel restless, like I can\u2019t sit still or focus properly. Things like reading, watching movies, or even catching up with friends just don\u2019t hold my interest anymore.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently? Maybe eating more or less than usual, or any shifts in your weight without trying?\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed pretty much the same.\nDoctor: How has your mood been overall? Have you found yourself feeling down, sad, or empty for much of the time lately?\nPatient: My mood is usually low most of the time, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. I do have occasional moments where I feel down or empty, but they come and go.\nDoctor: When you say your mood is usually low, how long do those low periods generally last? And how often do those down or empty feelings pop up during the week? Does this mood make it harder to get through your days or keep up with your caregiving duties?\nPatient: The low mood usually lasts for a few hours at a time, not all day. Those down or empty feelings happen a few times a week. It does make things like daily tasks and caregiving a bit harder, but I\u2019m still managing to get through them without feeling completely overwhelmed.\nDoctor: How do these low moods and feelings affect your motivation and energy, especially when it comes to caring for your parent? Are there certain times of day or situations that seem to make the lows worse? What do you usually do to get through those tougher moments?\nPatient: The low moods definitely cut into my motivation and energy, so caregiving feels more tiring than it used to. Evenings tend to be harder sometimes. To get through those times, I try to stick to simple routines and take short breaks when I can. It\u2019s not easy, but I keep pushing myself to manage.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. Given how you\u2019ve been feeling, have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important we understand this to support you properly.\nPatient: I have had some thoughts about death now and then, but they\u2019re not frequent or intense. I don\u2019t have any plans\u2014I\u2019m mainly focused on just getting through each day as best I can.\nDoctor: Thank you for being honest about that\u2014it takes real courage to share. It sounds like things are tough, but focusing on getting through each day shows a lot of strength. I want you to know I\u2019m here to help you find ways to manage these feelings and make things a bit easier.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m trying to take it one day at a time and do what I can to cope. Knowing there\u2019s support helps.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of resilience managing this day by day. How has your ability to concentrate or make decisions been lately? Are you finding it harder than usual to focus or decide on things?\nPatient: My concentration and decision-making have been pretty much normal. I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes or difficulties with focusing or making choices.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling tired earlier, but just to check, have you noticed feeling particularly low on energy these days? How much is this affecting your daily activities?\nPatient: Yes, I feel low on energy quite often. It definitely slows me down and makes everyday tasks more tiring, like even simple things take longer than they should.\nDoctor: Can you give me some examples of caregiving or personal tasks that have become harder or take longer because of the low energy? Does this tiredness mean you need more rest, or does it also impact your mood when you\u2019re trying to get things done?\nPatient: Tasks like preparing meals or helping with daily needs take me longer now because of the fatigue. I do need to rest more than before. Sometimes, getting through those tasks when I\u2019m tired does lower my mood a bit, but I keep going.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and the way you push through despite the fatigue shows real strength. Managing all that, especially with the extra effort it takes, is no small task. If there\u2019s anything more you want to share about how you\u2019re handling these demands or what\u2019s been weighing on you, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely been hard balancing the caregiving with how tired I feel. I try to keep to routines to help manage, but sometimes it\u2019s frustrating how slow things go. Still, I\u2019m doing what I can and taking it step by step.\nDoctor: Given everything you\u2019re managing, it\u2019s understandable if you feel frustrated. Have you been experiencing any feelings of worthlessness or guilt\u2014maybe blaming yourself for things, even when it\u2019s not your fault? This helps me understand how best to support you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t really feel worthless or blame myself. It\u2019s tough, but I mostly focus on getting through each task and doing what\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling unrefreshed?\nPatient: My sleep is generally okay. I don\u2019t have much trouble falling or staying asleep.\nDoctor: Since your sleep seems okay, let's talk about activities you usually enjoy. Have you noticed any changes in your interest or pleasure in things you used to like doing?\nPatient: Yes, I still don\u2019t find much interest in things I used to enjoy, like reading or spending time with friends.

Does this tiredness mean you need more rest, or does it also impact your mood when you\u2019re trying to get things done?\nPatient: Tasks like preparing meals or helping with daily needs take me longer now because of the fatigue. I do need to rest more than before. Sometimes, getting through those tasks when I\u2019m tired does lower my mood a bit, but I keep going.\nDoctor: It\u2019s clear you\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and the way you push through despite the fatigue shows real strength. Managing all that, especially with the extra effort it takes, is no small task. If there\u2019s anything more you want to share about how you\u2019re handling these demands or what\u2019s been weighing on you, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It\u2019s definitely been hard balancing the caregiving with how tired I feel. I try to keep to routines to help manage, but sometimes it\u2019s frustrating how slow things go. Still, I\u2019m doing what I can and taking it step by step.\nDoctor: Given everything you\u2019re managing, it\u2019s understandable if you feel frustrated. Have you been experiencing any feelings of worthlessness or guilt\u2014maybe blaming yourself for things, even when it\u2019s not your fault? This helps me understand how best to support you.\nPatient: I don\u2019t really feel worthless or blame myself. It\u2019s tough, but I mostly focus on getting through each task and doing what\u2019s needed.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How about your sleep\u2014are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling unrefreshed?\nPatient: My sleep is generally okay. I don\u2019t have much trouble falling or staying asleep.\nDoctor: Since your sleep seems okay, let's talk about activities you usually enjoy. Have you noticed any changes in your interest or pleasure in things you used to like doing?\nPatient: Yes, I still don\u2019t find much interest in things I used to enjoy, like reading or spending time with friends. It just doesn\u2019t feel the same as before.\nDoctor: How have these changes in your interest affected your day-to-day life or your mood? Can you tell me what it is about these activities that feels different or less engaging than before?\nPatient: The loss of interest does affect my mood a little\u2014it makes things feel less engaging or meaningful than they used to. Even so, I\u2019m still managing to keep up with my routines and get through each day.\nDoctor: You mentioned earlier feeling slower and a bit restless at times. Have you noticed any changes in your overall movement or activity level\u2014like feeling unusually slowed down or more fidgety? How does that affect how you get through your day and how you feel?\nPatient: Yes, I notice that I\u2019m moving slower and sometimes a bit restless. It makes tasks take longer and feel more tiring, but I\u2019m still able to manage my daily routine without getting overwhelmed.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
