Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

My sleep\u2019s been a problem; I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up more than I should. On top of that, I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m either really restless or, at times, moving slower than usual. It\u2019s been hard to settle into a regular rhythm.\nDoctor: You mentioned trouble falling asleep and waking up a lot\u2014how many nights a week would you say that happens? And when you\u2019re restless or moving slower, is that more of a physical sensation, like pacing or fidgeting, or something mental, like feeling agitated or slowed down in your thoughts? How much are these sleep and movement changes getting in the way of your day-to-day routine?\nPatient: I\u2019d say the sleep issues happen around four to five nights a week. It\u2019s mostly that I can\u2019t fall asleep right away and then I wake up a bunch during the night, which makes it hard to get good rest. As for the restlessness, it\u2019s mostly physical for me\u2014like pacing around or fiddling with things without really meaning to. The slowing down is different; sometimes my thoughts feel like they drag or move slower than usual, which can make even simple decisions take more effort. These things do interfere with my daily routine; I don\u2019t stop doing what I need to, but it definitely makes things tougher than they should be.\nDoctor: I appreciate the clear picture you\u2019re giving\u2014it sounds like those sleep disturbances and the mix of restlessness and slowed thinking really weigh on you. Given that, how often do you feel tired or drained during your day, even when you push through your routine?\nPatient: I do feel tired pretty regularly throughout the day, but it\u2019s usually manageable. It doesn\u2019t completely knock me out or anything, so I\u2019m still able to get through my daily tasks and responsibilities. It\u2019s more like a background drag that\u2019s there, but I keep pushing through it.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying a steady load of fatigue but still managing to keep things moving.

It\u2019s been hard to settle into a regular rhythm.\nDoctor: You mentioned trouble falling asleep and waking up a lot\u2014how many nights a week would you say that happens? And when you\u2019re restless or moving slower, is that more of a physical sensation, like pacing or fidgeting, or something mental, like feeling agitated or slowed down in your thoughts? How much are these sleep and movement changes getting in the way of your day-to-day routine?\nPatient: I\u2019d say the sleep issues happen around four to five nights a week. It\u2019s mostly that I can\u2019t fall asleep right away and then I wake up a bunch during the night, which makes it hard to get good rest. As for the restlessness, it\u2019s mostly physical for me\u2014like pacing around or fiddling with things without really meaning to. The slowing down is different; sometimes my thoughts feel like they drag or move slower than usual, which can make even simple decisions take more effort. These things do interfere with my daily routine; I don\u2019t stop doing what I need to, but it definitely makes things tougher than they should be.\nDoctor: I appreciate the clear picture you\u2019re giving\u2014it sounds like those sleep disturbances and the mix of restlessness and slowed thinking really weigh on you. Given that, how often do you feel tired or drained during your day, even when you push through your routine?\nPatient: I do feel tired pretty regularly throughout the day, but it\u2019s usually manageable. It doesn\u2019t completely knock me out or anything, so I\u2019m still able to get through my daily tasks and responsibilities. It\u2019s more like a background drag that\u2019s there, but I keep pushing through it.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying a steady load of fatigue but still managing to keep things moving. Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately, and if so, how would you describe their impact on you day to day?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling some worthlessness and guilt here and there. It\u2019s not overwhelming or constant, but it\u2019s definitely there enough to make some decisions harder and slow me down at times. It\u2019s like an extra weight, but one I\u2019ve gotten somewhat used to dealing with while still handling daily stuff.\nDoctor: You mentioned that these feelings come up now and then and weigh on you\u2014how often would you say they happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of making decisions or getting tasks done? It\u2019s common for these kinds of feelings to slow things down, even if they aren\u2019t constant or crippling.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nYou mentioned that these feelings come up now and then and weigh on you\u2014how often would you say they happen?

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. Lately, I\u2019ve just been feeling kind of down most days\u2014nothing too extreme, but consistently off. My sleep\u2019s been a problem; I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up more than I should. On top of that, I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m either really restless or, at times, moving slower than usual. It\u2019s been hard to settle into a regular rhythm.\nDoctor: You mentioned trouble falling asleep and waking up a lot\u2014how many nights a week would you say that happens? And when you\u2019re restless or moving slower, is that more of a physical sensation, like pacing or fidgeting, or something mental, like feeling agitated or slowed down in your thoughts? How much are these sleep and movement changes getting in the way of your day-to-day routine?\nPatient: I\u2019d say the sleep issues happen around four to five nights a week. It\u2019s mostly that I can\u2019t fall asleep right away and then I wake up a bunch during the night, which makes it hard to get good rest. As for the restlessness, it\u2019s mostly physical for me\u2014like pacing around or fiddling with things without really meaning to. The slowing down is different; sometimes my thoughts feel like they drag or move slower than usual, which can make even simple decisions take more effort. These things do interfere with my daily routine; I don\u2019t stop doing what I need to, but it definitely makes things tougher than they should be.\nDoctor: I appreciate the clear picture you\u2019re giving\u2014it sounds like those sleep disturbances and the mix of restlessness and slowed thinking really weigh on you. Given that, how often do you feel tired or drained during your day, even when you push through your routine?\nPatient: I do feel tired pretty regularly throughout the day, but it\u2019s usually manageable. It doesn\u2019t completely knock me out or anything, so I\u2019m still able to get through my daily tasks and responsibilities. It\u2019s more like a background drag that\u2019s there, but I keep pushing through it.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying a steady load of fatigue but still managing to keep things moving. Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately, and if so, how would you describe their impact on you day to day?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling some worthlessness and guilt here and there. It\u2019s not overwhelming or constant, but it\u2019s definitely there enough to make some decisions harder and slow me down at times. It\u2019s like an extra weight, but one I\u2019ve gotten somewhat used to dealing with while still handling daily stuff.\nDoctor: You mentioned that these feelings come up now and then and weigh on you\u2014how often would you say they happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of making decisions or getting tasks done? It\u2019s common for these kinds of feelings to slow things down, even if they aren\u2019t constant or crippling.\nPatient: They come up a few times a week, not every day but often enough to notice. When they do show up, they definitely slow me down a bit\u2014making decisions take longer and making some tasks harder to finish smoothly. Still, I manage to keep up with my routine, even if it takes a bit more effort when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I need to ask directly\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide? It\u2019s important to know so we can make sure you\u2019re safe and get you the right support.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death from time to time. They\u2019re there, but I wouldn\u2019t say they take over my mind or anything like that. Even when those thoughts come up, I still manage to keep up with my basic routine and responsibilities.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. Lately, I\u2019ve just been feeling kind of down most days\u2014nothing too extreme, but consistently off. My sleep\u2019s been a problem; I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up more than I should. On top of that, I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m either really restless or, at times, moving slower than usual. It\u2019s been hard to settle into a regular rhythm.\nDoctor: You mentioned trouble falling asleep and waking up a lot\u2014how many nights a week would you say that happens? And when you\u2019re restless or moving slower, is that more of a physical sensation, like pacing or fidgeting, or something mental, like feeling agitated or slowed down in your thoughts? How much are these sleep and movement changes getting in the way of your day-to-day routine?\nPatient: I\u2019d say the sleep issues happen around four to five nights a week. It\u2019s mostly that I can\u2019t fall asleep right away and then I wake up a bunch during the night, which makes it hard to get good rest. As for the restlessness, it\u2019s mostly physical for me\u2014like pacing around or fiddling with things without really meaning to. The slowing down is different; sometimes my thoughts feel like they drag or move slower than usual, which can make even simple decisions take more effort. These things do interfere with my daily routine; I don\u2019t stop doing what I need to, but it definitely makes things tougher than they should be.\nDoctor: I appreciate the clear picture you\u2019re giving\u2014it sounds like those sleep disturbances and the mix of restlessness and slowed thinking really weigh on you. Given that, how often do you feel tired or drained during your day, even when you push through your routine?\nPatient: I do feel tired pretty regularly throughout the day, but it\u2019s usually manageable. It doesn\u2019t completely knock me out or anything, so I\u2019m still able to get through my daily tasks and responsibilities. It\u2019s more like a background drag that\u2019s there, but I keep pushing through it.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying a steady load of fatigue but still managing to keep things moving. Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately, and if so, how would you describe their impact on you day to day?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling some worthlessness and guilt here and there. It\u2019s not overwhelming or constant, but it\u2019s definitely there enough to make some decisions harder and slow me down at times. It\u2019s like an extra weight, but one I\u2019ve gotten somewhat used to dealing with while still handling daily stuff.\nDoctor: You mentioned that these feelings come up now and then and weigh on you\u2014how often would you say they happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of making decisions or getting tasks done? It\u2019s common for these kinds of feelings to slow things down, even if they aren\u2019t constant or crippling.\nPatient: They come up a few times a week, not every day but often enough to notice. When they do show up, they definitely slow me down a bit\u2014making decisions take longer and making some tasks harder to finish smoothly. Still, I manage to keep up with my routine, even if it takes a bit more effort when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I need to ask directly\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide? It\u2019s important to know so we can make sure you\u2019re safe and get you the right support.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death from time to time. They\u2019re there, but I wouldn\u2019t say they take over my mind or anything like that. Even when those thoughts come up, I still manage to keep up with my basic routine and responsibilities. It\u2019s not easy, but I push through.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that. Can you tell me how often these thoughts about death come up and what usually brings them on? Have you had any specific plans or feelings that make you think about acting on those thoughts? Being honest here helps me keep you safe and get you the right help.\nPatient: Those thoughts come up a few times a week, mostly when I\u2019m feeling really overwhelmed or like I\u2019m stuck in a situation I can\u2019t get out of.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. Lately, I\u2019ve just been feeling kind of down most days\u2014nothing too extreme, but consistently off. My sleep\u2019s been a problem; I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up more than I should. On top of that, I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m either really restless or, at times, moving slower than usual. It\u2019s been hard to settle into a regular rhythm.\nDoctor: You mentioned trouble falling asleep and waking up a lot\u2014how many nights a week would you say that happens? And when you\u2019re restless or moving slower, is that more of a physical sensation, like pacing or fidgeting, or something mental, like feeling agitated or slowed down in your thoughts? How much are these sleep and movement changes getting in the way of your day-to-day routine?\nPatient: I\u2019d say the sleep issues happen around four to five nights a week. It\u2019s mostly that I can\u2019t fall asleep right away and then I wake up a bunch during the night, which makes it hard to get good rest. As for the restlessness, it\u2019s mostly physical for me\u2014like pacing around or fiddling with things without really meaning to. The slowing down is different; sometimes my thoughts feel like they drag or move slower than usual, which can make even simple decisions take more effort. These things do interfere with my daily routine; I don\u2019t stop doing what I need to, but it definitely makes things tougher than they should be.\nDoctor: I appreciate the clear picture you\u2019re giving\u2014it sounds like those sleep disturbances and the mix of restlessness and slowed thinking really weigh on you. Given that, how often do you feel tired or drained during your day, even when you push through your routine?\nPatient: I do feel tired pretty regularly throughout the day, but it\u2019s usually manageable. It doesn\u2019t completely knock me out or anything, so I\u2019m still able to get through my daily tasks and responsibilities. It\u2019s more like a background drag that\u2019s there, but I keep pushing through it.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying a steady load of fatigue but still managing to keep things moving. Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately, and if so, how would you describe their impact on you day to day?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling some worthlessness and guilt here and there. It\u2019s not overwhelming or constant, but it\u2019s definitely there enough to make some decisions harder and slow me down at times. It\u2019s like an extra weight, but one I\u2019ve gotten somewhat used to dealing with while still handling daily stuff.\nDoctor: You mentioned that these feelings come up now and then and weigh on you\u2014how often would you say they happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of making decisions or getting tasks done? It\u2019s common for these kinds of feelings to slow things down, even if they aren\u2019t constant or crippling.\nPatient: They come up a few times a week, not every day but often enough to notice. When they do show up, they definitely slow me down a bit\u2014making decisions take longer and making some tasks harder to finish smoothly. Still, I manage to keep up with my routine, even if it takes a bit more effort when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I need to ask directly\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide? It\u2019s important to know so we can make sure you\u2019re safe and get you the right support.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death from time to time. They\u2019re there, but I wouldn\u2019t say they take over my mind or anything like that. Even when those thoughts come up, I still manage to keep up with my basic routine and responsibilities. It\u2019s not easy, but I push through.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that. Can you tell me how often these thoughts about death come up and what usually brings them on? Have you had any specific plans or feelings that make you think about acting on those thoughts? Being honest here helps me keep you safe and get you the right help.\nPatient: Those thoughts come up a few times a week, mostly when I\u2019m feeling really overwhelmed or like I\u2019m stuck in a situation I can\u2019t get out of. But no, I don\u2019t have any plans or intentions to act on those thoughts. It\u2019s more like they\u2019re there as a sort of background thing, not something I\u2019m moving toward.\nDoctor: Got it. Now, let\u2019s shift focus\u2014have you noticed any changes in your interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy? It\u2019s important to understand how all these symptoms fit together.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed that some things I used to enjoy don\u2019t really grab my attention the same way anymore.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. Lately, I\u2019ve just been feeling kind of down most days\u2014nothing too extreme, but consistently off. My sleep\u2019s been a problem; I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up more than I should. On top of that, I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m either really restless or, at times, moving slower than usual. It\u2019s been hard to settle into a regular rhythm.\nDoctor: You mentioned trouble falling asleep and waking up a lot\u2014how many nights a week would you say that happens? And when you\u2019re restless or moving slower, is that more of a physical sensation, like pacing or fidgeting, or something mental, like feeling agitated or slowed down in your thoughts? How much are these sleep and movement changes getting in the way of your day-to-day routine?\nPatient: I\u2019d say the sleep issues happen around four to five nights a week. It\u2019s mostly that I can\u2019t fall asleep right away and then I wake up a bunch during the night, which makes it hard to get good rest. As for the restlessness, it\u2019s mostly physical for me\u2014like pacing around or fiddling with things without really meaning to. The slowing down is different; sometimes my thoughts feel like they drag or move slower than usual, which can make even simple decisions take more effort. These things do interfere with my daily routine; I don\u2019t stop doing what I need to, but it definitely makes things tougher than they should be.\nDoctor: I appreciate the clear picture you\u2019re giving\u2014it sounds like those sleep disturbances and the mix of restlessness and slowed thinking really weigh on you. Given that, how often do you feel tired or drained during your day, even when you push through your routine?\nPatient: I do feel tired pretty regularly throughout the day, but it\u2019s usually manageable. It doesn\u2019t completely knock me out or anything, so I\u2019m still able to get through my daily tasks and responsibilities. It\u2019s more like a background drag that\u2019s there, but I keep pushing through it.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying a steady load of fatigue but still managing to keep things moving. Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately, and if so, how would you describe their impact on you day to day?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling some worthlessness and guilt here and there. It\u2019s not overwhelming or constant, but it\u2019s definitely there enough to make some decisions harder and slow me down at times. It\u2019s like an extra weight, but one I\u2019ve gotten somewhat used to dealing with while still handling daily stuff.\nDoctor: You mentioned that these feelings come up now and then and weigh on you\u2014how often would you say they happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of making decisions or getting tasks done? It\u2019s common for these kinds of feelings to slow things down, even if they aren\u2019t constant or crippling.\nPatient: They come up a few times a week, not every day but often enough to notice. When they do show up, they definitely slow me down a bit\u2014making decisions take longer and making some tasks harder to finish smoothly. Still, I manage to keep up with my routine, even if it takes a bit more effort when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I need to ask directly\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide? It\u2019s important to know so we can make sure you\u2019re safe and get you the right support.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death from time to time. They\u2019re there, but I wouldn\u2019t say they take over my mind or anything like that. Even when those thoughts come up, I still manage to keep up with my basic routine and responsibilities. It\u2019s not easy, but I push through.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that. Can you tell me how often these thoughts about death come up and what usually brings them on? Have you had any specific plans or feelings that make you think about acting on those thoughts? Being honest here helps me keep you safe and get you the right help.\nPatient: Those thoughts come up a few times a week, mostly when I\u2019m feeling really overwhelmed or like I\u2019m stuck in a situation I can\u2019t get out of. But no, I don\u2019t have any plans or intentions to act on those thoughts. It\u2019s more like they\u2019re there as a sort of background thing, not something I\u2019m moving toward.\nDoctor: Got it. Now, let\u2019s shift focus\u2014have you noticed any changes in your interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy? It\u2019s important to understand how all these symptoms fit together.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed that some things I used to enjoy don\u2019t really grab my attention the same way anymore. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s completely gone, but there\u2019s definitely less pleasure or motivation to do those activities. It\u2019s enough to notice, but it doesn\u2019t take over everything.\nDoctor: You\u2019re noticing less motivation and enjoyment, even if it\u2019s not total loss\u2014thanks for sharing that. How about your mood overall\u2014do you feel sad or down most of the day, more often than not?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019d say I feel down pretty regularly.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. Lately, I\u2019ve just been feeling kind of down most days\u2014nothing too extreme, but consistently off. My sleep\u2019s been a problem; I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up more than I should. On top of that, I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m either really restless or, at times, moving slower than usual. It\u2019s been hard to settle into a regular rhythm.\nDoctor: You mentioned trouble falling asleep and waking up a lot\u2014how many nights a week would you say that happens? And when you\u2019re restless or moving slower, is that more of a physical sensation, like pacing or fidgeting, or something mental, like feeling agitated or slowed down in your thoughts? How much are these sleep and movement changes getting in the way of your day-to-day routine?\nPatient: I\u2019d say the sleep issues happen around four to five nights a week. It\u2019s mostly that I can\u2019t fall asleep right away and then I wake up a bunch during the night, which makes it hard to get good rest. As for the restlessness, it\u2019s mostly physical for me\u2014like pacing around or fiddling with things without really meaning to. The slowing down is different; sometimes my thoughts feel like they drag or move slower than usual, which can make even simple decisions take more effort. These things do interfere with my daily routine; I don\u2019t stop doing what I need to, but it definitely makes things tougher than they should be.\nDoctor: I appreciate the clear picture you\u2019re giving\u2014it sounds like those sleep disturbances and the mix of restlessness and slowed thinking really weigh on you. Given that, how often do you feel tired or drained during your day, even when you push through your routine?\nPatient: I do feel tired pretty regularly throughout the day, but it\u2019s usually manageable. It doesn\u2019t completely knock me out or anything, so I\u2019m still able to get through my daily tasks and responsibilities. It\u2019s more like a background drag that\u2019s there, but I keep pushing through it.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying a steady load of fatigue but still managing to keep things moving. Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately, and if so, how would you describe their impact on you day to day?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling some worthlessness and guilt here and there. It\u2019s not overwhelming or constant, but it\u2019s definitely there enough to make some decisions harder and slow me down at times. It\u2019s like an extra weight, but one I\u2019ve gotten somewhat used to dealing with while still handling daily stuff.\nDoctor: You mentioned that these feelings come up now and then and weigh on you\u2014how often would you say they happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of making decisions or getting tasks done? It\u2019s common for these kinds of feelings to slow things down, even if they aren\u2019t constant or crippling.\nPatient: They come up a few times a week, not every day but often enough to notice. When they do show up, they definitely slow me down a bit\u2014making decisions take longer and making some tasks harder to finish smoothly. Still, I manage to keep up with my routine, even if it takes a bit more effort when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I need to ask directly\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide? It\u2019s important to know so we can make sure you\u2019re safe and get you the right support.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death from time to time. They\u2019re there, but I wouldn\u2019t say they take over my mind or anything like that. Even when those thoughts come up, I still manage to keep up with my basic routine and responsibilities. It\u2019s not easy, but I push through.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that. Can you tell me how often these thoughts about death come up and what usually brings them on? Have you had any specific plans or feelings that make you think about acting on those thoughts? Being honest here helps me keep you safe and get you the right help.\nPatient: Those thoughts come up a few times a week, mostly when I\u2019m feeling really overwhelmed or like I\u2019m stuck in a situation I can\u2019t get out of. But no, I don\u2019t have any plans or intentions to act on those thoughts. It\u2019s more like they\u2019re there as a sort of background thing, not something I\u2019m moving toward.\nDoctor: Got it. Now, let\u2019s shift focus\u2014have you noticed any changes in your interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy? It\u2019s important to understand how all these symptoms fit together.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed that some things I used to enjoy don\u2019t really grab my attention the same way anymore. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s completely gone, but there\u2019s definitely less pleasure or motivation to do those activities. It\u2019s enough to notice, but it doesn\u2019t take over everything.\nDoctor: You\u2019re noticing less motivation and enjoyment, even if it\u2019s not total loss\u2014thanks for sharing that. How about your mood overall\u2014do you feel sad or down most of the day, more often than not?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019d say I feel down pretty regularly. It\u2019s not something that completely takes over my day, but it\u2019s there most of the time. It definitely affects how I function, making things harder, but I\u2019m still able to get through my daily responsibilities.\nDoctor: You\u2019re feeling down most days and it\u2019s making functioning tougher. How about concentrating or making decisions\u2014have those been more difficult lately? How is that impacting your ability to get tasks done?\nPatient: Yeah, concentrating and making decisions have been a bit more difficult recently.

It\u2019s not easy, but I push through.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that. Can you tell me how often these thoughts about death come up and what usually brings them on? Have you had any specific plans or feelings that make you think about acting on those thoughts? Being honest here helps me keep you safe and get you the right help.\nPatient: Those thoughts come up a few times a week, mostly when I\u2019m feeling really overwhelmed or like I\u2019m stuck in a situation I can\u2019t get out of. But no, I don\u2019t have any plans or intentions to act on those thoughts. It\u2019s more like they\u2019re there as a sort of background thing, not something I\u2019m moving toward.\nDoctor: Got it. Now, let\u2019s shift focus\u2014have you noticed any changes in your interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy? It\u2019s important to understand how all these symptoms fit together.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed that some things I used to enjoy don\u2019t really grab my attention the same way anymore. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s completely gone, but there\u2019s definitely less pleasure or motivation to do those activities. It\u2019s enough to notice, but it doesn\u2019t take over everything.\nDoctor: You\u2019re noticing less motivation and enjoyment, even if it\u2019s not total loss\u2014thanks for sharing that. How about your mood overall\u2014do you feel sad or down most of the day, more often than not?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019d say I feel down pretty regularly. It\u2019s not something that completely takes over my day, but it\u2019s there most of the time. It definitely affects how I function, making things harder, but I\u2019m still able to get through my daily responsibilities.\nDoctor: You\u2019re feeling down most days and it\u2019s making functioning tougher. How about concentrating or making decisions\u2014have those been more difficult lately? How is that impacting your ability to get tasks done?\nPatient: Yeah, concentrating and making decisions have been a bit more difficult recently. It\u2019s noticeable enough that it slows me down sometimes when I\u2019m trying to finish tasks, but it doesn\u2019t stop me from getting things done. I just have to work a little harder to stay focused.\nDoctor: How often do you find yourself struggling with concentration and decision-making? Is it a constant issue, or does it come and go? And when it happens, how much does it affect the quality of your work or your overall functioning during the day?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nHow often do you find yourself struggling with concentration and decision-making?

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. Lately, I\u2019ve just been feeling kind of down most days\u2014nothing too extreme, but consistently off. My sleep\u2019s been a problem; I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up more than I should. On top of that, I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m either really restless or, at times, moving slower than usual. It\u2019s been hard to settle into a regular rhythm.\nDoctor: You mentioned trouble falling asleep and waking up a lot\u2014how many nights a week would you say that happens? And when you\u2019re restless or moving slower, is that more of a physical sensation, like pacing or fidgeting, or something mental, like feeling agitated or slowed down in your thoughts? How much are these sleep and movement changes getting in the way of your day-to-day routine?\nPatient: I\u2019d say the sleep issues happen around four to five nights a week. It\u2019s mostly that I can\u2019t fall asleep right away and then I wake up a bunch during the night, which makes it hard to get good rest. As for the restlessness, it\u2019s mostly physical for me\u2014like pacing around or fiddling with things without really meaning to. The slowing down is different; sometimes my thoughts feel like they drag or move slower than usual, which can make even simple decisions take more effort. These things do interfere with my daily routine; I don\u2019t stop doing what I need to, but it definitely makes things tougher than they should be.\nDoctor: I appreciate the clear picture you\u2019re giving\u2014it sounds like those sleep disturbances and the mix of restlessness and slowed thinking really weigh on you. Given that, how often do you feel tired or drained during your day, even when you push through your routine?\nPatient: I do feel tired pretty regularly throughout the day, but it\u2019s usually manageable. It doesn\u2019t completely knock me out or anything, so I\u2019m still able to get through my daily tasks and responsibilities. It\u2019s more like a background drag that\u2019s there, but I keep pushing through it.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying a steady load of fatigue but still managing to keep things moving. Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately, and if so, how would you describe their impact on you day to day?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling some worthlessness and guilt here and there. It\u2019s not overwhelming or constant, but it\u2019s definitely there enough to make some decisions harder and slow me down at times. It\u2019s like an extra weight, but one I\u2019ve gotten somewhat used to dealing with while still handling daily stuff.\nDoctor: You mentioned that these feelings come up now and then and weigh on you\u2014how often would you say they happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of making decisions or getting tasks done? It\u2019s common for these kinds of feelings to slow things down, even if they aren\u2019t constant or crippling.\nPatient: They come up a few times a week, not every day but often enough to notice. When they do show up, they definitely slow me down a bit\u2014making decisions take longer and making some tasks harder to finish smoothly. Still, I manage to keep up with my routine, even if it takes a bit more effort when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I need to ask directly\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide? It\u2019s important to know so we can make sure you\u2019re safe and get you the right support.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death from time to time.

The slowing down is different; sometimes my thoughts feel like they drag or move slower than usual, which can make even simple decisions take more effort. These things do interfere with my daily routine; I don\u2019t stop doing what I need to, but it definitely makes things tougher than they should be.\nDoctor: I appreciate the clear picture you\u2019re giving\u2014it sounds like those sleep disturbances and the mix of restlessness and slowed thinking really weigh on you. Given that, how often do you feel tired or drained during your day, even when you push through your routine?\nPatient: I do feel tired pretty regularly throughout the day, but it\u2019s usually manageable. It doesn\u2019t completely knock me out or anything, so I\u2019m still able to get through my daily tasks and responsibilities. It\u2019s more like a background drag that\u2019s there, but I keep pushing through it.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying a steady load of fatigue but still managing to keep things moving. Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately, and if so, how would you describe their impact on you day to day?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling some worthlessness and guilt here and there. It\u2019s not overwhelming or constant, but it\u2019s definitely there enough to make some decisions harder and slow me down at times. It\u2019s like an extra weight, but one I\u2019ve gotten somewhat used to dealing with while still handling daily stuff.\nDoctor: You mentioned that these feelings come up now and then and weigh on you\u2014how often would you say they happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of making decisions or getting tasks done? It\u2019s common for these kinds of feelings to slow things down, even if they aren\u2019t constant or crippling.\nPatient: They come up a few times a week, not every day but often enough to notice. When they do show up, they definitely slow me down a bit\u2014making decisions take longer and making some tasks harder to finish smoothly. Still, I manage to keep up with my routine, even if it takes a bit more effort when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I need to ask directly\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide? It\u2019s important to know so we can make sure you\u2019re safe and get you the right support.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death from time to time. They\u2019re there, but I wouldn\u2019t say they take over my mind or anything like that. Even when those thoughts come up, I still manage to keep up with my basic routine and responsibilities. It\u2019s not easy, but I push through.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that. Can you tell me how often these thoughts about death come up and what usually brings them on? Have you had any specific plans or feelings that make you think about acting on those thoughts? Being honest here helps me keep you safe and get you the right help.\nPatient: Those thoughts come up a few times a week, mostly when I\u2019m feeling really overwhelmed or like I\u2019m stuck in a situation I can\u2019t get out of. But no, I don\u2019t have any plans or intentions to act on those thoughts. It\u2019s more like they\u2019re there as a sort of background thing, not something I\u2019m moving toward.\nDoctor: Got it. Now, let\u2019s shift focus\u2014have you noticed any changes in your interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy? It\u2019s important to understand how all these symptoms fit together.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed that some things I used to enjoy don\u2019t really grab my attention the same way anymore. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s completely gone, but there\u2019s definitely less pleasure or motivation to do those activities. It\u2019s enough to notice, but it doesn\u2019t take over everything.\nDoctor: You\u2019re noticing less motivation and enjoyment, even if it\u2019s not total loss\u2014thanks for sharing that. How about your mood overall\u2014do you feel sad or down most of the day, more often than not?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019d say I feel down pretty regularly. It\u2019s not something that completely takes over my day, but it\u2019s there most of the time. It definitely affects how I function, making things harder, but I\u2019m still able to get through my daily responsibilities.\nDoctor: You\u2019re feeling down most days and it\u2019s making functioning tougher. How about concentrating or making decisions\u2014have those been more difficult lately? How is that impacting your ability to get tasks done?\nPatient: Yeah, concentrating and making decisions have been a bit more difficult recently. It\u2019s noticeable enough that it slows me down sometimes when I\u2019m trying to finish tasks, but it doesn\u2019t stop me from getting things done. I just have to work a little harder to stay focused.\nDoctor: How often do you find yourself struggling with concentration and decision-making? Is it a constant issue, or does it come and go? And when it happens, how much does it affect the quality of your work or your overall functioning during the day?\nPatient: It comes and goes\u2014I don\u2019t struggle with concentration or decisions all the time, but when it happens, it definitely slows me down. It makes getting work and daily tasks done a bit harder, but I still manage to finish what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight\u2014like eating significantly more or less than usual, or any unexplained gains or losses?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nHave you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight\u2014like eating significantly more or less than usual, or any unexplained gains or losses?\n\nTask:\nDecide how the patient should respond next and output JSON only.",

My sleep\u2019s been a problem; I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up more than I should. On top of that, I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m either really restless or, at times, moving slower than usual. It\u2019s been hard to settle into a regular rhythm.\nDoctor: You mentioned trouble falling asleep and waking up a lot\u2014how many nights a week would you say that happens? And when you\u2019re restless or moving slower, is that more of a physical sensation, like pacing or fidgeting, or something mental, like feeling agitated or slowed down in your thoughts? How much are these sleep and movement changes getting in the way of your day-to-day routine?\nPatient: I\u2019d say the sleep issues happen around four to five nights a week. It\u2019s mostly that I can\u2019t fall asleep right away and then I wake up a bunch during the night, which makes it hard to get good rest.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. Lately, I\u2019ve just been feeling kind of down most days\u2014nothing too extreme, but consistently off. My sleep\u2019s been a problem; I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up more than I should. On top of that, I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m either really restless or, at times, moving slower than usual. It\u2019s been hard to settle into a regular rhythm.\nDoctor: You mentioned trouble falling asleep and waking up a lot\u2014how many nights a week would you say that happens? And when you\u2019re restless or moving slower, is that more of a physical sensation, like pacing or fidgeting, or something mental, like feeling agitated or slowed down in your thoughts? How much are these sleep and movement changes getting in the way of your day-to-day routine?\nPatient: I\u2019d say the sleep issues happen around four to five nights a week. It\u2019s mostly that I can\u2019t fall asleep right away and then I wake up a bunch during the night, which makes it hard to get good rest. As for the restlessness, it\u2019s mostly physical for me\u2014like pacing around or fiddling with things without really meaning to. The slowing down is different; sometimes my thoughts feel like they drag or move slower than usual, which can make even simple decisions take more effort. These things do interfere with my daily routine; I don\u2019t stop doing what I need to, but it definitely makes things tougher than they should be.\nDoctor: I appreciate the clear picture you\u2019re giving\u2014it sounds like those sleep disturbances and the mix of restlessness and slowed thinking really weigh on you. Given that, how often do you feel tired or drained during your day, even when you push through your routine?\nPatient: I do feel tired pretty regularly throughout the day, but it\u2019s usually manageable. It doesn\u2019t completely knock me out or anything, so I\u2019m still able to get through my daily tasks and responsibilities. It\u2019s more like a background drag that\u2019s there, but I keep pushing through it.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying a steady load of fatigue but still managing to keep things moving. Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately, and if so, how would you describe their impact on you day to day?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling some worthlessness and guilt here and there. It\u2019s not overwhelming or constant, but it\u2019s definitely there enough to make some decisions harder and slow me down at times. It\u2019s like an extra weight, but one I\u2019ve gotten somewhat used to dealing with while still handling daily stuff.\nDoctor: You mentioned that these feelings come up now and then and weigh on you\u2014how often would you say they happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of making decisions or getting tasks done? It\u2019s common for these kinds of feelings to slow things down, even if they aren\u2019t constant or crippling.\nPatient: They come up a few times a week, not every day but often enough to notice. When they do show up, they definitely slow me down a bit\u2014making decisions take longer and making some tasks harder to finish smoothly. Still, I manage to keep up with my routine, even if it takes a bit more effort when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I need to ask directly\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide? It\u2019s important to know so we can make sure you\u2019re safe and get you the right support.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death from time to time. They\u2019re there, but I wouldn\u2019t say they take over my mind or anything like that. Even when those thoughts come up, I still manage to keep up with my basic routine and responsibilities. It\u2019s not easy, but I push through.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that. Can you tell me how often these thoughts about death come up and what usually brings them on? Have you had any specific plans or feelings that make you think about acting on those thoughts? Being honest here helps me keep you safe and get you the right help.\nPatient: Those thoughts come up a few times a week, mostly when I\u2019m feeling really overwhelmed or like I\u2019m stuck in a situation I can\u2019t get out of. But no, I don\u2019t have any plans or intentions to act on those thoughts. It\u2019s more like they\u2019re there as a sort of background thing, not something I\u2019m moving toward.\nDoctor: Got it. Now, let\u2019s shift focus\u2014have you noticed any changes in your interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy? It\u2019s important to understand how all these symptoms fit together.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed that some things I used to enjoy don\u2019t really grab my attention the same way anymore. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s completely gone, but there\u2019s definitely less pleasure or motivation to do those activities. It\u2019s enough to notice, but it doesn\u2019t take over everything.\nDoctor: You\u2019re noticing less motivation and enjoyment, even if it\u2019s not total loss\u2014thanks for sharing that. How about your mood overall\u2014do you feel sad or down most of the day, more often than not?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019d say I feel down pretty regularly. It\u2019s not something that completely takes over my day, but it\u2019s there most of the time. It definitely affects how I function, making things harder, but I\u2019m still able to get through my daily responsibilities.\nDoctor: You\u2019re feeling down most days and it\u2019s making functioning tougher. How about concentrating or making decisions\u2014have those been more difficult lately? How is that impacting your ability to get tasks done?\nPatient: Yeah, concentrating and making decisions have been a bit more difficult recently. It\u2019s noticeable enough that it slows me down sometimes when I\u2019m trying to finish tasks, but it doesn\u2019t stop me from getting things done. I just have to work a little harder to stay focused.\nDoctor: How often do you find yourself struggling with concentration and decision-making? Is it a constant issue, or does it come and go? And when it happens, how much does it affect the quality of your work or your overall functioning during the day?\nPatient: It comes and goes\u2014I don\u2019t struggle with concentration or decisions all the time, but when it happens, it definitely slows me down. It makes getting work and daily tasks done a bit harder, but I still manage to finish what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight\u2014like eating significantly more or less than usual, or any unexplained gains or losses?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes in my appetite or weight recently. Things have stayed pretty consistent on that front.\nDoctor: You mentioned trouble falling asleep and waking up a lot earlier. Besides that, are you having any other issues with your sleep, like nightmares or waking up feeling unrefreshed?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nYou mentioned trouble falling asleep and waking up a lot earlier.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. Lately, I\u2019ve just been feeling kind of down most days\u2014nothing too extreme, but consistently off. My sleep\u2019s been a problem; I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up more than I should. On top of that, I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m either really restless or, at times, moving slower than usual. It\u2019s been hard to settle into a regular rhythm.\nDoctor: You mentioned trouble falling asleep and waking up a lot\u2014how many nights a week would you say that happens? And when you\u2019re restless or moving slower, is that more of a physical sensation, like pacing or fidgeting, or something mental, like feeling agitated or slowed down in your thoughts? How much are these sleep and movement changes getting in the way of your day-to-day routine?\nPatient: I\u2019d say the sleep issues happen around four to five nights a week. It\u2019s mostly that I can\u2019t fall asleep right away and then I wake up a bunch during the night, which makes it hard to get good rest. As for the restlessness, it\u2019s mostly physical for me\u2014like pacing around or fiddling with things without really meaning to. The slowing down is different; sometimes my thoughts feel like they drag or move slower than usual, which can make even simple decisions take more effort. These things do interfere with my daily routine; I don\u2019t stop doing what I need to, but it definitely makes things tougher than they should be.\nDoctor: I appreciate the clear picture you\u2019re giving\u2014it sounds like those sleep disturbances and the mix of restlessness and slowed thinking really weigh on you. Given that, how often do you feel tired or drained during your day, even when you push through your routine?\nPatient: I do feel tired pretty regularly throughout the day, but it\u2019s usually manageable. It doesn\u2019t completely knock me out or anything, so I\u2019m still able to get through my daily tasks and responsibilities. It\u2019s more like a background drag that\u2019s there, but I keep pushing through it.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re carrying a steady load of fatigue but still managing to keep things moving. Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately, and if so, how would you describe their impact on you day to day?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling some worthlessness and guilt here and there. It\u2019s not overwhelming or constant, but it\u2019s definitely there enough to make some decisions harder and slow me down at times. It\u2019s like an extra weight, but one I\u2019ve gotten somewhat used to dealing with while still handling daily stuff.\nDoctor: You mentioned that these feelings come up now and then and weigh on you\u2014how often would you say they happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of making decisions or getting tasks done? It\u2019s common for these kinds of feelings to slow things down, even if they aren\u2019t constant or crippling.\nPatient: They come up a few times a week, not every day but often enough to notice. When they do show up, they definitely slow me down a bit\u2014making decisions take longer and making some tasks harder to finish smoothly. Still, I manage to keep up with my routine, even if it takes a bit more effort when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I need to ask directly\u2014have you had any recurring thoughts about death or suicide? It\u2019s important to know so we can make sure you\u2019re safe and get you the right support.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve had some recurring thoughts about death from time to time. They\u2019re there, but I wouldn\u2019t say they take over my mind or anything like that. Even when those thoughts come up, I still manage to keep up with my basic routine and responsibilities. It\u2019s not easy, but I push through.\nDoctor: Thanks for being open about that. Can you tell me how often these thoughts about death come up and what usually brings them on? Have you had any specific plans or feelings that make you think about acting on those thoughts? Being honest here helps me keep you safe and get you the right help.\nPatient: Those thoughts come up a few times a week, mostly when I\u2019m feeling really overwhelmed or like I\u2019m stuck in a situation I can\u2019t get out of. But no, I don\u2019t have any plans or intentions to act on those thoughts. It\u2019s more like they\u2019re there as a sort of background thing, not something I\u2019m moving toward.\nDoctor: Got it. Now, let\u2019s shift focus\u2014have you noticed any changes in your interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy? It\u2019s important to understand how all these symptoms fit together.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed that some things I used to enjoy don\u2019t really grab my attention the same way anymore. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s completely gone, but there\u2019s definitely less pleasure or motivation to do those activities. It\u2019s enough to notice, but it doesn\u2019t take over everything.\nDoctor: You\u2019re noticing less motivation and enjoyment, even if it\u2019s not total loss\u2014thanks for sharing that. How about your mood overall\u2014do you feel sad or down most of the day, more often than not?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019d say I feel down pretty regularly. It\u2019s not something that completely takes over my day, but it\u2019s there most of the time. It definitely affects how I function, making things harder, but I\u2019m still able to get through my daily responsibilities.\nDoctor: You\u2019re feeling down most days and it\u2019s making functioning tougher. How about concentrating or making decisions\u2014have those been more difficult lately? How is that impacting your ability to get tasks done?\nPatient: Yeah, concentrating and making decisions have been a bit more difficult recently. It\u2019s noticeable enough that it slows me down sometimes when I\u2019m trying to finish tasks, but it doesn\u2019t stop me from getting things done. I just have to work a little harder to stay focused.\nDoctor: How often do you find yourself struggling with concentration and decision-making? Is it a constant issue, or does it come and go? And when it happens, how much does it affect the quality of your work or your overall functioning during the day?\nPatient: It comes and goes\u2014I don\u2019t struggle with concentration or decisions all the time, but when it happens, it definitely slows me down. It makes getting work and daily tasks done a bit harder, but I still manage to finish what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight\u2014like eating significantly more or less than usual, or any unexplained gains or losses?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes in my appetite or weight recently. Things have stayed pretty consistent on that front.\nDoctor: You mentioned trouble falling asleep and waking up a lot earlier. Besides that, are you having any other issues with your sleep, like nightmares or waking up feeling unrefreshed?\nPatient: Sometimes I wake up feeling unrefreshed, even if I\u2019ve had some hours of sleep. But I haven\u2019t really noticed nightmares or anything like that\u2014just that the rest doesn\u2019t always feel fully restorative.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling restless or slowed down sometimes\u2014would you say you\u2019re physically more agitated or moving around more than usual, or more like feeling slowed physically? How much do these shifts interfere with your daily activities or work?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nYou mentioned feeling restless or slowed down sometimes\u2014would you say you\u2019re physically more agitated or moving around more than usual, or more like feeling slowed physically?

Now, let\u2019s shift focus\u2014have you noticed any changes in your interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy? It\u2019s important to understand how all these symptoms fit together.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed that some things I used to enjoy don\u2019t really grab my attention the same way anymore. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s completely gone, but there\u2019s definitely less pleasure or motivation to do those activities. It\u2019s enough to notice, but it doesn\u2019t take over everything.\nDoctor: You\u2019re noticing less motivation and enjoyment, even if it\u2019s not total loss\u2014thanks for sharing that. How about your mood overall\u2014do you feel sad or down most of the day, more often than not?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019d say I feel down pretty regularly. It\u2019s not something that completely takes over my day, but it\u2019s there most of the time. It definitely affects how I function, making things harder, but I\u2019m still able to get through my daily responsibilities.\nDoctor: You\u2019re feeling down most days and it\u2019s making functioning tougher. How about concentrating or making decisions\u2014have those been more difficult lately? How is that impacting your ability to get tasks done?\nPatient: Yeah, concentrating and making decisions have been a bit more difficult recently. It\u2019s noticeable enough that it slows me down sometimes when I\u2019m trying to finish tasks, but it doesn\u2019t stop me from getting things done. I just have to work a little harder to stay focused.\nDoctor: How often do you find yourself struggling with concentration and decision-making? Is it a constant issue, or does it come and go? And when it happens, how much does it affect the quality of your work or your overall functioning during the day?\nPatient: It comes and goes\u2014I don\u2019t struggle with concentration or decisions all the time, but when it happens, it definitely slows me down. It makes getting work and daily tasks done a bit harder, but I still manage to finish what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight\u2014like eating significantly more or less than usual, or any unexplained gains or losses?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes in my appetite or weight recently. Things have stayed pretty consistent on that front.\nDoctor: You mentioned trouble falling asleep and waking up a lot earlier. Besides that, are you having any other issues with your sleep, like nightmares or waking up feeling unrefreshed?\nPatient: Sometimes I wake up feeling unrefreshed, even if I\u2019ve had some hours of sleep. But I haven\u2019t really noticed nightmares or anything like that\u2014just that the rest doesn\u2019t always feel fully restorative.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling restless or slowed down sometimes\u2014would you say you\u2019re physically more agitated or moving around more than usual, or more like feeling slowed physically? How much do these shifts interfere with your daily activities or work?\nPatient: Mostly, the restlessness shows up as pacing or fidgeting\u2014moving around more than usual without really meaning to. As for the slowing, that happens sometimes too, where my physical movements feel slower. These shifts definitely make tasks harder and slow me down, but they don\u2019t completely stop me from getting things done. They interfere with daily activities to a noticeable but manageable extent.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
