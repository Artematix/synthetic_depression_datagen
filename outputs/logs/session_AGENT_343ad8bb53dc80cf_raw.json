Do not default to late 20s/early 30s. Create facets appropriate to the patient's life stage.\n- Make sure all information you create is compatible with the depression symptom profile. Higher symptom severity should show up as more impact on daily life, relationships, or goals. Lower severity should feel milder.\n- Keep trauma and serious adversity realistic and not universal.

When these thoughts come, how often would you say that happens? Are there certain times or situations when they tend to show up more? No rush\u2014share only what feels right for you.\nPatient: They happen now and then, not often.

How about your energy levels\u2014have you been feeling more tired than usual or lacking the energy you need to get through your day?\nPatient: Most days my energy is fine. Sometimes I feel a bit tired, but it\u2019s nothing serious.\nDoctor: Got it. How have your sleep patterns been lately? Do you have any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: I usually fall asleep okay, but I have some trouble staying asleep through the night.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood.

When these thoughts come, how often would you say that happens? Are there certain times or situations when they tend to show up more? No rush\u2014share only what feels right for you.\nPatient: They happen now and then, not often. I don\u2019t really notice any specific time or reason for them.\nDoctor: Thank you for explaining that, Marie.

Sometimes I feel a bit tired, but it\u2019s nothing serious.\nDoctor: Got it. How have your sleep patterns been lately? Do you have any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: I usually fall asleep okay, but I have some trouble staying asleep through the night. Still, I get enough rest to get through the day.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. When you wake up during the night, how often does that happen? And how long are you usually awake before falling back asleep? Does this impact how you feel during the day at all?

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

How have you been feeling emotionally these days? Have you found yourself feeling sad or low more often than not?\nPatient: Not really. Feeling low doesn\u2019t happen much these days.\nDoctor: I hear you \u2014 it sounds like feeling sad isn\u2019t a big part of your days at the moment. Have you noticed any other shifts in how you\u2019re feeling emotionally, like more irritability, anxiety, or anything else that feels different?\nPatient: Sometimes I do get a bit irritable. Concentrating can be harder now and then. Nothing major though.\nDoctor: That irritability and trouble concentrating you mention\u2014how often do you find those coming up? Do they make it tougher to get through your usual day? Take your time.\nPatient: They come up fairly often. I manage to get by, so it doesn\u2019t really stop me from doing what I need.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re holding things together well, which is good to hear. When those moments of irritability or trouble concentrating come up, do they ever feel overwhelming or just tougher to handle than usual? And how long have you been noticing these changes? I\u2019m here to understand what you\u2019re going through.\nPatient: No, they\u2019re not overwhelming. Just a bit tougher sometimes. These changes have been going on for quite a while now.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Marie. I want to ask something important \u2014 have you found yourself thinking about death or wishing you wouldn\u2019t be here anymore? It\u2019s okay to be honest; this helps me understand how to support you best.\nPatient: Sometimes the thought crosses my mind, but it\u2019s not constant or something I dwell on.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, and I\u2019m glad you felt comfortable telling me. When these thoughts come, how often would you say that happens? Are there certain times or situations when they tend to show up more? No rush\u2014share only what feels right for you.\nPatient: They happen now and then, not often. I don\u2019t really notice any specific time or reason for them.\nDoctor: Thank you for explaining that, Marie. How about your energy levels\u2014have you been feeling more tired than usual or lacking the energy you need to get through your day?\nPatient: Most days my energy is fine. Sometimes I feel a bit tired, but it\u2019s nothing serious.\nDoctor: Got it. How have your sleep patterns been lately? Do you have any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: I usually fall asleep okay, but I have some trouble staying asleep through the night. Still, I get enough rest to get through the day.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. When you wake up during the night, how often does that happen? And how long are you usually awake before falling back asleep? Does this impact how you feel during the day at all? I want to get a clear picture so I can support you well.\nPatient: I wake up a few times most nights. Usually, I fall back asleep pretty quickly. It doesn\u2019t really affect me much during the day.\nDoctor: That helps me understand better, thank you. Now, about concentrating or making decisions \u2014 have you noticed these getting harder lately? How do these difficulties show up in your day-to-day life?\nPatient: I do have trouble concentrating fairly often. It can make decisions a bit harder, but I manage to get through.\nDoctor: I hear you manage despite the challenges, which is commendable.

Feeling low doesn\u2019t happen much these days.\nDoctor: I hear you \u2014 it sounds like feeling sad isn\u2019t a big part of your days at the moment. Have you noticed any other shifts in how you\u2019re feeling emotionally, like more irritability, anxiety, or anything else that feels different?\nPatient: Sometimes I do get a bit irritable.

When those moments of irritability or trouble concentrating come up, do they ever feel overwhelming or just tougher to handle than usual? And how long have you been noticing these changes? I\u2019m here to understand what you\u2019re going through.\nPatient: No, they\u2019re not overwhelming. Just a bit tougher sometimes. These changes have been going on for quite a while now.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Marie.

No rush\u2014share only what feels right for you.\nPatient: They happen now and then, not often. I don\u2019t really notice any specific time or reason for them.\nDoctor: Thank you for explaining that, Marie. How about your energy levels\u2014have you been feeling more tired than usual or lacking the energy you need to get through your day?\nPatient: Most days my energy is fine. Sometimes I feel a bit tired, but it\u2019s nothing serious.\nDoctor: Got it. How have your sleep patterns been lately? Do you have any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: I usually fall asleep okay, but I have some trouble staying asleep through the night. Still, I get enough rest to get through the day.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. When you wake up during the night, how often does that happen? And how long are you usually awake before falling back asleep? Does this impact how you feel during the day at all? I want to get a clear picture so I can support you well.\nPatient: I wake up a few times most nights. Usually, I fall back asleep pretty quickly.

Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

How have you been feeling emotionally these days? Have you found yourself feeling sad or low more often than not?\nPatient: Not really. Feeling low doesn\u2019t happen much these days.\nDoctor: I hear you \u2014 it sounds like feeling sad isn\u2019t a big part of your days at the moment. Have you noticed any other shifts in how you\u2019re feeling emotionally, like more irritability, anxiety, or anything else that feels different?\nPatient: Sometimes I do get a bit irritable. Concentrating can be harder now and then. Nothing major though.\nDoctor: That irritability and trouble concentrating you mention\u2014how often do you find those coming up? Do they make it tougher to get through your usual day? Take your time.\nPatient: They come up fairly often. I manage to get by, so it doesn\u2019t really stop me from doing what I need.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re holding things together well, which is good to hear. When those moments of irritability or trouble concentrating come up, do they ever feel overwhelming or just tougher to handle than usual? And how long have you been noticing these changes? I\u2019m here to understand what you\u2019re going through.\nPatient: No, they\u2019re not overwhelming. Just a bit tougher sometimes. These changes have been going on for quite a while now.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Marie. I want to ask something important \u2014 have you found yourself thinking about death or wishing you wouldn\u2019t be here anymore? It\u2019s okay to be honest; this helps me understand how to support you best.\nPatient: Sometimes the thought crosses my mind, but it\u2019s not constant or something I dwell on.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, and I\u2019m glad you felt comfortable telling me. When these thoughts come, how often would you say that happens? Are there certain times or situations when they tend to show up more? No rush\u2014share only what feels right for you.\nPatient: They happen now and then, not often. I don\u2019t really notice any specific time or reason for them.\nDoctor: Thank you for explaining that, Marie. How about your energy levels\u2014have you been feeling more tired than usual or lacking the energy you need to get through your day?\nPatient: Most days my energy is fine. Sometimes I feel a bit tired, but it\u2019s nothing serious.\nDoctor: Got it. How have your sleep patterns been lately? Do you have any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: I usually fall asleep okay, but I have some trouble staying asleep through the night. Still, I get enough rest to get through the day.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. When you wake up during the night, how often does that happen? And how long are you usually awake before falling back asleep? Does this impact how you feel during the day at all? I want to get a clear picture so I can support you well.\nPatient: I wake up a few times most nights. Usually, I fall back asleep pretty quickly. It doesn\u2019t really affect me much during the day.\nDoctor: That helps me understand better, thank you. Now, about concentrating or making decisions \u2014 have you noticed these getting harder lately? How do these difficulties show up in your day-to-day life?\nPatient: I do have trouble concentrating fairly often. It can make decisions a bit harder, but I manage to get through.\nDoctor: I hear you manage despite the challenges, which is commendable. Can you tell me about a time recently when concentrating or making a decision felt especially tough for you? It helps me understand what you're facing day to day.\nPatient: Earlier this week, I had trouble focusing on a bill that needed paying. Took me a bit longer, but I got it done.\nDoctor: That sounds like it took some real effort, but you pushed through and handled it\u2014that shows a lot of determination. It\u2019s impressive how you keep things moving even when your focus isn\u2019t where you want it to be.\nPatient: Yes, it does take some effort, but I manage to keep things under control.\nDoctor: You\u2019re doing a great job with all that, Marie.

How have you been feeling emotionally these days? Have you found yourself feeling sad or low more often than not?\nPatient: Not really. Feeling low doesn\u2019t happen much these days.\nDoctor: I hear you \u2014 it sounds like feeling sad isn\u2019t a big part of your days at the moment. Have you noticed any other shifts in how you\u2019re feeling emotionally, like more irritability, anxiety, or anything else that feels different?\nPatient: Sometimes I do get a bit irritable. Concentrating can be harder now and then. Nothing major though.\nDoctor: That irritability and trouble concentrating you mention\u2014how often do you find those coming up? Do they make it tougher to get through your usual day? Take your time.\nPatient: They come up fairly often. I manage to get by, so it doesn\u2019t really stop me from doing what I need.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019re holding things together well, which is good to hear. When those moments of irritability or trouble concentrating come up, do they ever feel overwhelming or just tougher to handle than usual? And how long have you been noticing these changes? I\u2019m here to understand what you\u2019re going through.\nPatient: No, they\u2019re not overwhelming. Just a bit tougher sometimes. These changes have been going on for quite a while now.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Marie. I want to ask something important \u2014 have you found yourself thinking about death or wishing you wouldn\u2019t be here anymore? It\u2019s okay to be honest; this helps me understand how to support you best.\nPatient: Sometimes the thought crosses my mind, but it\u2019s not constant or something I dwell on.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough, and I\u2019m glad you felt comfortable telling me. When these thoughts come, how often would you say that happens? Are there certain times or situations when they tend to show up more? No rush\u2014share only what feels right for you.\nPatient: They happen now and then, not often. I don\u2019t really notice any specific time or reason for them.\nDoctor: Thank you for explaining that, Marie. How about your energy levels\u2014have you been feeling more tired than usual or lacking the energy you need to get through your day?\nPatient: Most days my energy is fine. Sometimes I feel a bit tired, but it\u2019s nothing serious.\nDoctor: Got it. How have your sleep patterns been lately? Do you have any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: I usually fall asleep okay, but I have some trouble staying asleep through the night. Still, I get enough rest to get through the day.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. When you wake up during the night, how often does that happen? And how long are you usually awake before falling back asleep? Does this impact how you feel during the day at all? I want to get a clear picture so I can support you well.\nPatient: I wake up a few times most nights. Usually, I fall back asleep pretty quickly. It doesn\u2019t really affect me much during the day.\nDoctor: That helps me understand better, thank you. Now, about concentrating or making decisions \u2014 have you noticed these getting harder lately? How do these difficulties show up in your day-to-day life?\nPatient: I do have trouble concentrating fairly often. It can make decisions a bit harder, but I manage to get through.\nDoctor: I hear you manage despite the challenges, which is commendable. Can you tell me about a time recently when concentrating or making a decision felt especially tough for you? It helps me understand what you're facing day to day.\nPatient: Earlier this week, I had trouble focusing on a bill that needed paying. Took me a bit longer, but I got it done.\nDoctor: That sounds like it took some real effort, but you pushed through and handled it\u2014that shows a lot of determination. It\u2019s impressive how you keep things moving even when your focus isn\u2019t where you want it to be.\nPatient: Yes, it does take some effort, but I manage to keep things under control.\nDoctor: You\u2019re doing a great job with all that, Marie. Managing daily life with these challenges takes real strength, and your perseverance shines through. It\u2019s important to recognize just how capable you are.\nPatient: Thank you. I do the best I can.\nDoctor: And doing your best is what really counts\u2014especially with everything you\u2019ve been through. If there\u2019s anything else on your mind, anything you want to share, I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready.\nPatient: I appreciate that.

No rush\u2014share only what feels right for you.\nPatient: They happen now and then, not often. I don\u2019t really notice any specific time or reason for them.\nDoctor: Thank you for explaining that, Marie. How about your energy levels\u2014have you been feeling more tired than usual or lacking the energy you need to get through your day?\nPatient: Most days my energy is fine. Sometimes I feel a bit tired, but it\u2019s nothing serious.\nDoctor: Got it. How have your sleep patterns been lately? Do you have any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: I usually fall asleep okay, but I have some trouble staying asleep through the night. Still, I get enough rest to get through the day.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. When you wake up during the night, how often does that happen? And how long are you usually awake before falling back asleep? Does this impact how you feel during the day at all? I want to get a clear picture so I can support you well.\nPatient: I wake up a few times most nights. Usually, I fall back asleep pretty quickly. It doesn\u2019t really affect me much during the day.\nDoctor: That helps me understand better, thank you. Now, about concentrating or making decisions \u2014 have you noticed these getting harder lately? How do these difficulties show up in your day-to-day life?\nPatient: I do have trouble concentrating fairly often. It can make decisions a bit harder, but I manage to get through.\nDoctor: I hear you manage despite the challenges, which is commendable. Can you tell me about a time recently when concentrating or making a decision felt especially tough for you? It helps me understand what you're facing day to day.\nPatient: Earlier this week, I had trouble focusing on a bill that needed paying. Took me a bit longer, but I got it done.\nDoctor: That sounds like it took some real effort, but you pushed through and handled it\u2014that shows a lot of determination. It\u2019s impressive how you keep things moving even when your focus isn\u2019t where you want it to be.\nPatient: Yes, it does take some effort, but I manage to keep things under control.\nDoctor: You\u2019re doing a great job with all that, Marie. Managing daily life with these challenges takes real strength, and your perseverance shines through. It\u2019s important to recognize just how capable you are.\nPatient: Thank you. I do the best I can.\nDoctor: And doing your best is what really counts\u2014especially with everything you\u2019ve been through. If there\u2019s anything else on your mind, anything you want to share, I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Nothing else at the moment.\nDoctor: Understood. How about things you\u2019ve normally enjoyed\u2014have you noticed any loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies or activities you used to like?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really noticed any change with that.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nNo, I haven\u2019t really noticed any change with that.",

Sometimes I feel a bit tired, but it\u2019s nothing serious.\nDoctor: Got it. How have your sleep patterns been lately? Do you have any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: I usually fall asleep okay, but I have some trouble staying asleep through the night.

And how long are you usually awake before falling back asleep? Does this impact how you feel during the day at all?

No rush\u2014share only what feels right for you.\nPatient: They happen now and then, not often.

How about your energy levels\u2014have you been feeling more tired than usual or lacking the energy you need to get through your day?\nPatient: Most days my energy is fine. Sometimes I feel a bit tired, but it\u2019s nothing serious.\nDoctor: Got it. How have your sleep patterns been lately? Do you have any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: I usually fall asleep okay, but I have some trouble staying asleep through the night. Still, I get enough rest to get through the day.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. When you wake up during the night, how often does that happen? And how long are you usually awake before falling back asleep? Does this impact how you feel during the day at all? I want to get a clear picture so I can support you well.\nPatient: I wake up a few times most nights. Usually, I fall back asleep pretty quickly.

No rush\u2014share only what feels right for you.\nPatient: They happen now and then, not often.

Sometimes I feel a bit tired, but it\u2019s nothing serious.\nDoctor: Got it. How have your sleep patterns been lately? Do you have any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: I usually fall asleep okay, but I have some trouble staying asleep through the night.

How do these difficulties show up in your day-to-day life?\nPatient: I do have trouble concentrating fairly often. It can make decisions a bit harder, but I manage to get through.\nDoctor: I hear you manage despite the challenges, which is commendable. Can you tell me about a time recently when concentrating or making a decision felt especially tough for you? It helps me understand what you're facing day to day.\nPatient: Earlier this week, I had trouble focusing on a bill that needed paying. Took me a bit longer, but I got it done.\nDoctor: That sounds like it took some real effort, but you pushed through and handled it\u2014that shows a lot of determination. It\u2019s impressive how you keep things moving even when your focus isn\u2019t where you want it to be.\nPatient: Yes, it does take some effort, but I manage to keep things under control.\nDoctor: You\u2019re doing a great job with all that, Marie. Managing daily life with these challenges takes real strength, and your perseverance shines through. It\u2019s important to recognize just how capable you are.\nPatient: Thank you. I do the best I can.\nDoctor: And doing your best is what really counts\u2014especially with everything you\u2019ve been through. If there\u2019s anything else on your mind, anything you want to share, I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Nothing else at the moment.\nDoctor: Understood. How about things you\u2019ve normally enjoyed\u2014have you noticed any loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies or activities you used to like?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really noticed any change with that.\nDoctor: Thanks for telling me. Have you had any feelings of worthlessness or guilt lately\u2014maybe feeling like you\u2019re to blame for things or that you don\u2019t measure up?\nPatient: Sometimes, yes.

If you\u2019ve noticed anything that seems to bring them on or ways you handle them, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: They come up now and then, but they\u2019re not very strong. I don\u2019t really know what causes them. I just keep going.\nDoctor: It takes a lot of strength to keep going through those moments, even when they\u2019re not strong. Do you notice if they change your mood or how you act when they come up? Are there things you do to help get through those times?\nPatient: They don\u2019t really change my mood or behavior much. I just keep doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Your resilience really shows in how you keep moving forward. Do you have certain ways of thinking or things you do that help you keep going when those feelings pop up?

No rush\u2014share only what feels right for you.\nPatient: They happen now and then, not often.

Sometimes I feel a bit tired, but it\u2019s nothing serious.\nDoctor: Got it. How have your sleep patterns been lately? Do you have any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: I usually fall asleep okay, but I have some trouble staying asleep through the night. Still, I get enough rest to get through the day.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. When you wake up during the night, how often does that happen? And how long are you usually awake before falling back asleep? Does this impact how you feel during the day at all?

Still, I get enough rest to get through the day.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. When you wake up during the night, how often does that happen? And how long are you usually awake before falling back asleep? Does this impact how you feel during the day at all? I want to get a clear picture so I can support you well.\nPatient: I wake up a few times most nights. Usually, I fall back asleep pretty quickly. It doesn\u2019t really affect me much during the day.\nDoctor: That helps me understand better, thank you. Now, about concentrating or making decisions \u2014 have you noticed these getting harder lately? How do these difficulties show up in your day-to-day life?\nPatient: I do have trouble concentrating fairly often. It can make decisions a bit harder, but I manage to get through.\nDoctor: I hear you manage despite the challenges, which is commendable. Can you tell me about a time recently when concentrating or making a decision felt especially tough for you? It helps me understand what you're facing day to day.\nPatient: Earlier this week, I had trouble focusing on a bill that needed paying. Took me a bit longer, but I got it done.\nDoctor: That sounds like it took some real effort, but you pushed through and handled it\u2014that shows a lot of determination. It\u2019s impressive how you keep things moving even when your focus isn\u2019t where you want it to be.\nPatient: Yes, it does take some effort, but I manage to keep things under control.\nDoctor: You\u2019re doing a great job with all that, Marie. Managing daily life with these challenges takes real strength, and your perseverance shines through. It\u2019s important to recognize just how capable you are.\nPatient: Thank you. I do the best I can.\nDoctor: And doing your best is what really counts\u2014especially with everything you\u2019ve been through. If there\u2019s anything else on your mind, anything you want to share, I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Nothing else at the moment.\nDoctor: Understood. How about things you\u2019ve normally enjoyed\u2014have you noticed any loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies or activities you used to like?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really noticed any change with that.\nDoctor: Thanks for telling me. Have you had any feelings of worthlessness or guilt lately\u2014maybe feeling like you\u2019re to blame for things or that you don\u2019t measure up?\nPatient: Sometimes, yes. It happens now and then.\nDoctor: That\u2019s important to share, Marie. When those feelings come up, how often would you say that is? And how strong do they feel when they happen? If you\u2019ve noticed anything that seems to bring them on or ways you handle them, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: They come up now and then, but they\u2019re not very strong. I don\u2019t really know what causes them. I just keep going.\nDoctor: It takes a lot of strength to keep going through those moments, even when they\u2019re not strong. Do you notice if they change your mood or how you act when they come up? Are there things you do to help get through those times?\nPatient: They don\u2019t really change my mood or behavior much. I just keep doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Your resilience really shows in how you keep moving forward. Do you have certain ways of thinking or things you do that help you keep going when those feelings pop up? And sometimes, even with strong determination, moments can get harder\u2014do you ever feel overwhelmed despite your steady approach?\nPatient: I focus on what needs doing. I rarely feel overwhelmed.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Marie.

When these thoughts come, how often would you say that happens? Are there certain times or situations when they tend to show up more? No rush\u2014share only what feels right for you.\nPatient: They happen now and then, not often. I don\u2019t really notice any specific time or reason for them.\nDoctor: Thank you for explaining that, Marie. How about your energy levels\u2014have you been feeling more tired than usual or lacking the energy you need to get through your day?\nPatient: Most days my energy is fine. Sometimes I feel a bit tired, but it\u2019s nothing serious.\nDoctor: Got it. How have your sleep patterns been lately? Do you have any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling rested?\nPatient: I usually fall asleep okay, but I have some trouble staying asleep through the night. Still, I get enough rest to get through the day.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. When you wake up during the night, how often does that happen? And how long are you usually awake before falling back asleep? Does this impact how you feel during the day at all? I want to get a clear picture so I can support you well.\nPatient: I wake up a few times most nights. Usually, I fall back asleep pretty quickly. It doesn\u2019t really affect me much during the day.\nDoctor: That helps me understand better, thank you. Now, about concentrating or making decisions \u2014 have you noticed these getting harder lately? How do these difficulties show up in your day-to-day life?\nPatient: I do have trouble concentrating fairly often. It can make decisions a bit harder, but I manage to get through.\nDoctor: I hear you manage despite the challenges, which is commendable. Can you tell me about a time recently when concentrating or making a decision felt especially tough for you? It helps me understand what you're facing day to day.\nPatient: Earlier this week, I had trouble focusing on a bill that needed paying. Took me a bit longer, but I got it done.\nDoctor: That sounds like it took some real effort, but you pushed through and handled it\u2014that shows a lot of determination. It\u2019s impressive how you keep things moving even when your focus isn\u2019t where you want it to be.\nPatient: Yes, it does take some effort, but I manage to keep things under control.\nDoctor: You\u2019re doing a great job with all that, Marie. Managing daily life with these challenges takes real strength, and your perseverance shines through. It\u2019s important to recognize just how capable you are.\nPatient: Thank you. I do the best I can.\nDoctor: And doing your best is what really counts\u2014especially with everything you\u2019ve been through. If there\u2019s anything else on your mind, anything you want to share, I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Nothing else at the moment.\nDoctor: Understood. How about things you\u2019ve normally enjoyed\u2014have you noticed any loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies or activities you used to like?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really noticed any change with that.\nDoctor: Thanks for telling me. Have you had any feelings of worthlessness or guilt lately\u2014maybe feeling like you\u2019re to blame for things or that you don\u2019t measure up?\nPatient: Sometimes, yes. It happens now and then.\nDoctor: That\u2019s important to share, Marie. When those feelings come up, how often would you say that is? And how strong do they feel when they happen? If you\u2019ve noticed anything that seems to bring them on or ways you handle them, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: They come up now and then, but they\u2019re not very strong. I don\u2019t really know what causes them. I just keep going.\nDoctor: It takes a lot of strength to keep going through those moments, even when they\u2019re not strong. Do you notice if they change your mood or how you act when they come up? Are there things you do to help get through those times?\nPatient: They don\u2019t really change my mood or behavior much. I just keep doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: Your resilience really shows in how you keep moving forward. Do you have certain ways of thinking or things you do that help you keep going when those feelings pop up? And sometimes, even with strong determination, moments can get harder\u2014do you ever feel overwhelmed despite your steady approach?\nPatient: I focus on what needs doing. I rarely feel overwhelmed.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Marie. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently\u2014either eating more, less, or staying about the same?\nPatient: No, my appetite and weight have stayed about the same.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good to hear. How about your physical energy or movements\u2014have you felt more restless or, on the other hand, slower or more sluggish than usual? Take your time telling me what you\u2019ve noticed.\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit restless, other times a bit slower. It doesn\u2019t really affect my routine.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
