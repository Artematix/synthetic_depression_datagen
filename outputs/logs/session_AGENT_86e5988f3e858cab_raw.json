Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories.

How often would you say they come up? Anything usually set them off?

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

My energy has been kind of low, and that's been a bit frustrating.\nDoctor: Okay, when you say trouble sleeping, do you mean you can\u2019t fall asleep, you wake up during the night, or you\u2019re up way too early? And how often is this happening? Also, this low energy\u2014how much is it messing with your day-to-day stuff or work?\nPatient: I tend to wake up during the night, though it\u2019s not every night. It\u2019s enough to be noticeable but not consistent. As for the low energy, it does affect my concentration at work sometimes, making it harder to focus, but I manage to keep up with things without major problems.\nDoctor: You said concentration is a bit off sometimes\u2014how often do you find it hard to focus or make decisions? And is it affecting your work or daily life beyond just being annoying?\nPatient: It happens occasionally, not too often. When it does, it\u2019s a bit bothersome, but I\u2019m still able to get my work done and manage things day to day without much trouble.\nDoctor: So it\u2019s happening now and then, nothing constant\u2014that makes sense. But when you say \u2018occasionally,\u2019 are we talking once a week, a few times a month? And have you noticed if it\u2019s worse in certain situations or times of day?\nPatient: It\u2019s about once a week, more or less. I haven\u2019t noticed any specific pattern or particular triggers that seem to make it worse.\nDoctor: Okay, so concentration slips about once a week without a clear cause. With that and feeling low energy, I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling down on yourself or carrying guilt more than usual lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have some occasional feelings like that, but they aren\u2019t overwhelming or really getting in the way of things most of the time.\nDoctor: Got it, so these feelings pop up now and then but don\u2019t overwhelm you. How often would you say they come up? Anything usually set them off? And do you notice any physical signs when that happens or ways you try to handle it?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, usually without any clear reason. Physically, it\u2019s subtle\u2014just a little tension or tiredness sometimes. I try to manage it quietly on my own, so it doesn\u2019t become a problem for others.\nDoctor: Alright, once a week, subtle physical stuff, and you keep it to yourself. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014like eating more or less than usual, or any recent weight shifts?\nPatient: Nothing significant, maybe just a minor change now and then, but nothing really noticeable.\nDoctor: Okay, so appetite and weight are mostly stable. Have you been feeling sad, empty, or hopeless lately?\nPatient: Occasionally, I do feel a bit sad or empty, but it\u2019s not frequent or overwhelming. I manage to keep things under control most of the time.\nDoctor: You say those sad or empty feelings come up sometimes\u2014how often exactly? And when they hit, would you say they\u2019re mild, moderate, or pretty intense? Do they ever make it hard to get through your day, or are you able to keep going okay?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, and I\u2019d say they\u2019re usually mild.

My energy has been kind of low, and that's been a bit frustrating.\nDoctor: Okay, when you say trouble sleeping, do you mean you can\u2019t fall asleep, you wake up during the night, or you\u2019re up way too early? And how often is this happening? Also, this low energy\u2014how much is it messing with your day-to-day stuff or work?\nPatient: I tend to wake up during the night, though it\u2019s not every night. It\u2019s enough to be noticeable but not consistent. As for the low energy, it does affect my concentration at work sometimes, making it harder to focus, but I manage to keep up with things without major problems.\nDoctor: You said concentration is a bit off sometimes\u2014how often do you find it hard to focus or make decisions? And is it affecting your work or daily life beyond just being annoying?\nPatient: It happens occasionally, not too often. When it does, it\u2019s a bit bothersome, but I\u2019m still able to get my work done and manage things day to day without much trouble.\nDoctor: So it\u2019s happening now and then, nothing constant\u2014that makes sense. But when you say \u2018occasionally,\u2019 are we talking once a week, a few times a month?

How often would you say they come up? Anything usually set them off? And do you notice any physical signs when that happens or ways you try to handle it?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, usually without any clear reason. Physically, it\u2019s subtle\u2014just a little tension or tiredness sometimes. I try to manage it quietly on my own, so it doesn\u2019t become a problem for others.\nDoctor: Alright, once a week, subtle physical stuff, and you keep it to yourself. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014like eating more or less than usual, or any recent weight shifts?\nPatient: Nothing significant, maybe just a minor change now and then, but nothing really noticeable.\nDoctor: Okay, so appetite and weight are mostly stable. Have you been feeling sad, empty, or hopeless lately?\nPatient: Occasionally, I do feel a bit sad or empty, but it\u2019s not frequent or overwhelming. I manage to keep things under control most of the time.\nDoctor: You say those sad or empty feelings come up sometimes\u2014how often exactly? And when they hit, would you say they\u2019re mild, moderate, or pretty intense? Do they ever make it hard to get through your day, or are you able to keep going okay?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, and I\u2019d say they\u2019re usually mild. They\u2019re unpleasant, but I can still get through my day and manage my responsibilities without much trouble.\nDoctor: Once a week and mostly mild, got it.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

My energy has been kind of low, and that's been a bit frustrating.\nDoctor: Okay, when you say trouble sleeping, do you mean you can\u2019t fall asleep, you wake up during the night, or you\u2019re up way too early? And how often is this happening? Also, this low energy\u2014how much is it messing with your day-to-day stuff or work?\nPatient: I tend to wake up during the night, though it\u2019s not every night. It\u2019s enough to be noticeable but not consistent. As for the low energy, it does affect my concentration at work sometimes, making it harder to focus, but I manage to keep up with things without major problems.\nDoctor: You said concentration is a bit off sometimes\u2014how often do you find it hard to focus or make decisions? And is it affecting your work or daily life beyond just being annoying?\nPatient: It happens occasionally, not too often. When it does, it\u2019s a bit bothersome, but I\u2019m still able to get my work done and manage things day to day without much trouble.\nDoctor: So it\u2019s happening now and then, nothing constant\u2014that makes sense. But when you say \u2018occasionally,\u2019 are we talking once a week, a few times a month? And have you noticed if it\u2019s worse in certain situations or times of day?\nPatient: It\u2019s about once a week, more or less. I haven\u2019t noticed any specific pattern or particular triggers that seem to make it worse.\nDoctor: Okay, so concentration slips about once a week without a clear cause. With that and feeling low energy, I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling down on yourself or carrying guilt more than usual lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have some occasional feelings like that, but they aren\u2019t overwhelming or really getting in the way of things most of the time.\nDoctor: Got it, so these feelings pop up now and then but don\u2019t overwhelm you. How often would you say they come up? Anything usually set them off? And do you notice any physical signs when that happens or ways you try to handle it?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, usually without any clear reason. Physically, it\u2019s subtle\u2014just a little tension or tiredness sometimes. I try to manage it quietly on my own, so it doesn\u2019t become a problem for others.\nDoctor: Alright, once a week, subtle physical stuff, and you keep it to yourself. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014like eating more or less than usual, or any recent weight shifts?\nPatient: Nothing significant, maybe just a minor change now and then, but nothing really noticeable.\nDoctor: Okay, so appetite and weight are mostly stable. Have you been feeling sad, empty, or hopeless lately?\nPatient: Occasionally, I do feel a bit sad or empty, but it\u2019s not frequent or overwhelming. I manage to keep things under control most of the time.\nDoctor: You say those sad or empty feelings come up sometimes\u2014how often exactly? And when they hit, would you say they\u2019re mild, moderate, or pretty intense? Do they ever make it hard to get through your day, or are you able to keep going okay?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, and I\u2019d say they\u2019re usually mild. They\u2019re unpleasant, but I can still get through my day and manage my responsibilities without much trouble.\nDoctor: Once a week and mostly mild, got it. Are there any particular times, places, or events that tend to bring on those feelings? Do they come on suddenly, or do you notice anything that signals they\u2019re about to start?\nPatient: Not really\u2014there\u2019s no clear pattern or specific event that I can point to. The feelings usually come on gradually rather than all at once. I try to handle them quietly so they don\u2019t become a burden to others.\nDoctor: Alright, no clear triggers and it builds up slowly.

Can be a comment or observation, not only a question.\n\nDSM:\n- Preferred when DSM symptom keys remain and the current topic is reasonably understood.\n- Suggest a natural transition from the current conversation.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I've just been feeling a bit off\u2014mostly tired and having some trouble sleeping. It's nothing too severe, but it\u2019s been enough to notice. My energy has been kind of low, and that's been a bit frustrating.\nDoctor: Okay, when you say trouble sleeping, do you mean you can\u2019t fall asleep, you wake up during the night, or you\u2019re up way too early? And how often is this happening? Also, this low energy\u2014how much is it messing with your day-to-day stuff or work?\nPatient: I tend to wake up during the night, though it\u2019s not every night. It\u2019s enough to be noticeable but not consistent. As for the low energy, it does affect my concentration at work sometimes, making it harder to focus, but I manage to keep up with things without major problems.\nDoctor: You said concentration is a bit off sometimes\u2014how often do you find it hard to focus or make decisions? And is it affecting your work or daily life beyond just being annoying?\nPatient: It happens occasionally, not too often. When it does, it\u2019s a bit bothersome, but I\u2019m still able to get my work done and manage things day to day without much trouble.\nDoctor: So it\u2019s happening now and then, nothing constant\u2014that makes sense. But when you say \u2018occasionally,\u2019 are we talking once a week, a few times a month? And have you noticed if it\u2019s worse in certain situations or times of day?\nPatient: It\u2019s about once a week, more or less. I haven\u2019t noticed any specific pattern or particular triggers that seem to make it worse.\nDoctor: Okay, so concentration slips about once a week without a clear cause. With that and feeling low energy, I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling down on yourself or carrying guilt more than usual lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have some occasional feelings like that, but they aren\u2019t overwhelming or really getting in the way of things most of the time.\nDoctor: Got it, so these feelings pop up now and then but don\u2019t overwhelm you. How often would you say they come up? Anything usually set them off? And do you notice any physical signs when that happens or ways you try to handle it?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, usually without any clear reason. Physically, it\u2019s subtle\u2014just a little tension or tiredness sometimes. I try to manage it quietly on my own, so it doesn\u2019t become a problem for others.\nDoctor: Alright, once a week, subtle physical stuff, and you keep it to yourself. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014like eating more or less than usual, or any recent weight shifts?\nPatient: Nothing significant, maybe just a minor change now and then, but nothing really noticeable.\nDoctor: Okay, so appetite and weight are mostly stable. Have you been feeling sad, empty, or hopeless lately?\nPatient: Occasionally, I do feel a bit sad or empty, but it\u2019s not frequent or overwhelming. I manage to keep things under control most of the time.\nDoctor: You say those sad or empty feelings come up sometimes\u2014how often exactly? And when they hit, would you say they\u2019re mild, moderate, or pretty intense? Do they ever make it hard to get through your day, or are you able to keep going okay?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, and I\u2019d say they\u2019re usually mild. They\u2019re unpleasant, but I can still get through my day and manage my responsibilities without much trouble.\nDoctor: Once a week and mostly mild, got it. Are there any particular times, places, or events that tend to bring on those feelings? Do they come on suddenly, or do you notice anything that signals they\u2019re about to start?\nPatient: Not really\u2014there\u2019s no clear pattern or specific event that I can point to. The feelings usually come on gradually rather than all at once. I try to handle them quietly so they don\u2019t become a burden to others.\nDoctor: Alright, no clear triggers and it builds up slowly. I need to ask\u2014have you had any thoughts about death, hurting yourself, or suicide lately?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straight with me about that\u2014that\u2019s important. Since you\u2019re managing to keep things moving, how do you usually cope when these low feelings or fatigue come up during the day?\nPatient: I try to manage things quietly on my own\u2014usually by taking a moment to pause or focus on practical tasks.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I've just been feeling a bit off\u2014mostly tired and having some trouble sleeping. It's nothing too severe, but it\u2019s been enough to notice. My energy has been kind of low, and that's been a bit frustrating.\nDoctor: Okay, when you say trouble sleeping, do you mean you can\u2019t fall asleep, you wake up during the night, or you\u2019re up way too early? And how often is this happening? Also, this low energy\u2014how much is it messing with your day-to-day stuff or work?\nPatient: I tend to wake up during the night, though it\u2019s not every night. It\u2019s enough to be noticeable but not consistent. As for the low energy, it does affect my concentration at work sometimes, making it harder to focus, but I manage to keep up with things without major problems.\nDoctor: You said concentration is a bit off sometimes\u2014how often do you find it hard to focus or make decisions? And is it affecting your work or daily life beyond just being annoying?\nPatient: It happens occasionally, not too often. When it does, it\u2019s a bit bothersome, but I\u2019m still able to get my work done and manage things day to day without much trouble.\nDoctor: So it\u2019s happening now and then, nothing constant\u2014that makes sense. But when you say \u2018occasionally,\u2019 are we talking once a week, a few times a month? And have you noticed if it\u2019s worse in certain situations or times of day?\nPatient: It\u2019s about once a week, more or less. I haven\u2019t noticed any specific pattern or particular triggers that seem to make it worse.\nDoctor: Okay, so concentration slips about once a week without a clear cause. With that and feeling low energy, I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling down on yourself or carrying guilt more than usual lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have some occasional feelings like that, but they aren\u2019t overwhelming or really getting in the way of things most of the time.\nDoctor: Got it, so these feelings pop up now and then but don\u2019t overwhelm you. How often would you say they come up? Anything usually set them off? And do you notice any physical signs when that happens or ways you try to handle it?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, usually without any clear reason. Physically, it\u2019s subtle\u2014just a little tension or tiredness sometimes. I try to manage it quietly on my own, so it doesn\u2019t become a problem for others.\nDoctor: Alright, once a week, subtle physical stuff, and you keep it to yourself. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014like eating more or less than usual, or any recent weight shifts?\nPatient: Nothing significant, maybe just a minor change now and then, but nothing really noticeable.\nDoctor: Okay, so appetite and weight are mostly stable. Have you been feeling sad, empty, or hopeless lately?\nPatient: Occasionally, I do feel a bit sad or empty, but it\u2019s not frequent or overwhelming. I manage to keep things under control most of the time.\nDoctor: You say those sad or empty feelings come up sometimes\u2014how often exactly? And when they hit, would you say they\u2019re mild, moderate, or pretty intense? Do they ever make it hard to get through your day, or are you able to keep going okay?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, and I\u2019d say they\u2019re usually mild. They\u2019re unpleasant, but I can still get through my day and manage my responsibilities without much trouble.\nDoctor: Once a week and mostly mild, got it. Are there any particular times, places, or events that tend to bring on those feelings? Do they come on suddenly, or do you notice anything that signals they\u2019re about to start?\nPatient: Not really\u2014there\u2019s no clear pattern or specific event that I can point to. The feelings usually come on gradually rather than all at once. I try to handle them quietly so they don\u2019t become a burden to others.\nDoctor: Alright, no clear triggers and it builds up slowly. I need to ask\u2014have you had any thoughts about death, hurting yourself, or suicide lately?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straight with me about that\u2014that\u2019s important. Since you\u2019re managing to keep things moving, how do you usually cope when these low feelings or fatigue come up during the day?\nPatient: I try to manage things quietly on my own\u2014usually by taking a moment to pause or focus on practical tasks. I prefer not to involve others much so I don\u2019t cause extra concern or burden.\nDoctor: You handle it on your own with pauses and practical tasks, alright.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I've just been feeling a bit off\u2014mostly tired and having some trouble sleeping. It's nothing too severe, but it\u2019s been enough to notice. My energy has been kind of low, and that's been a bit frustrating.\nDoctor: Okay, when you say trouble sleeping, do you mean you can\u2019t fall asleep, you wake up during the night, or you\u2019re up way too early? And how often is this happening? Also, this low energy\u2014how much is it messing with your day-to-day stuff or work?\nPatient: I tend to wake up during the night, though it\u2019s not every night. It\u2019s enough to be noticeable but not consistent. As for the low energy, it does affect my concentration at work sometimes, making it harder to focus, but I manage to keep up with things without major problems.\nDoctor: You said concentration is a bit off sometimes\u2014how often do you find it hard to focus or make decisions? And is it affecting your work or daily life beyond just being annoying?\nPatient: It happens occasionally, not too often. When it does, it\u2019s a bit bothersome, but I\u2019m still able to get my work done and manage things day to day without much trouble.\nDoctor: So it\u2019s happening now and then, nothing constant\u2014that makes sense. But when you say \u2018occasionally,\u2019 are we talking once a week, a few times a month? And have you noticed if it\u2019s worse in certain situations or times of day?\nPatient: It\u2019s about once a week, more or less. I haven\u2019t noticed any specific pattern or particular triggers that seem to make it worse.\nDoctor: Okay, so concentration slips about once a week without a clear cause. With that and feeling low energy, I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling down on yourself or carrying guilt more than usual lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have some occasional feelings like that, but they aren\u2019t overwhelming or really getting in the way of things most of the time.\nDoctor: Got it, so these feelings pop up now and then but don\u2019t overwhelm you. How often would you say they come up? Anything usually set them off? And do you notice any physical signs when that happens or ways you try to handle it?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, usually without any clear reason. Physically, it\u2019s subtle\u2014just a little tension or tiredness sometimes. I try to manage it quietly on my own, so it doesn\u2019t become a problem for others.\nDoctor: Alright, once a week, subtle physical stuff, and you keep it to yourself. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014like eating more or less than usual, or any recent weight shifts?\nPatient: Nothing significant, maybe just a minor change now and then, but nothing really noticeable.\nDoctor: Okay, so appetite and weight are mostly stable. Have you been feeling sad, empty, or hopeless lately?\nPatient: Occasionally, I do feel a bit sad or empty, but it\u2019s not frequent or overwhelming. I manage to keep things under control most of the time.\nDoctor: You say those sad or empty feelings come up sometimes\u2014how often exactly? And when they hit, would you say they\u2019re mild, moderate, or pretty intense? Do they ever make it hard to get through your day, or are you able to keep going okay?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, and I\u2019d say they\u2019re usually mild. They\u2019re unpleasant, but I can still get through my day and manage my responsibilities without much trouble.\nDoctor: Once a week and mostly mild, got it. Are there any particular times, places, or events that tend to bring on those feelings? Do they come on suddenly, or do you notice anything that signals they\u2019re about to start?\nPatient: Not really\u2014there\u2019s no clear pattern or specific event that I can point to. The feelings usually come on gradually rather than all at once. I try to handle them quietly so they don\u2019t become a burden to others.\nDoctor: Alright, no clear triggers and it builds up slowly. I need to ask\u2014have you had any thoughts about death, hurting yourself, or suicide lately?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straight with me about that\u2014that\u2019s important. Since you\u2019re managing to keep things moving, how do you usually cope when these low feelings or fatigue come up during the day?\nPatient: I try to manage things quietly on my own\u2014usually by taking a moment to pause or focus on practical tasks. I prefer not to involve others much so I don\u2019t cause extra concern or burden.\nDoctor: You handle it on your own with pauses and practical tasks, alright. Have you noticed any changes in your movements or behavior\u2014like feeling restless, slowed down, or just different than usual physically?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes like that.\nDoctor: Okay, no big shifts in how you move or act. What about things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or taking less pleasure in hobbies, socializing, or anything you typically like?\nPatient: No, I still keep up with my usual activities and socializing, even if my energy isn\u2019t always at its best.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nNo, I still keep up with my usual activities and socializing, even if my energy isn\u2019t always at its best.",

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

My energy has been kind of low, and that's been a bit frustrating.\nDoctor: Okay, when you say trouble sleeping, do you mean you can\u2019t fall asleep, you wake up during the night, or you\u2019re up way too early? And how often is this happening? Also, this low energy\u2014how much is it messing with your day-to-day stuff or work?\nPatient: I tend to wake up during the night, though it\u2019s not every night. It\u2019s enough to be noticeable but not consistent. As for the low energy, it does affect my concentration at work sometimes, making it harder to focus, but I manage to keep up with things without major problems.\nDoctor: You said concentration is a bit off sometimes\u2014how often do you find it hard to focus or make decisions? And is it affecting your work or daily life beyond just being annoying?\nPatient: It happens occasionally, not too often. When it does, it\u2019s a bit bothersome, but I\u2019m still able to get my work done and manage things day to day without much trouble.\nDoctor: So it\u2019s happening now and then, nothing constant\u2014that makes sense. But when you say \u2018occasionally,\u2019 are we talking once a week, a few times a month? And have you noticed if it\u2019s worse in certain situations or times of day?\nPatient: It\u2019s about once a week, more or less. I haven\u2019t noticed any specific pattern or particular triggers that seem to make it worse.\nDoctor: Okay, so concentration slips about once a week without a clear cause. With that and feeling low energy, I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling down on yourself or carrying guilt more than usual lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have some occasional feelings like that, but they aren\u2019t overwhelming or really getting in the way of things most of the time.\nDoctor: Got it, so these feelings pop up now and then but don\u2019t overwhelm you. How often would you say they come up? Anything usually set them off? And do you notice any physical signs when that happens or ways you try to handle it?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, usually without any clear reason. Physically, it\u2019s subtle\u2014just a little tension or tiredness sometimes. I try to manage it quietly on my own, so it doesn\u2019t become a problem for others.\nDoctor: Alright, once a week, subtle physical stuff, and you keep it to yourself. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014like eating more or less than usual, or any recent weight shifts?\nPatient: Nothing significant, maybe just a minor change now and then, but nothing really noticeable.\nDoctor: Okay, so appetite and weight are mostly stable. Have you been feeling sad, empty, or hopeless lately?\nPatient: Occasionally, I do feel a bit sad or empty, but it\u2019s not frequent or overwhelming. I manage to keep things under control most of the time.\nDoctor: You say those sad or empty feelings come up sometimes\u2014how often exactly? And when they hit, would you say they\u2019re mild, moderate, or pretty intense? Do they ever make it hard to get through your day, or are you able to keep going okay?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, and I\u2019d say they\u2019re usually mild. They\u2019re unpleasant, but I can still get through my day and manage my responsibilities without much trouble.\nDoctor: Once a week and mostly mild, got it. Are there any particular times, places, or events that tend to bring on those feelings? Do they come on suddenly, or do you notice anything that signals they\u2019re about to start?\nPatient: Not really\u2014there\u2019s no clear pattern or specific event that I can point to. The feelings usually come on gradually rather than all at once. I try to handle them quietly so they don\u2019t become a burden to others.\nDoctor: Alright, no clear triggers and it builds up slowly. I need to ask\u2014have you had any thoughts about death, hurting yourself, or suicide lately?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straight with me about that\u2014that\u2019s important. Since you\u2019re managing to keep things moving, how do you usually cope when these low feelings or fatigue come up during the day?\nPatient: I try to manage things quietly on my own\u2014usually by taking a moment to pause or focus on practical tasks. I prefer not to involve others much so I don\u2019t cause extra concern or burden.\nDoctor: You handle it on your own with pauses and practical tasks, alright. Have you noticed any changes in your movements or behavior\u2014like feeling restless, slowed down, or just different than usual physically?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes like that.\nDoctor: Okay, no big shifts in how you move or act. What about things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or taking less pleasure in hobbies, socializing, or anything you typically like?\nPatient: No, I still keep up with my usual activities and socializing, even if my energy isn\u2019t always at its best.\nDoctor: Good to hear you\u2019re still keeping up with your activities and social life even with the low energy.

My energy has been kind of low, and that's been a bit frustrating.\nDoctor: Okay, when you say trouble sleeping, do you mean you can\u2019t fall asleep, you wake up during the night, or you\u2019re up way too early? And how often is this happening? Also, this low energy\u2014how much is it messing with your day-to-day stuff or work?\nPatient: I tend to wake up during the night, though it\u2019s not every night. It\u2019s enough to be noticeable but not consistent. As for the low energy, it does affect my concentration at work sometimes, making it harder to focus, but I manage to keep up with things without major problems.\nDoctor: You said concentration is a bit off sometimes\u2014how often do you find it hard to focus or make decisions? And is it affecting your work or daily life beyond just being annoying?\nPatient: It happens occasionally, not too often. When it does, it\u2019s a bit bothersome, but I\u2019m still able to get my work done and manage things day to day without much trouble.\nDoctor: So it\u2019s happening now and then, nothing constant\u2014that makes sense. But when you say \u2018occasionally,\u2019 are we talking once a week, a few times a month? And have you noticed if it\u2019s worse in certain situations or times of day?\nPatient: It\u2019s about once a week, more or less. I haven\u2019t noticed any specific pattern or particular triggers that seem to make it worse.\nDoctor: Okay, so concentration slips about once a week without a clear cause. With that and feeling low energy, I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling down on yourself or carrying guilt more than usual lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have some occasional feelings like that, but they aren\u2019t overwhelming or really getting in the way of things most of the time.\nDoctor: Got it, so these feelings pop up now and then but don\u2019t overwhelm you. How often would you say they come up? Anything usually set them off? And do you notice any physical signs when that happens or ways you try to handle it?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, usually without any clear reason. Physically, it\u2019s subtle\u2014just a little tension or tiredness sometimes. I try to manage it quietly on my own, so it doesn\u2019t become a problem for others.\nDoctor: Alright, once a week, subtle physical stuff, and you keep it to yourself. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014like eating more or less than usual, or any recent weight shifts?\nPatient: Nothing significant, maybe just a minor change now and then, but nothing really noticeable.\nDoctor: Okay, so appetite and weight are mostly stable. Have you been feeling sad, empty, or hopeless lately?\nPatient: Occasionally, I do feel a bit sad or empty, but it\u2019s not frequent or overwhelming. I manage to keep things under control most of the time.\nDoctor: You say those sad or empty feelings come up sometimes\u2014how often exactly? And when they hit, would you say they\u2019re mild, moderate, or pretty intense? Do they ever make it hard to get through your day, or are you able to keep going okay?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, and I\u2019d say they\u2019re usually mild. They\u2019re unpleasant, but I can still get through my day and manage my responsibilities without much trouble.\nDoctor: Once a week and mostly mild, got it. Are there any particular times, places, or events that tend to bring on those feelings? Do they come on suddenly, or do you notice anything that signals they\u2019re about to start?\nPatient: Not really\u2014there\u2019s no clear pattern or specific event that I can point to. The feelings usually come on gradually rather than all at once. I try to handle them quietly so they don\u2019t become a burden to others.\nDoctor: Alright, no clear triggers and it builds up slowly. I need to ask\u2014have you had any thoughts about death, hurting yourself, or suicide lately?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straight with me about that\u2014that\u2019s important. Since you\u2019re managing to keep things moving, how do you usually cope when these low feelings or fatigue come up during the day?\nPatient: I try to manage things quietly on my own\u2014usually by taking a moment to pause or focus on practical tasks. I prefer not to involve others much so I don\u2019t cause extra concern or burden.\nDoctor: You handle it on your own with pauses and practical tasks, alright. Have you noticed any changes in your movements or behavior\u2014like feeling restless, slowed down, or just different than usual physically?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes like that.\nDoctor: Okay, no big shifts in how you move or act. What about things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or taking less pleasure in hobbies, socializing, or anything you typically like?\nPatient: No, I still keep up with my usual activities and socializing, even if my energy isn\u2019t always at its best.\nDoctor: Good to hear you\u2019re still keeping up with your activities and social life even with the low energy. That takes some grit. What do you think helps you push through when things get tough?\nPatient: I focus on staying on top of my responsibilities and try to keep moving forward without making a fuss. I prefer to handle things quietly on my own to avoid putting any extra pressure on those around me.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019ve taken on a heavy load and are doing your best to carry it without dragging others down\u2014that\u2019s not easy.

What about things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or taking less pleasure in hobbies, socializing, or anything you typically like?\nPatient: No, I still keep up with my usual activities and socializing, even if my energy isn\u2019t always at its best.\nDoctor: Good to hear you\u2019re still keeping up with your activities and social life even with the low energy. That takes some grit. What do you think helps you push through when things get tough?\nPatient: I focus on staying on top of my responsibilities and try to keep moving forward without making a fuss.

My energy has been kind of low, and that's been a bit frustrating.\nDoctor: Okay, when you say trouble sleeping, do you mean you can\u2019t fall asleep, you wake up during the night, or you\u2019re up way too early? And how often is this happening? Also, this low energy\u2014how much is it messing with your day-to-day stuff or work?\nPatient: I tend to wake up during the night, though it\u2019s not every night. It\u2019s enough to be noticeable but not consistent. As for the low energy, it does affect my concentration at work sometimes, making it harder to focus, but I manage to keep up with things without major problems.\nDoctor: You said concentration is a bit off sometimes\u2014how often do you find it hard to focus or make decisions? And is it affecting your work or daily life beyond just being annoying?\nPatient: It happens occasionally, not too often. When it does, it\u2019s a bit bothersome, but I\u2019m still able to get my work done and manage things day to day without much trouble.\nDoctor: So it\u2019s happening now and then, nothing constant\u2014that makes sense. But when you say \u2018occasionally,\u2019 are we talking once a week, a few times a month? And have you noticed if it\u2019s worse in certain situations or times of day?\nPatient: It\u2019s about once a week, more or less. I haven\u2019t noticed any specific pattern or particular triggers that seem to make it worse.\nDoctor: Okay, so concentration slips about once a week without a clear cause. With that and feeling low energy, I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling down on yourself or carrying guilt more than usual lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have some occasional feelings like that, but they aren\u2019t overwhelming or really getting in the way of things most of the time.\nDoctor: Got it, so these feelings pop up now and then but don\u2019t overwhelm you. How often would you say they come up? Anything usually set them off? And do you notice any physical signs when that happens or ways you try to handle it?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, usually without any clear reason. Physically, it\u2019s subtle\u2014just a little tension or tiredness sometimes. I try to manage it quietly on my own, so it doesn\u2019t become a problem for others.\nDoctor: Alright, once a week, subtle physical stuff, and you keep it to yourself. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014like eating more or less than usual, or any recent weight shifts?\nPatient: Nothing significant, maybe just a minor change now and then, but nothing really noticeable.\nDoctor: Okay, so appetite and weight are mostly stable. Have you been feeling sad, empty, or hopeless lately?\nPatient: Occasionally, I do feel a bit sad or empty, but it\u2019s not frequent or overwhelming. I manage to keep things under control most of the time.\nDoctor: You say those sad or empty feelings come up sometimes\u2014how often exactly? And when they hit, would you say they\u2019re mild, moderate, or pretty intense? Do they ever make it hard to get through your day, or are you able to keep going okay?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, and I\u2019d say they\u2019re usually mild. They\u2019re unpleasant, but I can still get through my day and manage my responsibilities without much trouble.\nDoctor: Once a week and mostly mild, got it. Are there any particular times, places, or events that tend to bring on those feelings? Do they come on suddenly, or do you notice anything that signals they\u2019re about to start?\nPatient: Not really\u2014there\u2019s no clear pattern or specific event that I can point to. The feelings usually come on gradually rather than all at once. I try to handle them quietly so they don\u2019t become a burden to others.\nDoctor: Alright, no clear triggers and it builds up slowly. I need to ask\u2014have you had any thoughts about death, hurting yourself, or suicide lately?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straight with me about that\u2014that\u2019s important. Since you\u2019re managing to keep things moving, how do you usually cope when these low feelings or fatigue come up during the day?\nPatient: I try to manage things quietly on my own\u2014usually by taking a moment to pause or focus on practical tasks. I prefer not to involve others much so I don\u2019t cause extra concern or burden.\nDoctor: You handle it on your own with pauses and practical tasks, alright.

I haven\u2019t noticed any specific pattern or particular triggers that seem to make it worse.\nDoctor: Okay, so concentration slips about once a week without a clear cause. With that and feeling low energy, I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling down on yourself or carrying guilt more than usual lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have some occasional feelings like that, but they aren\u2019t overwhelming or really getting in the way of things most of the time.\nDoctor: Got it, so these feelings pop up now and then but don\u2019t overwhelm you. How often would you say they come up? Anything usually set them off? And do you notice any physical signs when that happens or ways you try to handle it?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, usually without any clear reason. Physically, it\u2019s subtle\u2014just a little tension or tiredness sometimes. I try to manage it quietly on my own, so it doesn\u2019t become a problem for others.\nDoctor: Alright, once a week, subtle physical stuff, and you keep it to yourself. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014like eating more or less than usual, or any recent weight shifts?\nPatient: Nothing significant, maybe just a minor change now and then, but nothing really noticeable.\nDoctor: Okay, so appetite and weight are mostly stable. Have you been feeling sad, empty, or hopeless lately?\nPatient: Occasionally, I do feel a bit sad or empty, but it\u2019s not frequent or overwhelming. I manage to keep things under control most of the time.\nDoctor: You say those sad or empty feelings come up sometimes\u2014how often exactly? And when they hit, would you say they\u2019re mild, moderate, or pretty intense? Do they ever make it hard to get through your day, or are you able to keep going okay?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, and I\u2019d say they\u2019re usually mild. They\u2019re unpleasant, but I can still get through my day and manage my responsibilities without much trouble.\nDoctor: Once a week and mostly mild, got it. Are there any particular times, places, or events that tend to bring on those feelings? Do they come on suddenly, or do you notice anything that signals they\u2019re about to start?\nPatient: Not really\u2014there\u2019s no clear pattern or specific event that I can point to. The feelings usually come on gradually rather than all at once. I try to handle them quietly so they don\u2019t become a burden to others.\nDoctor: Alright, no clear triggers and it builds up slowly. I need to ask\u2014have you had any thoughts about death, hurting yourself, or suicide lately?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straight with me about that\u2014that\u2019s important. Since you\u2019re managing to keep things moving, how do you usually cope when these low feelings or fatigue come up during the day?\nPatient: I try to manage things quietly on my own\u2014usually by taking a moment to pause or focus on practical tasks. I prefer not to involve others much so I don\u2019t cause extra concern or burden.\nDoctor: You handle it on your own with pauses and practical tasks, alright. Have you noticed any changes in your movements or behavior\u2014like feeling restless, slowed down, or just different than usual physically?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes like that.\nDoctor: Okay, no big shifts in how you move or act. What about things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or taking less pleasure in hobbies, socializing, or anything you typically like?\nPatient: No, I still keep up with my usual activities and socializing, even if my energy isn\u2019t always at its best.\nDoctor: Good to hear you\u2019re still keeping up with your activities and social life even with the low energy. That takes some grit. What do you think helps you push through when things get tough?\nPatient: I focus on staying on top of my responsibilities and try to keep moving forward without making a fuss. I prefer to handle things quietly on my own to avoid putting any extra pressure on those around me.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019ve taken on a heavy load and are doing your best to carry it without dragging others down\u2014that\u2019s not easy. I get that handling things solo can feel like both a strength and a weight. If you ever want to talk more about how that feels, I\u2019m here.\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. It is challenging at times, but I\u2019m used to managing quietly and try not to burden others with it. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\nDoctor: Alright, circling back to your sleep\u2014how often do you wake up restless or restless sleep? And on a day-to-day basis, how tired do you feel? Does it seem to affect your mood or how you get through the day?\nPatient: I wake up restless a few times a week, but not every night. I do feel tired most days, which kind of drags on my mood quietly, but it doesn\u2019t stop me from getting through my day. I handle it mostly on my own, without making a big deal out of it.\nDoctor: You\u2019re waking up restless a few times a week and feeling tired most days, but still managing. How does that tiredness hit you during the day\u2014does it come in waves, or is it steady? And does it mess with any specific tasks or responsibilities?

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I've just been feeling a bit off\u2014mostly tired and having some trouble sleeping. It's nothing too severe, but it\u2019s been enough to notice. My energy has been kind of low, and that's been a bit frustrating.\nDoctor: Okay, when you say trouble sleeping, do you mean you can\u2019t fall asleep, you wake up during the night, or you\u2019re up way too early? And how often is this happening? Also, this low energy\u2014how much is it messing with your day-to-day stuff or work?\nPatient: I tend to wake up during the night, though it\u2019s not every night. It\u2019s enough to be noticeable but not consistent. As for the low energy, it does affect my concentration at work sometimes, making it harder to focus, but I manage to keep up with things without major problems.\nDoctor: You said concentration is a bit off sometimes\u2014how often do you find it hard to focus or make decisions? And is it affecting your work or daily life beyond just being annoying?\nPatient: It happens occasionally, not too often. When it does, it\u2019s a bit bothersome, but I\u2019m still able to get my work done and manage things day to day without much trouble.\nDoctor: So it\u2019s happening now and then, nothing constant\u2014that makes sense. But when you say \u2018occasionally,\u2019 are we talking once a week, a few times a month? And have you noticed if it\u2019s worse in certain situations or times of day?\nPatient: It\u2019s about once a week, more or less. I haven\u2019t noticed any specific pattern or particular triggers that seem to make it worse.\nDoctor: Okay, so concentration slips about once a week without a clear cause. With that and feeling low energy, I want to ask\u2014have you been feeling down on yourself or carrying guilt more than usual lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have some occasional feelings like that, but they aren\u2019t overwhelming or really getting in the way of things most of the time.\nDoctor: Got it, so these feelings pop up now and then but don\u2019t overwhelm you. How often would you say they come up? Anything usually set them off? And do you notice any physical signs when that happens or ways you try to handle it?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, usually without any clear reason. Physically, it\u2019s subtle\u2014just a little tension or tiredness sometimes. I try to manage it quietly on my own, so it doesn\u2019t become a problem for others.\nDoctor: Alright, once a week, subtle physical stuff, and you keep it to yourself. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately\u2014like eating more or less than usual, or any recent weight shifts?\nPatient: Nothing significant, maybe just a minor change now and then, but nothing really noticeable.\nDoctor: Okay, so appetite and weight are mostly stable. Have you been feeling sad, empty, or hopeless lately?\nPatient: Occasionally, I do feel a bit sad or empty, but it\u2019s not frequent or overwhelming. I manage to keep things under control most of the time.\nDoctor: You say those sad or empty feelings come up sometimes\u2014how often exactly? And when they hit, would you say they\u2019re mild, moderate, or pretty intense? Do they ever make it hard to get through your day, or are you able to keep going okay?\nPatient: They come up about once a week, and I\u2019d say they\u2019re usually mild. They\u2019re unpleasant, but I can still get through my day and manage my responsibilities without much trouble.\nDoctor: Once a week and mostly mild, got it. Are there any particular times, places, or events that tend to bring on those feelings? Do they come on suddenly, or do you notice anything that signals they\u2019re about to start?\nPatient: Not really\u2014there\u2019s no clear pattern or specific event that I can point to. The feelings usually come on gradually rather than all at once. I try to handle them quietly so they don\u2019t become a burden to others.\nDoctor: Alright, no clear triggers and it builds up slowly. I need to ask\u2014have you had any thoughts about death, hurting yourself, or suicide lately?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straight with me about that\u2014that\u2019s important. Since you\u2019re managing to keep things moving, how do you usually cope when these low feelings or fatigue come up during the day?\nPatient: I try to manage things quietly on my own\u2014usually by taking a moment to pause or focus on practical tasks. I prefer not to involve others much so I don\u2019t cause extra concern or burden.\nDoctor: You handle it on your own with pauses and practical tasks, alright. Have you noticed any changes in your movements or behavior\u2014like feeling restless, slowed down, or just different than usual physically?\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes like that.\nDoctor: Okay, no big shifts in how you move or act. What about things you usually enjoy\u2014have you found yourself less interested or taking less pleasure in hobbies, socializing, or anything you typically like?\nPatient: No, I still keep up with my usual activities and socializing, even if my energy isn\u2019t always at its best.\nDoctor: Good to hear you\u2019re still keeping up with your activities and social life even with the low energy. That takes some grit. What do you think helps you push through when things get tough?\nPatient: I focus on staying on top of my responsibilities and try to keep moving forward without making a fuss. I prefer to handle things quietly on my own to avoid putting any extra pressure on those around me.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019ve taken on a heavy load and are doing your best to carry it without dragging others down\u2014that\u2019s not easy. I get that handling things solo can feel like both a strength and a weight. If you ever want to talk more about how that feels, I\u2019m here.\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. It is challenging at times, but I\u2019m used to managing quietly and try not to burden others with it. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\nDoctor: Alright, circling back to your sleep\u2014how often do you wake up restless or restless sleep? And on a day-to-day basis, how tired do you feel? Does it seem to affect your mood or how you get through the day?\nPatient: I wake up restless a few times a week, but not every night. I do feel tired most days, which kind of drags on my mood quietly, but it doesn\u2019t stop me from getting through my day. I handle it mostly on my own, without making a big deal out of it.\nDoctor: You\u2019re waking up restless a few times a week and feeling tired most days, but still managing. How does that tiredness hit you during the day\u2014does it come in waves, or is it steady? And does it mess with any specific tasks or responsibilities? Anything else you do to cope with it?\nPatient: The tiredness feels more steady than in waves. It makes focusing and getting things done a bit more tiring, but I\u2019m still able to manage. I usually just take a moment to pause and focus on practical steps without involving others.\nDoctor: So this steady tiredness makes things feel more draining but you\u2019re still managing. How often would you say you feel fatigued or drained? And does it actually limit what you\u2019re able to do at all?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nSo this steady tiredness makes things feel more draining but you\u2019re still managing.
