Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

The biggest issue has been my sleep\u2014I can\u2019t seem to just switch off, and I\u2019m constantly restless, like my mind and body won\u2019t settle. It\u2019s exhausting and makes it really hard to concentrate on anything. Everything feels scattered and tense, and it just keeps piling up.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds really tough to be that restless night after night. How often do you find yourself unable to settle like this? What does a usual night of sleep look like for you these days? And those racing thoughts\u2014anything specific that tends to keep your mind buzzing? Also, how is this difficulty concentrating playing out during your day-to-day? Is it interfering with your work, or other parts of your routine?\nPatient: It\u2019s almost every single night\u2014there\u2019s barely been a moment in the past week where I managed to actually just fall asleep and stay asleep without tossing and turning for hours. My mind just keeps racing, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m fixated on any one thing\u2014it\u2019s just this never-ending stream of random worries, fears about what\u2019s next, things I should be doing but haven\u2019t, and it\u2019s all jumbled up and relentless. \n\nThat tired, wired feeling completely wrecks my focus during the day. At work or when I try to sketch or even just do something simple, my attention drifts everywhere. I can\u2019t hold onto an idea long enough to finish what I\u2019m doing, and that frustration just builds on itself. It\u2019s like my brain is stuck in this loop of agitation and distraction that doesn\u2019t give me a break. It\u2019s exhausting and honestly makes everything harder, not just work but daily life in general.\nDoctor: Jamie, with all that restless sleep and mental noise, I imagine your energy feels pretty drained. How have you been feeling during the day in terms of your overall fatigue or energy levels? Do you notice times when you feel completely worn out or unusually low on energy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely wiped out all day\u2014some days my energy bounces around, especially if I had a terrible night\u2019s sleep. But honestly, it\u2019s not that classic \u201cI just want to crash\u201d kind of fatigue. Instead, my body feels tense and wired, like even when I\u2019m tired, I can\u2019t just relax. The agitation keeps me on edge, so it\u2019s more like this restless buzz than real exhaustion. That\u2019s frustrating because it messes with any chance I have to actually feel settled or refreshed.\nDoctor: That restless, wired feeling you\u2019re describing\u2014it sounds really exhausting in its own way, Jamie. Not being able to truly relax even when your body feels tired must make everything feel heavier, like you\u2019re trapped in your own head.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days these past couple of weeks. The biggest issue has been my sleep\u2014I can\u2019t seem to just switch off, and I\u2019m constantly restless, like my mind and body won\u2019t settle. It\u2019s exhausting and makes it really hard to concentrate on anything. Everything feels scattered and tense, and it just keeps piling up.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds really tough to be that restless night after night. How often do you find yourself unable to settle like this? What does a usual night of sleep look like for you these days? And those racing thoughts\u2014anything specific that tends to keep your mind buzzing? Also, how is this difficulty concentrating playing out during your day-to-day? Is it interfering with your work, or other parts of your routine?\nPatient: It\u2019s almost every single night\u2014there\u2019s barely been a moment in the past week where I managed to actually just fall asleep and stay asleep without tossing and turning for hours. My mind just keeps racing, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m fixated on any one thing\u2014it\u2019s just this never-ending stream of random worries, fears about what\u2019s next, things I should be doing but haven\u2019t, and it\u2019s all jumbled up and relentless. \n\nThat tired, wired feeling completely wrecks my focus during the day. At work or when I try to sketch or even just do something simple, my attention drifts everywhere. I can\u2019t hold onto an idea long enough to finish what I\u2019m doing, and that frustration just builds on itself. It\u2019s like my brain is stuck in this loop of agitation and distraction that doesn\u2019t give me a break. It\u2019s exhausting and honestly makes everything harder, not just work but daily life in general.\nDoctor: Jamie, with all that restless sleep and mental noise, I imagine your energy feels pretty drained. How have you been feeling during the day in terms of your overall fatigue or energy levels? Do you notice times when you feel completely worn out or unusually low on energy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely wiped out all day\u2014some days my energy bounces around, especially if I had a terrible night\u2019s sleep. But honestly, it\u2019s not that classic \u201cI just want to crash\u201d kind of fatigue. Instead, my body feels tense and wired, like even when I\u2019m tired, I can\u2019t just relax. The agitation keeps me on edge, so it\u2019s more like this restless buzz than real exhaustion. That\u2019s frustrating because it messes with any chance I have to actually feel settled or refreshed.\nDoctor: That restless, wired feeling you\u2019re describing\u2014it sounds really exhausting in its own way, Jamie. Not being able to truly relax even when your body feels tired must make everything feel heavier, like you\u2019re trapped in your own head. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by not getting that sense of calm or refreshment you deserve.\nPatient: Exactly. It\u2019s beyond frustrating\u2014like I\u2019m stuck in this relentless loop where my body screams for rest but my mind refuses to shut down. I\u2019m physically drained, but that wired agitation drags me under even more. It\u2019s this exhausting, heavy weight that spills over into everything I do\u2014work, social stuff, even things I used to enjoy. It feels like no matter how hard I try, there\u2019s no escape from this constant buzzing misery. It\u2019s suffocating and\u2014honestly\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep dealing with it.\nDoctor: Jamie, it\u2019s hard to imagine carrying that kind of weight day in and day out. With all this exhaustion and agitation wearing you down, have you noticed if things or activities you used to enjoy don\u2019t feel the same anymore\u2014like you\u2019ve lost interest or pleasure in them?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nJamie, it\u2019s hard to imagine carrying that kind of weight day in and day out.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days these past couple of weeks. The biggest issue has been my sleep\u2014I can\u2019t seem to just switch off, and I\u2019m constantly restless, like my mind and body won\u2019t settle. It\u2019s exhausting and makes it really hard to concentrate on anything. Everything feels scattered and tense, and it just keeps piling up.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds really tough to be that restless night after night. How often do you find yourself unable to settle like this? What does a usual night of sleep look like for you these days? And those racing thoughts\u2014anything specific that tends to keep your mind buzzing? Also, how is this difficulty concentrating playing out during your day-to-day? Is it interfering with your work, or other parts of your routine?\nPatient: It\u2019s almost every single night\u2014there\u2019s barely been a moment in the past week where I managed to actually just fall asleep and stay asleep without tossing and turning for hours. My mind just keeps racing, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m fixated on any one thing\u2014it\u2019s just this never-ending stream of random worries, fears about what\u2019s next, things I should be doing but haven\u2019t, and it\u2019s all jumbled up and relentless. \n\nThat tired, wired feeling completely wrecks my focus during the day. At work or when I try to sketch or even just do something simple, my attention drifts everywhere. I can\u2019t hold onto an idea long enough to finish what I\u2019m doing, and that frustration just builds on itself. It\u2019s like my brain is stuck in this loop of agitation and distraction that doesn\u2019t give me a break. It\u2019s exhausting and honestly makes everything harder, not just work but daily life in general.\nDoctor: Jamie, with all that restless sleep and mental noise, I imagine your energy feels pretty drained. How have you been feeling during the day in terms of your overall fatigue or energy levels? Do you notice times when you feel completely worn out or unusually low on energy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely wiped out all day\u2014some days my energy bounces around, especially if I had a terrible night\u2019s sleep. But honestly, it\u2019s not that classic \u201cI just want to crash\u201d kind of fatigue. Instead, my body feels tense and wired, like even when I\u2019m tired, I can\u2019t just relax. The agitation keeps me on edge, so it\u2019s more like this restless buzz than real exhaustion. That\u2019s frustrating because it messes with any chance I have to actually feel settled or refreshed.\nDoctor: That restless, wired feeling you\u2019re describing\u2014it sounds really exhausting in its own way, Jamie. Not being able to truly relax even when your body feels tired must make everything feel heavier, like you\u2019re trapped in your own head. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by not getting that sense of calm or refreshment you deserve.\nPatient: Exactly. It\u2019s beyond frustrating\u2014like I\u2019m stuck in this relentless loop where my body screams for rest but my mind refuses to shut down. I\u2019m physically drained, but that wired agitation drags me under even more. It\u2019s this exhausting, heavy weight that spills over into everything I do\u2014work, social stuff, even things I used to enjoy. It feels like no matter how hard I try, there\u2019s no escape from this constant buzzing misery. It\u2019s suffocating and\u2014honestly\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep dealing with it.\nDoctor: Jamie, it\u2019s hard to imagine carrying that kind of weight day in and day out. With all this exhaustion and agitation wearing you down, have you noticed if things or activities you used to enjoy don\u2019t feel the same anymore\u2014like you\u2019ve lost interest or pleasure in them?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in the things I used to care about\u2014not totally. But that constant agitation and exhaustion makes it so damn hard to actually enjoy them. Like, I want to get into my sketching or messing around with music, but most of the time it just feels like I\u2019m pushing through a fog that saps whatever spark those things used to give me. It\u2019s frustrating because the interests are still there, but the tired, wired feeling keeps getting in the way, wearing me down almost every time.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing\u2014wanting to enjoy something but feeling pushed through like it\u2019s blocked\u2014that\u2019s a heavy space to be in, Jamie.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days these past couple of weeks. The biggest issue has been my sleep\u2014I can\u2019t seem to just switch off, and I\u2019m constantly restless, like my mind and body won\u2019t settle. It\u2019s exhausting and makes it really hard to concentrate on anything. Everything feels scattered and tense, and it just keeps piling up.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds really tough to be that restless night after night. How often do you find yourself unable to settle like this? What does a usual night of sleep look like for you these days? And those racing thoughts\u2014anything specific that tends to keep your mind buzzing? Also, how is this difficulty concentrating playing out during your day-to-day? Is it interfering with your work, or other parts of your routine?\nPatient: It\u2019s almost every single night\u2014there\u2019s barely been a moment in the past week where I managed to actually just fall asleep and stay asleep without tossing and turning for hours. My mind just keeps racing, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m fixated on any one thing\u2014it\u2019s just this never-ending stream of random worries, fears about what\u2019s next, things I should be doing but haven\u2019t, and it\u2019s all jumbled up and relentless. \n\nThat tired, wired feeling completely wrecks my focus during the day. At work or when I try to sketch or even just do something simple, my attention drifts everywhere. I can\u2019t hold onto an idea long enough to finish what I\u2019m doing, and that frustration just builds on itself. It\u2019s like my brain is stuck in this loop of agitation and distraction that doesn\u2019t give me a break. It\u2019s exhausting and honestly makes everything harder, not just work but daily life in general.\nDoctor: Jamie, with all that restless sleep and mental noise, I imagine your energy feels pretty drained. How have you been feeling during the day in terms of your overall fatigue or energy levels? Do you notice times when you feel completely worn out or unusually low on energy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely wiped out all day\u2014some days my energy bounces around, especially if I had a terrible night\u2019s sleep. But honestly, it\u2019s not that classic \u201cI just want to crash\u201d kind of fatigue. Instead, my body feels tense and wired, like even when I\u2019m tired, I can\u2019t just relax. The agitation keeps me on edge, so it\u2019s more like this restless buzz than real exhaustion. That\u2019s frustrating because it messes with any chance I have to actually feel settled or refreshed.\nDoctor: That restless, wired feeling you\u2019re describing\u2014it sounds really exhausting in its own way, Jamie. Not being able to truly relax even when your body feels tired must make everything feel heavier, like you\u2019re trapped in your own head. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by not getting that sense of calm or refreshment you deserve.\nPatient: Exactly. It\u2019s beyond frustrating\u2014like I\u2019m stuck in this relentless loop where my body screams for rest but my mind refuses to shut down. I\u2019m physically drained, but that wired agitation drags me under even more. It\u2019s this exhausting, heavy weight that spills over into everything I do\u2014work, social stuff, even things I used to enjoy. It feels like no matter how hard I try, there\u2019s no escape from this constant buzzing misery. It\u2019s suffocating and\u2014honestly\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep dealing with it.\nDoctor: Jamie, it\u2019s hard to imagine carrying that kind of weight day in and day out. With all this exhaustion and agitation wearing you down, have you noticed if things or activities you used to enjoy don\u2019t feel the same anymore\u2014like you\u2019ve lost interest or pleasure in them?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in the things I used to care about\u2014not totally. But that constant agitation and exhaustion makes it so damn hard to actually enjoy them. Like, I want to get into my sketching or messing around with music, but most of the time it just feels like I\u2019m pushing through a fog that saps whatever spark those things used to give me. It\u2019s frustrating because the interests are still there, but the tired, wired feeling keeps getting in the way, wearing me down almost every time.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing\u2014wanting to enjoy something but feeling pushed through like it\u2019s blocked\u2014that\u2019s a heavy space to be in, Jamie. With all that in mind, how often have you been feeling low or down, and how long has that feeling been sticking around?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling low pretty much most days for the past several weeks now. It\u2019s not like a sudden crash but more of this constant, dragging weight that just doesn\u2019t let up. That kind of mood wears you down slowly but thoroughly, and it\u2019s hard to shake off. It seeps into everything, making even small tasks feel like a battle, and I\u2019m tired of feeling stuck like this with no real break.\nDoctor: Jamie, carrying that slow, heavy weight day after day must be so draining, like moving through quicksand with no solid ground in sight. Feeling stuck and worn down like that takes a real toll\u2014it\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re exhausted and worn thin emotionally.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days these past couple of weeks. The biggest issue has been my sleep\u2014I can\u2019t seem to just switch off, and I\u2019m constantly restless, like my mind and body won\u2019t settle. It\u2019s exhausting and makes it really hard to concentrate on anything. Everything feels scattered and tense, and it just keeps piling up.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds really tough to be that restless night after night. How often do you find yourself unable to settle like this? What does a usual night of sleep look like for you these days? And those racing thoughts\u2014anything specific that tends to keep your mind buzzing? Also, how is this difficulty concentrating playing out during your day-to-day? Is it interfering with your work, or other parts of your routine?\nPatient: It\u2019s almost every single night\u2014there\u2019s barely been a moment in the past week where I managed to actually just fall asleep and stay asleep without tossing and turning for hours. My mind just keeps racing, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m fixated on any one thing\u2014it\u2019s just this never-ending stream of random worries, fears about what\u2019s next, things I should be doing but haven\u2019t, and it\u2019s all jumbled up and relentless. \n\nThat tired, wired feeling completely wrecks my focus during the day. At work or when I try to sketch or even just do something simple, my attention drifts everywhere. I can\u2019t hold onto an idea long enough to finish what I\u2019m doing, and that frustration just builds on itself. It\u2019s like my brain is stuck in this loop of agitation and distraction that doesn\u2019t give me a break. It\u2019s exhausting and honestly makes everything harder, not just work but daily life in general.\nDoctor: Jamie, with all that restless sleep and mental noise, I imagine your energy feels pretty drained. How have you been feeling during the day in terms of your overall fatigue or energy levels? Do you notice times when you feel completely worn out or unusually low on energy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely wiped out all day\u2014some days my energy bounces around, especially if I had a terrible night\u2019s sleep. But honestly, it\u2019s not that classic \u201cI just want to crash\u201d kind of fatigue. Instead, my body feels tense and wired, like even when I\u2019m tired, I can\u2019t just relax. The agitation keeps me on edge, so it\u2019s more like this restless buzz than real exhaustion. That\u2019s frustrating because it messes with any chance I have to actually feel settled or refreshed.\nDoctor: That restless, wired feeling you\u2019re describing\u2014it sounds really exhausting in its own way, Jamie. Not being able to truly relax even when your body feels tired must make everything feel heavier, like you\u2019re trapped in your own head. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by not getting that sense of calm or refreshment you deserve.\nPatient: Exactly. It\u2019s beyond frustrating\u2014like I\u2019m stuck in this relentless loop where my body screams for rest but my mind refuses to shut down. I\u2019m physically drained, but that wired agitation drags me under even more. It\u2019s this exhausting, heavy weight that spills over into everything I do\u2014work, social stuff, even things I used to enjoy. It feels like no matter how hard I try, there\u2019s no escape from this constant buzzing misery. It\u2019s suffocating and\u2014honestly\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep dealing with it.\nDoctor: Jamie, it\u2019s hard to imagine carrying that kind of weight day in and day out. With all this exhaustion and agitation wearing you down, have you noticed if things or activities you used to enjoy don\u2019t feel the same anymore\u2014like you\u2019ve lost interest or pleasure in them?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in the things I used to care about\u2014not totally. But that constant agitation and exhaustion makes it so damn hard to actually enjoy them. Like, I want to get into my sketching or messing around with music, but most of the time it just feels like I\u2019m pushing through a fog that saps whatever spark those things used to give me. It\u2019s frustrating because the interests are still there, but the tired, wired feeling keeps getting in the way, wearing me down almost every time.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing\u2014wanting to enjoy something but feeling pushed through like it\u2019s blocked\u2014that\u2019s a heavy space to be in, Jamie. With all that in mind, how often have you been feeling low or down, and how long has that feeling been sticking around?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling low pretty much most days for the past several weeks now. It\u2019s not like a sudden crash but more of this constant, dragging weight that just doesn\u2019t let up. That kind of mood wears you down slowly but thoroughly, and it\u2019s hard to shake off. It seeps into everything, making even small tasks feel like a battle, and I\u2019m tired of feeling stuck like this with no real break.\nDoctor: Jamie, carrying that slow, heavy weight day after day must be so draining, like moving through quicksand with no solid ground in sight. Feeling stuck and worn down like that takes a real toll\u2014it\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re exhausted and worn thin emotionally. What\u2019s it been like for you on a daily basis managing this heaviness? Have you found anything that helps even a little amidst all this?\nPatient: It feels like a constant battle every single day\u2014waking up to that same restless agitation and dragging exhaustion, and just trying to push through like it\u2019s some endless uphill fight. There\u2019s no real relief, no moment where it lets up enough for me to catch my breath. I\u2019ve tried different ways to cope\u2014music, sketching, sometimes just trying to force rest\u2014but none of it sticks or cuts through the buzz in my head. It just cycles back, over and over.

The agitation keeps me on edge, so it\u2019s more like this restless buzz than real exhaustion. That\u2019s frustrating because it messes with any chance I have to actually feel settled or refreshed.\nDoctor: That restless, wired feeling you\u2019re describing\u2014it sounds really exhausting in its own way, Jamie. Not being able to truly relax even when your body feels tired must make everything feel heavier, like you\u2019re trapped in your own head. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by not getting that sense of calm or refreshment you deserve.\nPatient: Exactly. It\u2019s beyond frustrating\u2014like I\u2019m stuck in this relentless loop where my body screams for rest but my mind refuses to shut down. I\u2019m physically drained, but that wired agitation drags me under even more. It\u2019s this exhausting, heavy weight that spills over into everything I do\u2014work, social stuff, even things I used to enjoy. It feels like no matter how hard I try, there\u2019s no escape from this constant buzzing misery. It\u2019s suffocating and\u2014honestly\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep dealing with it.\nDoctor: Jamie, it\u2019s hard to imagine carrying that kind of weight day in and day out. With all this exhaustion and agitation wearing you down, have you noticed if things or activities you used to enjoy don\u2019t feel the same anymore\u2014like you\u2019ve lost interest or pleasure in them?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in the things I used to care about\u2014not totally. But that constant agitation and exhaustion makes it so damn hard to actually enjoy them. Like, I want to get into my sketching or messing around with music, but most of the time it just feels like I\u2019m pushing through a fog that saps whatever spark those things used to give me. It\u2019s frustrating because the interests are still there, but the tired, wired feeling keeps getting in the way, wearing me down almost every time.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing\u2014wanting to enjoy something but feeling pushed through like it\u2019s blocked\u2014that\u2019s a heavy space to be in, Jamie. With all that in mind, how often have you been feeling low or down, and how long has that feeling been sticking around?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling low pretty much most days for the past several weeks now. It\u2019s not like a sudden crash but more of this constant, dragging weight that just doesn\u2019t let up. That kind of mood wears you down slowly but thoroughly, and it\u2019s hard to shake off. It seeps into everything, making even small tasks feel like a battle, and I\u2019m tired of feeling stuck like this with no real break.\nDoctor: Jamie, carrying that slow, heavy weight day after day must be so draining, like moving through quicksand with no solid ground in sight. Feeling stuck and worn down like that takes a real toll\u2014it\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re exhausted and worn thin emotionally. What\u2019s it been like for you on a daily basis managing this heaviness? Have you found anything that helps even a little amidst all this?\nPatient: It feels like a constant battle every single day\u2014waking up to that same restless agitation and dragging exhaustion, and just trying to push through like it\u2019s some endless uphill fight. There\u2019s no real relief, no moment where it lets up enough for me to catch my breath. I\u2019ve tried different ways to cope\u2014music, sketching, sometimes just trying to force rest\u2014but none of it sticks or cuts through the buzz in my head. It just cycles back, over and over. It\u2019s raw and brutal, honestly. I\u2019m worn thin, and this endless loop makes me feel trapped, like I\u2019m stuck in a cage with no way out. It\u2019s beyond draining, and sometimes I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can keep up the fight.\nDoctor: Jamie, what you\u2019re describing\u2014the nonstop struggle without a real break\u2014that\u2019s a heavy, relentless toll to bear. I want to check in on another area: have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately, either eating more or less than usual or any weight shifts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed some changes. It\u2019s not like a huge swing or anything drastic, but my appetite\u2019s been all over the place because of the agitation. Some days I barely feel like eating, and other times I force myself just to keep going. I\u2019ve skipped meals more than I\u2019d like because I\u2019m too restless or distracted. That just makes the tiredness worse and adds to the mess, and honestly, it\u2019s frustrating having to deal with that on top of everything else.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nYeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed some changes.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days these past couple of weeks. The biggest issue has been my sleep\u2014I can\u2019t seem to just switch off, and I\u2019m constantly restless, like my mind and body won\u2019t settle. It\u2019s exhausting and makes it really hard to concentrate on anything. Everything feels scattered and tense, and it just keeps piling up.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds really tough to be that restless night after night. How often do you find yourself unable to settle like this? What does a usual night of sleep look like for you these days? And those racing thoughts\u2014anything specific that tends to keep your mind buzzing? Also, how is this difficulty concentrating playing out during your day-to-day? Is it interfering with your work, or other parts of your routine?\nPatient: It\u2019s almost every single night\u2014there\u2019s barely been a moment in the past week where I managed to actually just fall asleep and stay asleep without tossing and turning for hours. My mind just keeps racing, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m fixated on any one thing\u2014it\u2019s just this never-ending stream of random worries, fears about what\u2019s next, things I should be doing but haven\u2019t, and it\u2019s all jumbled up and relentless. \n\nThat tired, wired feeling completely wrecks my focus during the day. At work or when I try to sketch or even just do something simple, my attention drifts everywhere. I can\u2019t hold onto an idea long enough to finish what I\u2019m doing, and that frustration just builds on itself. It\u2019s like my brain is stuck in this loop of agitation and distraction that doesn\u2019t give me a break. It\u2019s exhausting and honestly makes everything harder, not just work but daily life in general.\nDoctor: Jamie, with all that restless sleep and mental noise, I imagine your energy feels pretty drained. How have you been feeling during the day in terms of your overall fatigue or energy levels? Do you notice times when you feel completely worn out or unusually low on energy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely wiped out all day\u2014some days my energy bounces around, especially if I had a terrible night\u2019s sleep. But honestly, it\u2019s not that classic \u201cI just want to crash\u201d kind of fatigue. Instead, my body feels tense and wired, like even when I\u2019m tired, I can\u2019t just relax. The agitation keeps me on edge, so it\u2019s more like this restless buzz than real exhaustion. That\u2019s frustrating because it messes with any chance I have to actually feel settled or refreshed.\nDoctor: That restless, wired feeling you\u2019re describing\u2014it sounds really exhausting in its own way, Jamie. Not being able to truly relax even when your body feels tired must make everything feel heavier, like you\u2019re trapped in your own head. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by not getting that sense of calm or refreshment you deserve.\nPatient: Exactly. It\u2019s beyond frustrating\u2014like I\u2019m stuck in this relentless loop where my body screams for rest but my mind refuses to shut down. I\u2019m physically drained, but that wired agitation drags me under even more. It\u2019s this exhausting, heavy weight that spills over into everything I do\u2014work, social stuff, even things I used to enjoy. It feels like no matter how hard I try, there\u2019s no escape from this constant buzzing misery. It\u2019s suffocating and\u2014honestly\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep dealing with it.\nDoctor: Jamie, it\u2019s hard to imagine carrying that kind of weight day in and day out. With all this exhaustion and agitation wearing you down, have you noticed if things or activities you used to enjoy don\u2019t feel the same anymore\u2014like you\u2019ve lost interest or pleasure in them?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in the things I used to care about\u2014not totally. But that constant agitation and exhaustion makes it so damn hard to actually enjoy them. Like, I want to get into my sketching or messing around with music, but most of the time it just feels like I\u2019m pushing through a fog that saps whatever spark those things used to give me. It\u2019s frustrating because the interests are still there, but the tired, wired feeling keeps getting in the way, wearing me down almost every time.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing\u2014wanting to enjoy something but feeling pushed through like it\u2019s blocked\u2014that\u2019s a heavy space to be in, Jamie. With all that in mind, how often have you been feeling low or down, and how long has that feeling been sticking around?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling low pretty much most days for the past several weeks now. It\u2019s not like a sudden crash but more of this constant, dragging weight that just doesn\u2019t let up. That kind of mood wears you down slowly but thoroughly, and it\u2019s hard to shake off. It seeps into everything, making even small tasks feel like a battle, and I\u2019m tired of feeling stuck like this with no real break.\nDoctor: Jamie, carrying that slow, heavy weight day after day must be so draining, like moving through quicksand with no solid ground in sight. Feeling stuck and worn down like that takes a real toll\u2014it\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re exhausted and worn thin emotionally. What\u2019s it been like for you on a daily basis managing this heaviness? Have you found anything that helps even a little amidst all this?\nPatient: It feels like a constant battle every single day\u2014waking up to that same restless agitation and dragging exhaustion, and just trying to push through like it\u2019s some endless uphill fight. There\u2019s no real relief, no moment where it lets up enough for me to catch my breath. I\u2019ve tried different ways to cope\u2014music, sketching, sometimes just trying to force rest\u2014but none of it sticks or cuts through the buzz in my head. It just cycles back, over and over. It\u2019s raw and brutal, honestly. I\u2019m worn thin, and this endless loop makes me feel trapped, like I\u2019m stuck in a cage with no way out. It\u2019s beyond draining, and sometimes I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can keep up the fight.\nDoctor: Jamie, what you\u2019re describing\u2014the nonstop struggle without a real break\u2014that\u2019s a heavy, relentless toll to bear. I want to check in on another area: have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately, either eating more or less than usual or any weight shifts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed some changes. It\u2019s not like a huge swing or anything drastic, but my appetite\u2019s been all over the place because of the agitation. Some days I barely feel like eating, and other times I force myself just to keep going. I\u2019ve skipped meals more than I\u2019d like because I\u2019m too restless or distracted. That just makes the tiredness worse and adds to the mess, and honestly, it\u2019s frustrating having to deal with that on top of everything else.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds tough having your appetite swing like that\u2014some days you barely eat, others you\u2019re pushing yourself, which only adds to the exhaustion. Can you tell me how often you find yourself skipping meals or struggling to eat? And have you noticed any weight changes since this started? How do these shifts affect your mood or energy?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I skip meals fairly regularly\u2014at least a few times a week, maybe more when the restlessness hits hard. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m starving all the time, but the agitation and distraction make it hard to sit down and eat like I should. I\u2019ve noticed some mild weight changes\u2014not extreme, but enough that I can feel it\u2014and that just messes with my energy and mood even more. It\u2019s like one more thing piling onto everything else that\u2019s making this whole situation feel impossible to manage sometimes.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nI\u2019d say I skip meals fairly regularly\u2014at least a few times a week, maybe more when the restlessness hits hard.

It\u2019s beyond draining, and sometimes I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can keep up the fight.\nDoctor: Jamie, what you\u2019re describing\u2014the nonstop struggle without a real break\u2014that\u2019s a heavy, relentless toll to bear. I want to check in on another area: have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately, either eating more or less than usual or any weight shifts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed some changes. It\u2019s not like a huge swing or anything drastic, but my appetite\u2019s been all over the place because of the agitation. Some days I barely feel like eating, and other times I force myself just to keep going. I\u2019ve skipped meals more than I\u2019d like because I\u2019m too restless or distracted. That just makes the tiredness worse and adds to the mess, and honestly, it\u2019s frustrating having to deal with that on top of everything else.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds tough having your appetite swing like that\u2014some days you barely eat, others you\u2019re pushing yourself, which only adds to the exhaustion. Can you tell me how often you find yourself skipping meals or struggling to eat? And have you noticed any weight changes since this started? How do these shifts affect your mood or energy?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I skip meals fairly regularly\u2014at least a few times a week, maybe more when the restlessness hits hard. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m starving all the time, but the agitation and distraction make it hard to sit down and eat like I should. I\u2019ve noticed some mild weight changes\u2014not extreme, but enough that I can feel it\u2014and that just messes with my energy and mood even more. It\u2019s like one more thing piling onto everything else that\u2019s making this whole situation feel impossible to manage sometimes.\nDoctor: Jamie, juggling restlessness, skipping meals, mood shifts, and those subtle weight changes all at once\u2014no wonder this feels overwhelming and like too much to handle. It\u2019s completely natural to feel frustrated and worn down when everything seems to pile up like this.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days these past couple of weeks. The biggest issue has been my sleep\u2014I can\u2019t seem to just switch off, and I\u2019m constantly restless, like my mind and body won\u2019t settle. It\u2019s exhausting and makes it really hard to concentrate on anything. Everything feels scattered and tense, and it just keeps piling up.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds really tough to be that restless night after night. How often do you find yourself unable to settle like this? What does a usual night of sleep look like for you these days? And those racing thoughts\u2014anything specific that tends to keep your mind buzzing? Also, how is this difficulty concentrating playing out during your day-to-day? Is it interfering with your work, or other parts of your routine?\nPatient: It\u2019s almost every single night\u2014there\u2019s barely been a moment in the past week where I managed to actually just fall asleep and stay asleep without tossing and turning for hours. My mind just keeps racing, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m fixated on any one thing\u2014it\u2019s just this never-ending stream of random worries, fears about what\u2019s next, things I should be doing but haven\u2019t, and it\u2019s all jumbled up and relentless. \n\nThat tired, wired feeling completely wrecks my focus during the day. At work or when I try to sketch or even just do something simple, my attention drifts everywhere. I can\u2019t hold onto an idea long enough to finish what I\u2019m doing, and that frustration just builds on itself. It\u2019s like my brain is stuck in this loop of agitation and distraction that doesn\u2019t give me a break. It\u2019s exhausting and honestly makes everything harder, not just work but daily life in general.\nDoctor: Jamie, with all that restless sleep and mental noise, I imagine your energy feels pretty drained. How have you been feeling during the day in terms of your overall fatigue or energy levels? Do you notice times when you feel completely worn out or unusually low on energy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely wiped out all day\u2014some days my energy bounces around, especially if I had a terrible night\u2019s sleep. But honestly, it\u2019s not that classic \u201cI just want to crash\u201d kind of fatigue. Instead, my body feels tense and wired, like even when I\u2019m tired, I can\u2019t just relax. The agitation keeps me on edge, so it\u2019s more like this restless buzz than real exhaustion. That\u2019s frustrating because it messes with any chance I have to actually feel settled or refreshed.\nDoctor: That restless, wired feeling you\u2019re describing\u2014it sounds really exhausting in its own way, Jamie. Not being able to truly relax even when your body feels tired must make everything feel heavier, like you\u2019re trapped in your own head. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by not getting that sense of calm or refreshment you deserve.\nPatient: Exactly. It\u2019s beyond frustrating\u2014like I\u2019m stuck in this relentless loop where my body screams for rest but my mind refuses to shut down. I\u2019m physically drained, but that wired agitation drags me under even more. It\u2019s this exhausting, heavy weight that spills over into everything I do\u2014work, social stuff, even things I used to enjoy. It feels like no matter how hard I try, there\u2019s no escape from this constant buzzing misery. It\u2019s suffocating and\u2014honestly\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep dealing with it.\nDoctor: Jamie, it\u2019s hard to imagine carrying that kind of weight day in and day out. With all this exhaustion and agitation wearing you down, have you noticed if things or activities you used to enjoy don\u2019t feel the same anymore\u2014like you\u2019ve lost interest or pleasure in them?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in the things I used to care about\u2014not totally. But that constant agitation and exhaustion makes it so damn hard to actually enjoy them. Like, I want to get into my sketching or messing around with music, but most of the time it just feels like I\u2019m pushing through a fog that saps whatever spark those things used to give me. It\u2019s frustrating because the interests are still there, but the tired, wired feeling keeps getting in the way, wearing me down almost every time.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing\u2014wanting to enjoy something but feeling pushed through like it\u2019s blocked\u2014that\u2019s a heavy space to be in, Jamie. With all that in mind, how often have you been feeling low or down, and how long has that feeling been sticking around?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling low pretty much most days for the past several weeks now. It\u2019s not like a sudden crash but more of this constant, dragging weight that just doesn\u2019t let up. That kind of mood wears you down slowly but thoroughly, and it\u2019s hard to shake off. It seeps into everything, making even small tasks feel like a battle, and I\u2019m tired of feeling stuck like this with no real break.\nDoctor: Jamie, carrying that slow, heavy weight day after day must be so draining, like moving through quicksand with no solid ground in sight. Feeling stuck and worn down like that takes a real toll\u2014it\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re exhausted and worn thin emotionally. What\u2019s it been like for you on a daily basis managing this heaviness? Have you found anything that helps even a little amidst all this?\nPatient: It feels like a constant battle every single day\u2014waking up to that same restless agitation and dragging exhaustion, and just trying to push through like it\u2019s some endless uphill fight. There\u2019s no real relief, no moment where it lets up enough for me to catch my breath. I\u2019ve tried different ways to cope\u2014music, sketching, sometimes just trying to force rest\u2014but none of it sticks or cuts through the buzz in my head. It just cycles back, over and over.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days these past couple of weeks. The biggest issue has been my sleep\u2014I can\u2019t seem to just switch off, and I\u2019m constantly restless, like my mind and body won\u2019t settle. It\u2019s exhausting and makes it really hard to concentrate on anything. Everything feels scattered and tense, and it just keeps piling up.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds really tough to be that restless night after night. How often do you find yourself unable to settle like this? What does a usual night of sleep look like for you these days? And those racing thoughts\u2014anything specific that tends to keep your mind buzzing? Also, how is this difficulty concentrating playing out during your day-to-day? Is it interfering with your work, or other parts of your routine?\nPatient: It\u2019s almost every single night\u2014there\u2019s barely been a moment in the past week where I managed to actually just fall asleep and stay asleep without tossing and turning for hours. My mind just keeps racing, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m fixated on any one thing\u2014it\u2019s just this never-ending stream of random worries, fears about what\u2019s next, things I should be doing but haven\u2019t, and it\u2019s all jumbled up and relentless. \n\nThat tired, wired feeling completely wrecks my focus during the day. At work or when I try to sketch or even just do something simple, my attention drifts everywhere. I can\u2019t hold onto an idea long enough to finish what I\u2019m doing, and that frustration just builds on itself. It\u2019s like my brain is stuck in this loop of agitation and distraction that doesn\u2019t give me a break. It\u2019s exhausting and honestly makes everything harder, not just work but daily life in general.\nDoctor: Jamie, with all that restless sleep and mental noise, I imagine your energy feels pretty drained. How have you been feeling during the day in terms of your overall fatigue or energy levels? Do you notice times when you feel completely worn out or unusually low on energy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely wiped out all day\u2014some days my energy bounces around, especially if I had a terrible night\u2019s sleep. But honestly, it\u2019s not that classic \u201cI just want to crash\u201d kind of fatigue. Instead, my body feels tense and wired, like even when I\u2019m tired, I can\u2019t just relax. The agitation keeps me on edge, so it\u2019s more like this restless buzz than real exhaustion. That\u2019s frustrating because it messes with any chance I have to actually feel settled or refreshed.\nDoctor: That restless, wired feeling you\u2019re describing\u2014it sounds really exhausting in its own way, Jamie. Not being able to truly relax even when your body feels tired must make everything feel heavier, like you\u2019re trapped in your own head. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by not getting that sense of calm or refreshment you deserve.\nPatient: Exactly. It\u2019s beyond frustrating\u2014like I\u2019m stuck in this relentless loop where my body screams for rest but my mind refuses to shut down. I\u2019m physically drained, but that wired agitation drags me under even more. It\u2019s this exhausting, heavy weight that spills over into everything I do\u2014work, social stuff, even things I used to enjoy. It feels like no matter how hard I try, there\u2019s no escape from this constant buzzing misery. It\u2019s suffocating and\u2014honestly\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep dealing with it.\nDoctor: Jamie, it\u2019s hard to imagine carrying that kind of weight day in and day out. With all this exhaustion and agitation wearing you down, have you noticed if things or activities you used to enjoy don\u2019t feel the same anymore\u2014like you\u2019ve lost interest or pleasure in them?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in the things I used to care about\u2014not totally. But that constant agitation and exhaustion makes it so damn hard to actually enjoy them. Like, I want to get into my sketching or messing around with music, but most of the time it just feels like I\u2019m pushing through a fog that saps whatever spark those things used to give me. It\u2019s frustrating because the interests are still there, but the tired, wired feeling keeps getting in the way, wearing me down almost every time.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing\u2014wanting to enjoy something but feeling pushed through like it\u2019s blocked\u2014that\u2019s a heavy space to be in, Jamie. With all that in mind, how often have you been feeling low or down, and how long has that feeling been sticking around?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling low pretty much most days for the past several weeks now. It\u2019s not like a sudden crash but more of this constant, dragging weight that just doesn\u2019t let up. That kind of mood wears you down slowly but thoroughly, and it\u2019s hard to shake off. It seeps into everything, making even small tasks feel like a battle, and I\u2019m tired of feeling stuck like this with no real break.\nDoctor: Jamie, carrying that slow, heavy weight day after day must be so draining, like moving through quicksand with no solid ground in sight. Feeling stuck and worn down like that takes a real toll\u2014it\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re exhausted and worn thin emotionally. What\u2019s it been like for you on a daily basis managing this heaviness? Have you found anything that helps even a little amidst all this?\nPatient: It feels like a constant battle every single day\u2014waking up to that same restless agitation and dragging exhaustion, and just trying to push through like it\u2019s some endless uphill fight. There\u2019s no real relief, no moment where it lets up enough for me to catch my breath. I\u2019ve tried different ways to cope\u2014music, sketching, sometimes just trying to force rest\u2014but none of it sticks or cuts through the buzz in my head. It just cycles back, over and over. It\u2019s raw and brutal, honestly. I\u2019m worn thin, and this endless loop makes me feel trapped, like I\u2019m stuck in a cage with no way out. It\u2019s beyond draining, and sometimes I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can keep up the fight.\nDoctor: Jamie, what you\u2019re describing\u2014the nonstop struggle without a real break\u2014that\u2019s a heavy, relentless toll to bear. I want to check in on another area: have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately, either eating more or less than usual or any weight shifts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed some changes. It\u2019s not like a huge swing or anything drastic, but my appetite\u2019s been all over the place because of the agitation. Some days I barely feel like eating, and other times I force myself just to keep going. I\u2019ve skipped meals more than I\u2019d like because I\u2019m too restless or distracted. That just makes the tiredness worse and adds to the mess, and honestly, it\u2019s frustrating having to deal with that on top of everything else.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds tough having your appetite swing like that\u2014some days you barely eat, others you\u2019re pushing yourself, which only adds to the exhaustion. Can you tell me how often you find yourself skipping meals or struggling to eat? And have you noticed any weight changes since this started? How do these shifts affect your mood or energy?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I skip meals fairly regularly\u2014at least a few times a week, maybe more when the restlessness hits hard. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m starving all the time, but the agitation and distraction make it hard to sit down and eat like I should. I\u2019ve noticed some mild weight changes\u2014not extreme, but enough that I can feel it\u2014and that just messes with my energy and mood even more. It\u2019s like one more thing piling onto everything else that\u2019s making this whole situation feel impossible to manage sometimes.\nDoctor: Jamie, juggling restlessness, skipping meals, mood shifts, and those subtle weight changes all at once\u2014no wonder this feels overwhelming and like too much to handle. It\u2019s completely natural to feel frustrated and worn down when everything seems to pile up like this. You\u2019re dealing with a lot, and I\u2019m here to work through it with you.\nPatient: It\u2019s honestly crushing\u2014the nonstop restlessness, the appetite crap, the mood swings, it all just builds up into this weight that drags me down every single day. I\u2019m tired in ways I can\u2019t even fully put into words, like this raw exhaustion that leaks into everything I do. It\u2019s infuriating to feel trapped in this loop with no clear way out. But I appreciate that you\u2019re here and willing to listen\u2014it helps more than I can say, even if the struggle doesn\u2019t let up yet.\nDoctor: Jamie, I\u2019m really glad you feel comfortable sharing this with me\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to carry it alone. To help me understand better, have you noticed any changes in how your body moves or feels?

With all that in mind, how often have you been feeling low or down, and how long has that feeling been sticking around?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling low pretty much most days for the past several weeks now. It\u2019s not like a sudden crash but more of this constant, dragging weight that just doesn\u2019t let up. That kind of mood wears you down slowly but thoroughly, and it\u2019s hard to shake off. It seeps into everything, making even small tasks feel like a battle, and I\u2019m tired of feeling stuck like this with no real break.\nDoctor: Jamie, carrying that slow, heavy weight day after day must be so draining, like moving through quicksand with no solid ground in sight. Feeling stuck and worn down like that takes a real toll\u2014it\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re exhausted and worn thin emotionally. What\u2019s it been like for you on a daily basis managing this heaviness? Have you found anything that helps even a little amidst all this?\nPatient: It feels like a constant battle every single day\u2014waking up to that same restless agitation and dragging exhaustion, and just trying to push through like it\u2019s some endless uphill fight. There\u2019s no real relief, no moment where it lets up enough for me to catch my breath. I\u2019ve tried different ways to cope\u2014music, sketching, sometimes just trying to force rest\u2014but none of it sticks or cuts through the buzz in my head. It just cycles back, over and over. It\u2019s raw and brutal, honestly. I\u2019m worn thin, and this endless loop makes me feel trapped, like I\u2019m stuck in a cage with no way out. It\u2019s beyond draining, and sometimes I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can keep up the fight.\nDoctor: Jamie, what you\u2019re describing\u2014the nonstop struggle without a real break\u2014that\u2019s a heavy, relentless toll to bear. I want to check in on another area: have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately, either eating more or less than usual or any weight shifts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed some changes. It\u2019s not like a huge swing or anything drastic, but my appetite\u2019s been all over the place because of the agitation. Some days I barely feel like eating, and other times I force myself just to keep going. I\u2019ve skipped meals more than I\u2019d like because I\u2019m too restless or distracted. That just makes the tiredness worse and adds to the mess, and honestly, it\u2019s frustrating having to deal with that on top of everything else.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds tough having your appetite swing like that\u2014some days you barely eat, others you\u2019re pushing yourself, which only adds to the exhaustion. Can you tell me how often you find yourself skipping meals or struggling to eat? And have you noticed any weight changes since this started? How do these shifts affect your mood or energy?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I skip meals fairly regularly\u2014at least a few times a week, maybe more when the restlessness hits hard. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m starving all the time, but the agitation and distraction make it hard to sit down and eat like I should. I\u2019ve noticed some mild weight changes\u2014not extreme, but enough that I can feel it\u2014and that just messes with my energy and mood even more. It\u2019s like one more thing piling onto everything else that\u2019s making this whole situation feel impossible to manage sometimes.\nDoctor: Jamie, juggling restlessness, skipping meals, mood shifts, and those subtle weight changes all at once\u2014no wonder this feels overwhelming and like too much to handle. It\u2019s completely natural to feel frustrated and worn down when everything seems to pile up like this. You\u2019re dealing with a lot, and I\u2019m here to work through it with you.\nPatient: It\u2019s honestly crushing\u2014the nonstop restlessness, the appetite crap, the mood swings, it all just builds up into this weight that drags me down every single day. I\u2019m tired in ways I can\u2019t even fully put into words, like this raw exhaustion that leaks into everything I do. It\u2019s infuriating to feel trapped in this loop with no clear way out. But I appreciate that you\u2019re here and willing to listen\u2014it helps more than I can say, even if the struggle doesn\u2019t let up yet.\nDoctor: Jamie, I\u2019m really glad you feel comfortable sharing this with me\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to carry it alone. To help me understand better, have you noticed any changes in how your body moves or feels? Like feeling more restless, pacing, fidgeting, or maybe the opposite\u2014feeling physically or mentally slowed down? Understanding that piece can help us figure out the best ways to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like I\u2019m constantly on edge\u2014I find myself pacing around the room or fidgeting with whatever\u2019s nearby, just trying to get some relief from this tightness in my body. The tension never really lets up; my muscles are always tight, and sitting still feels impossible.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days these past couple of weeks. The biggest issue has been my sleep\u2014I can\u2019t seem to just switch off, and I\u2019m constantly restless, like my mind and body won\u2019t settle. It\u2019s exhausting and makes it really hard to concentrate on anything. Everything feels scattered and tense, and it just keeps piling up.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds really tough to be that restless night after night. How often do you find yourself unable to settle like this? What does a usual night of sleep look like for you these days? And those racing thoughts\u2014anything specific that tends to keep your mind buzzing? Also, how is this difficulty concentrating playing out during your day-to-day? Is it interfering with your work, or other parts of your routine?\nPatient: It\u2019s almost every single night\u2014there\u2019s barely been a moment in the past week where I managed to actually just fall asleep and stay asleep without tossing and turning for hours. My mind just keeps racing, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m fixated on any one thing\u2014it\u2019s just this never-ending stream of random worries, fears about what\u2019s next, things I should be doing but haven\u2019t, and it\u2019s all jumbled up and relentless. \n\nThat tired, wired feeling completely wrecks my focus during the day. At work or when I try to sketch or even just do something simple, my attention drifts everywhere. I can\u2019t hold onto an idea long enough to finish what I\u2019m doing, and that frustration just builds on itself. It\u2019s like my brain is stuck in this loop of agitation and distraction that doesn\u2019t give me a break. It\u2019s exhausting and honestly makes everything harder, not just work but daily life in general.\nDoctor: Jamie, with all that restless sleep and mental noise, I imagine your energy feels pretty drained. How have you been feeling during the day in terms of your overall fatigue or energy levels? Do you notice times when you feel completely worn out or unusually low on energy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely wiped out all day\u2014some days my energy bounces around, especially if I had a terrible night\u2019s sleep. But honestly, it\u2019s not that classic \u201cI just want to crash\u201d kind of fatigue. Instead, my body feels tense and wired, like even when I\u2019m tired, I can\u2019t just relax. The agitation keeps me on edge, so it\u2019s more like this restless buzz than real exhaustion. That\u2019s frustrating because it messes with any chance I have to actually feel settled or refreshed.\nDoctor: That restless, wired feeling you\u2019re describing\u2014it sounds really exhausting in its own way, Jamie. Not being able to truly relax even when your body feels tired must make everything feel heavier, like you\u2019re trapped in your own head. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by not getting that sense of calm or refreshment you deserve.\nPatient: Exactly. It\u2019s beyond frustrating\u2014like I\u2019m stuck in this relentless loop where my body screams for rest but my mind refuses to shut down. I\u2019m physically drained, but that wired agitation drags me under even more. It\u2019s this exhausting, heavy weight that spills over into everything I do\u2014work, social stuff, even things I used to enjoy. It feels like no matter how hard I try, there\u2019s no escape from this constant buzzing misery. It\u2019s suffocating and\u2014honestly\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep dealing with it.\nDoctor: Jamie, it\u2019s hard to imagine carrying that kind of weight day in and day out. With all this exhaustion and agitation wearing you down, have you noticed if things or activities you used to enjoy don\u2019t feel the same anymore\u2014like you\u2019ve lost interest or pleasure in them?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in the things I used to care about\u2014not totally. But that constant agitation and exhaustion makes it so damn hard to actually enjoy them. Like, I want to get into my sketching or messing around with music, but most of the time it just feels like I\u2019m pushing through a fog that saps whatever spark those things used to give me. It\u2019s frustrating because the interests are still there, but the tired, wired feeling keeps getting in the way, wearing me down almost every time.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing\u2014wanting to enjoy something but feeling pushed through like it\u2019s blocked\u2014that\u2019s a heavy space to be in, Jamie.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days these past couple of weeks. The biggest issue has been my sleep\u2014I can\u2019t seem to just switch off, and I\u2019m constantly restless, like my mind and body won\u2019t settle. It\u2019s exhausting and makes it really hard to concentrate on anything. Everything feels scattered and tense, and it just keeps piling up.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds really tough to be that restless night after night. How often do you find yourself unable to settle like this? What does a usual night of sleep look like for you these days? And those racing thoughts\u2014anything specific that tends to keep your mind buzzing? Also, how is this difficulty concentrating playing out during your day-to-day? Is it interfering with your work, or other parts of your routine?\nPatient: It\u2019s almost every single night\u2014there\u2019s barely been a moment in the past week where I managed to actually just fall asleep and stay asleep without tossing and turning for hours. My mind just keeps racing, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m fixated on any one thing\u2014it\u2019s just this never-ending stream of random worries, fears about what\u2019s next, things I should be doing but haven\u2019t, and it\u2019s all jumbled up and relentless. \n\nThat tired, wired feeling completely wrecks my focus during the day. At work or when I try to sketch or even just do something simple, my attention drifts everywhere. I can\u2019t hold onto an idea long enough to finish what I\u2019m doing, and that frustration just builds on itself. It\u2019s like my brain is stuck in this loop of agitation and distraction that doesn\u2019t give me a break. It\u2019s exhausting and honestly makes everything harder, not just work but daily life in general.\nDoctor: Jamie, with all that restless sleep and mental noise, I imagine your energy feels pretty drained. How have you been feeling during the day in terms of your overall fatigue or energy levels? Do you notice times when you feel completely worn out or unusually low on energy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely wiped out all day\u2014some days my energy bounces around, especially if I had a terrible night\u2019s sleep. But honestly, it\u2019s not that classic \u201cI just want to crash\u201d kind of fatigue. Instead, my body feels tense and wired, like even when I\u2019m tired, I can\u2019t just relax. The agitation keeps me on edge, so it\u2019s more like this restless buzz than real exhaustion. That\u2019s frustrating because it messes with any chance I have to actually feel settled or refreshed.\nDoctor: That restless, wired feeling you\u2019re describing\u2014it sounds really exhausting in its own way, Jamie. Not being able to truly relax even when your body feels tired must make everything feel heavier, like you\u2019re trapped in your own head. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by not getting that sense of calm or refreshment you deserve.\nPatient: Exactly. It\u2019s beyond frustrating\u2014like I\u2019m stuck in this relentless loop where my body screams for rest but my mind refuses to shut down. I\u2019m physically drained, but that wired agitation drags me under even more. It\u2019s this exhausting, heavy weight that spills over into everything I do\u2014work, social stuff, even things I used to enjoy. It feels like no matter how hard I try, there\u2019s no escape from this constant buzzing misery. It\u2019s suffocating and\u2014honestly\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep dealing with it.\nDoctor: Jamie, it\u2019s hard to imagine carrying that kind of weight day in and day out. With all this exhaustion and agitation wearing you down, have you noticed if things or activities you used to enjoy don\u2019t feel the same anymore\u2014like you\u2019ve lost interest or pleasure in them?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in the things I used to care about\u2014not totally. But that constant agitation and exhaustion makes it so damn hard to actually enjoy them. Like, I want to get into my sketching or messing around with music, but most of the time it just feels like I\u2019m pushing through a fog that saps whatever spark those things used to give me. It\u2019s frustrating because the interests are still there, but the tired, wired feeling keeps getting in the way, wearing me down almost every time.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing\u2014wanting to enjoy something but feeling pushed through like it\u2019s blocked\u2014that\u2019s a heavy space to be in, Jamie. With all that in mind, how often have you been feeling low or down, and how long has that feeling been sticking around?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling low pretty much most days for the past several weeks now. It\u2019s not like a sudden crash but more of this constant, dragging weight that just doesn\u2019t let up. That kind of mood wears you down slowly but thoroughly, and it\u2019s hard to shake off. It seeps into everything, making even small tasks feel like a battle, and I\u2019m tired of feeling stuck like this with no real break.\nDoctor: Jamie, carrying that slow, heavy weight day after day must be so draining, like moving through quicksand with no solid ground in sight. Feeling stuck and worn down like that takes a real toll\u2014it\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re exhausted and worn thin emotionally. What\u2019s it been like for you on a daily basis managing this heaviness? Have you found anything that helps even a little amidst all this?\nPatient: It feels like a constant battle every single day\u2014waking up to that same restless agitation and dragging exhaustion, and just trying to push through like it\u2019s some endless uphill fight. There\u2019s no real relief, no moment where it lets up enough for me to catch my breath. I\u2019ve tried different ways to cope\u2014music, sketching, sometimes just trying to force rest\u2014but none of it sticks or cuts through the buzz in my head. It just cycles back, over and over. It\u2019s raw and brutal, honestly. I\u2019m worn thin, and this endless loop makes me feel trapped, like I\u2019m stuck in a cage with no way out. It\u2019s beyond draining, and sometimes I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can keep up the fight.\nDoctor: Jamie, what you\u2019re describing\u2014the nonstop struggle without a real break\u2014that\u2019s a heavy, relentless toll to bear. I want to check in on another area: have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately, either eating more or less than usual or any weight shifts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed some changes. It\u2019s not like a huge swing or anything drastic, but my appetite\u2019s been all over the place because of the agitation. Some days I barely feel like eating, and other times I force myself just to keep going. I\u2019ve skipped meals more than I\u2019d like because I\u2019m too restless or distracted. That just makes the tiredness worse and adds to the mess, and honestly, it\u2019s frustrating having to deal with that on top of everything else.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds tough having your appetite swing like that\u2014some days you barely eat, others you\u2019re pushing yourself, which only adds to the exhaustion. Can you tell me how often you find yourself skipping meals or struggling to eat? And have you noticed any weight changes since this started? How do these shifts affect your mood or energy?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I skip meals fairly regularly\u2014at least a few times a week, maybe more when the restlessness hits hard. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m starving all the time, but the agitation and distraction make it hard to sit down and eat like I should. I\u2019ve noticed some mild weight changes\u2014not extreme, but enough that I can feel it\u2014and that just messes with my energy and mood even more. It\u2019s like one more thing piling onto everything else that\u2019s making this whole situation feel impossible to manage sometimes.\nDoctor: Jamie, juggling restlessness, skipping meals, mood shifts, and those subtle weight changes all at once\u2014no wonder this feels overwhelming and like too much to handle. It\u2019s completely natural to feel frustrated and worn down when everything seems to pile up like this. You\u2019re dealing with a lot, and I\u2019m here to work through it with you.\nPatient: It\u2019s honestly crushing\u2014the nonstop restlessness, the appetite crap, the mood swings, it all just builds up into this weight that drags me down every single day. I\u2019m tired in ways I can\u2019t even fully put into words, like this raw exhaustion that leaks into everything I do. It\u2019s infuriating to feel trapped in this loop with no clear way out. But I appreciate that you\u2019re here and willing to listen\u2014it helps more than I can say, even if the struggle doesn\u2019t let up yet.\nDoctor: Jamie, I\u2019m really glad you feel comfortable sharing this with me\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to carry it alone. To help me understand better, have you noticed any changes in how your body moves or feels? Like feeling more restless, pacing, fidgeting, or maybe the opposite\u2014feeling physically or mentally slowed down? Understanding that piece can help us figure out the best ways to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like I\u2019m constantly on edge\u2014I find myself pacing around the room or fidgeting with whatever\u2019s nearby, just trying to get some relief from this tightness in my body. The tension never really lets up; my muscles are always tight, and sitting still feels impossible. Sometimes my mind slows down for a moment, but mostly it\u2019s this restless agitation that dominates, making it hard to feel grounded or calm. It\u2019s exhausting because it\u2019s not just mental\u2014it\u2019s this heavy physical buzz that follows me all day and night, and it makes everything feel harder to manage.\nDoctor: Jamie, that constant physical tension and restlessness sound incredibly draining. How are these feelings impacting your ability to focus, think clearly, or make decisions throughout the day? Is it harder for you to stick with tasks or come to conclusions when your mind is racing like this?\nPatient: It\u2019s brutal. The restless buzz in my body and mind makes it almost impossible to focus or think straight. I\u2019m constantly jumping from one thought to another, and simple tasks suddenly feel like massive obstacles. Making decisions becomes this exhausting, overwhelming process because my brain just won\u2019t settle long enough to weigh things out properly.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days these past couple of weeks. The biggest issue has been my sleep\u2014I can\u2019t seem to just switch off, and I\u2019m constantly restless, like my mind and body won\u2019t settle. It\u2019s exhausting and makes it really hard to concentrate on anything. Everything feels scattered and tense, and it just keeps piling up.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds really tough to be that restless night after night. How often do you find yourself unable to settle like this? What does a usual night of sleep look like for you these days? And those racing thoughts\u2014anything specific that tends to keep your mind buzzing? Also, how is this difficulty concentrating playing out during your day-to-day? Is it interfering with your work, or other parts of your routine?\nPatient: It\u2019s almost every single night\u2014there\u2019s barely been a moment in the past week where I managed to actually just fall asleep and stay asleep without tossing and turning for hours. My mind just keeps racing, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m fixated on any one thing\u2014it\u2019s just this never-ending stream of random worries, fears about what\u2019s next, things I should be doing but haven\u2019t, and it\u2019s all jumbled up and relentless. \n\nThat tired, wired feeling completely wrecks my focus during the day. At work or when I try to sketch or even just do something simple, my attention drifts everywhere. I can\u2019t hold onto an idea long enough to finish what I\u2019m doing, and that frustration just builds on itself. It\u2019s like my brain is stuck in this loop of agitation and distraction that doesn\u2019t give me a break. It\u2019s exhausting and honestly makes everything harder, not just work but daily life in general.\nDoctor: Jamie, with all that restless sleep and mental noise, I imagine your energy feels pretty drained. How have you been feeling during the day in terms of your overall fatigue or energy levels? Do you notice times when you feel completely worn out or unusually low on energy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely wiped out all day\u2014some days my energy bounces around, especially if I had a terrible night\u2019s sleep. But honestly, it\u2019s not that classic \u201cI just want to crash\u201d kind of fatigue. Instead, my body feels tense and wired, like even when I\u2019m tired, I can\u2019t just relax. The agitation keeps me on edge, so it\u2019s more like this restless buzz than real exhaustion. That\u2019s frustrating because it messes with any chance I have to actually feel settled or refreshed.\nDoctor: That restless, wired feeling you\u2019re describing\u2014it sounds really exhausting in its own way, Jamie. Not being able to truly relax even when your body feels tired must make everything feel heavier, like you\u2019re trapped in your own head. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by not getting that sense of calm or refreshment you deserve.\nPatient: Exactly. It\u2019s beyond frustrating\u2014like I\u2019m stuck in this relentless loop where my body screams for rest but my mind refuses to shut down. I\u2019m physically drained, but that wired agitation drags me under even more. It\u2019s this exhausting, heavy weight that spills over into everything I do\u2014work, social stuff, even things I used to enjoy. It feels like no matter how hard I try, there\u2019s no escape from this constant buzzing misery. It\u2019s suffocating and\u2014honestly\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep dealing with it.\nDoctor: Jamie, it\u2019s hard to imagine carrying that kind of weight day in and day out. With all this exhaustion and agitation wearing you down, have you noticed if things or activities you used to enjoy don\u2019t feel the same anymore\u2014like you\u2019ve lost interest or pleasure in them?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in the things I used to care about\u2014not totally. But that constant agitation and exhaustion makes it so damn hard to actually enjoy them. Like, I want to get into my sketching or messing around with music, but most of the time it just feels like I\u2019m pushing through a fog that saps whatever spark those things used to give me. It\u2019s frustrating because the interests are still there, but the tired, wired feeling keeps getting in the way, wearing me down almost every time.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing\u2014wanting to enjoy something but feeling pushed through like it\u2019s blocked\u2014that\u2019s a heavy space to be in, Jamie. With all that in mind, how often have you been feeling low or down, and how long has that feeling been sticking around?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling low pretty much most days for the past several weeks now. It\u2019s not like a sudden crash but more of this constant, dragging weight that just doesn\u2019t let up. That kind of mood wears you down slowly but thoroughly, and it\u2019s hard to shake off. It seeps into everything, making even small tasks feel like a battle, and I\u2019m tired of feeling stuck like this with no real break.\nDoctor: Jamie, carrying that slow, heavy weight day after day must be so draining, like moving through quicksand with no solid ground in sight. Feeling stuck and worn down like that takes a real toll\u2014it\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re exhausted and worn thin emotionally. What\u2019s it been like for you on a daily basis managing this heaviness? Have you found anything that helps even a little amidst all this?\nPatient: It feels like a constant battle every single day\u2014waking up to that same restless agitation and dragging exhaustion, and just trying to push through like it\u2019s some endless uphill fight. There\u2019s no real relief, no moment where it lets up enough for me to catch my breath. I\u2019ve tried different ways to cope\u2014music, sketching, sometimes just trying to force rest\u2014but none of it sticks or cuts through the buzz in my head. It just cycles back, over and over. It\u2019s raw and brutal, honestly. I\u2019m worn thin, and this endless loop makes me feel trapped, like I\u2019m stuck in a cage with no way out. It\u2019s beyond draining, and sometimes I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can keep up the fight.\nDoctor: Jamie, what you\u2019re describing\u2014the nonstop struggle without a real break\u2014that\u2019s a heavy, relentless toll to bear. I want to check in on another area: have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately, either eating more or less than usual or any weight shifts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed some changes. It\u2019s not like a huge swing or anything drastic, but my appetite\u2019s been all over the place because of the agitation. Some days I barely feel like eating, and other times I force myself just to keep going. I\u2019ve skipped meals more than I\u2019d like because I\u2019m too restless or distracted. That just makes the tiredness worse and adds to the mess, and honestly, it\u2019s frustrating having to deal with that on top of everything else.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds tough having your appetite swing like that\u2014some days you barely eat, others you\u2019re pushing yourself, which only adds to the exhaustion. Can you tell me how often you find yourself skipping meals or struggling to eat? And have you noticed any weight changes since this started? How do these shifts affect your mood or energy?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I skip meals fairly regularly\u2014at least a few times a week, maybe more when the restlessness hits hard. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m starving all the time, but the agitation and distraction make it hard to sit down and eat like I should. I\u2019ve noticed some mild weight changes\u2014not extreme, but enough that I can feel it\u2014and that just messes with my energy and mood even more. It\u2019s like one more thing piling onto everything else that\u2019s making this whole situation feel impossible to manage sometimes.\nDoctor: Jamie, juggling restlessness, skipping meals, mood shifts, and those subtle weight changes all at once\u2014no wonder this feels overwhelming and like too much to handle. It\u2019s completely natural to feel frustrated and worn down when everything seems to pile up like this. You\u2019re dealing with a lot, and I\u2019m here to work through it with you.\nPatient: It\u2019s honestly crushing\u2014the nonstop restlessness, the appetite crap, the mood swings, it all just builds up into this weight that drags me down every single day. I\u2019m tired in ways I can\u2019t even fully put into words, like this raw exhaustion that leaks into everything I do. It\u2019s infuriating to feel trapped in this loop with no clear way out. But I appreciate that you\u2019re here and willing to listen\u2014it helps more than I can say, even if the struggle doesn\u2019t let up yet.\nDoctor: Jamie, I\u2019m really glad you feel comfortable sharing this with me\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to carry it alone. To help me understand better, have you noticed any changes in how your body moves or feels? Like feeling more restless, pacing, fidgeting, or maybe the opposite\u2014feeling physically or mentally slowed down? Understanding that piece can help us figure out the best ways to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like I\u2019m constantly on edge\u2014I find myself pacing around the room or fidgeting with whatever\u2019s nearby, just trying to get some relief from this tightness in my body. The tension never really lets up; my muscles are always tight, and sitting still feels impossible. Sometimes my mind slows down for a moment, but mostly it\u2019s this restless agitation that dominates, making it hard to feel grounded or calm. It\u2019s exhausting because it\u2019s not just mental\u2014it\u2019s this heavy physical buzz that follows me all day and night, and it makes everything feel harder to manage.\nDoctor: Jamie, that constant physical tension and restlessness sound incredibly draining. How are these feelings impacting your ability to focus, think clearly, or make decisions throughout the day? Is it harder for you to stick with tasks or come to conclusions when your mind is racing like this?\nPatient: It\u2019s brutal. The restless buzz in my body and mind makes it almost impossible to focus or think straight. I\u2019m constantly jumping from one thought to another, and simple tasks suddenly feel like massive obstacles. Making decisions becomes this exhausting, overwhelming process because my brain just won\u2019t settle long enough to weigh things out properly. I get stuck in that cycle of indecisiveness, and it wears me down every single day. It\u2019s not just a little annoyance\u2014this constant agitation is a barrier that keeps me from getting anywhere or feeling grounded.\nDoctor: Jamie, that sounds incredibly tough\u2014the way your mind jumps around and the indecision builds like a wall between you and what you want to do. Can you tell me more about the kinds of decisions or tasks that feel hardest right now? How do you usually try to handle those moments when you feel that stuck, and what goes through your mind when you\u2019re feeling so ungrounded?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nJamie, that sounds incredibly tough\u2014the way your mind jumps around and the indecision builds like a wall between you and what you want to do.

It\u2019s raw and brutal, honestly. I\u2019m worn thin, and this endless loop makes me feel trapped, like I\u2019m stuck in a cage with no way out. It\u2019s beyond draining, and sometimes I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can keep up the fight.\nDoctor: Jamie, what you\u2019re describing\u2014the nonstop struggle without a real break\u2014that\u2019s a heavy, relentless toll to bear. I want to check in on another area: have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately, either eating more or less than usual or any weight shifts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed some changes. It\u2019s not like a huge swing or anything drastic, but my appetite\u2019s been all over the place because of the agitation. Some days I barely feel like eating, and other times I force myself just to keep going. I\u2019ve skipped meals more than I\u2019d like because I\u2019m too restless or distracted. That just makes the tiredness worse and adds to the mess, and honestly, it\u2019s frustrating having to deal with that on top of everything else.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds tough having your appetite swing like that\u2014some days you barely eat, others you\u2019re pushing yourself, which only adds to the exhaustion. Can you tell me how often you find yourself skipping meals or struggling to eat? And have you noticed any weight changes since this started? How do these shifts affect your mood or energy?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I skip meals fairly regularly\u2014at least a few times a week, maybe more when the restlessness hits hard. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m starving all the time, but the agitation and distraction make it hard to sit down and eat like I should. I\u2019ve noticed some mild weight changes\u2014not extreme, but enough that I can feel it\u2014and that just messes with my energy and mood even more. It\u2019s like one more thing piling onto everything else that\u2019s making this whole situation feel impossible to manage sometimes.\nDoctor: Jamie, juggling restlessness, skipping meals, mood shifts, and those subtle weight changes all at once\u2014no wonder this feels overwhelming and like too much to handle. It\u2019s completely natural to feel frustrated and worn down when everything seems to pile up like this. You\u2019re dealing with a lot, and I\u2019m here to work through it with you.\nPatient: It\u2019s honestly crushing\u2014the nonstop restlessness, the appetite crap, the mood swings, it all just builds up into this weight that drags me down every single day. I\u2019m tired in ways I can\u2019t even fully put into words, like this raw exhaustion that leaks into everything I do. It\u2019s infuriating to feel trapped in this loop with no clear way out. But I appreciate that you\u2019re here and willing to listen\u2014it helps more than I can say, even if the struggle doesn\u2019t let up yet.\nDoctor: Jamie, I\u2019m really glad you feel comfortable sharing this with me\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to carry it alone.

Like feeling more restless, pacing, fidgeting, or maybe the opposite\u2014feeling physically or mentally slowed down? Understanding that piece can help us figure out the best ways to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like I\u2019m constantly on edge\u2014I find myself pacing around the room or fidgeting with whatever\u2019s nearby, just trying to get some relief from this tightness in my body. The tension never really lets up; my muscles are always tight, and sitting still feels impossible. Sometimes my mind slows down for a moment, but mostly it\u2019s this restless agitation that dominates, making it hard to feel grounded or calm. It\u2019s exhausting because it\u2019s not just mental\u2014it\u2019s this heavy physical buzz that follows me all day and night, and it makes everything feel harder to manage.\nDoctor: Jamie, that constant physical tension and restlessness sound incredibly draining. How are these feelings impacting your ability to focus, think clearly, or make decisions throughout the day? Is it harder for you to stick with tasks or come to conclusions when your mind is racing like this?\nPatient: It\u2019s brutal. The restless buzz in my body and mind makes it almost impossible to focus or think straight. I\u2019m constantly jumping from one thought to another, and simple tasks suddenly feel like massive obstacles. Making decisions becomes this exhausting, overwhelming process because my brain just won\u2019t settle long enough to weigh things out properly. I get stuck in that cycle of indecisiveness, and it wears me down every single day. It\u2019s not just a little annoyance\u2014this constant agitation is a barrier that keeps me from getting anywhere or feeling grounded.\nDoctor: Jamie, that sounds incredibly tough\u2014the way your mind jumps around and the indecision builds like a wall between you and what you want to do. Can you tell me more about the kinds of decisions or tasks that feel hardest right now? How do you usually try to handle those moments when you feel that stuck, and what goes through your mind when you\u2019re feeling so ungrounded?\nPatient: Even the smallest choices feel impossible\u2014like deciding what to eat or figuring out which task needs to come first turns into this giant, exhausting ordeal. My mind just flips back and forth, overthinking every option and second-guessing until I\u2019m stuck spinning in circles. I try to force myself to act, to push through the mental block, but half the time I just end up paralyzed or switching gears without finishing anything.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days these past couple of weeks. The biggest issue has been my sleep\u2014I can\u2019t seem to just switch off, and I\u2019m constantly restless, like my mind and body won\u2019t settle. It\u2019s exhausting and makes it really hard to concentrate on anything. Everything feels scattered and tense, and it just keeps piling up.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds really tough to be that restless night after night. How often do you find yourself unable to settle like this? What does a usual night of sleep look like for you these days? And those racing thoughts\u2014anything specific that tends to keep your mind buzzing? Also, how is this difficulty concentrating playing out during your day-to-day? Is it interfering with your work, or other parts of your routine?\nPatient: It\u2019s almost every single night\u2014there\u2019s barely been a moment in the past week where I managed to actually just fall asleep and stay asleep without tossing and turning for hours. My mind just keeps racing, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m fixated on any one thing\u2014it\u2019s just this never-ending stream of random worries, fears about what\u2019s next, things I should be doing but haven\u2019t, and it\u2019s all jumbled up and relentless. \n\nThat tired, wired feeling completely wrecks my focus during the day. At work or when I try to sketch or even just do something simple, my attention drifts everywhere. I can\u2019t hold onto an idea long enough to finish what I\u2019m doing, and that frustration just builds on itself. It\u2019s like my brain is stuck in this loop of agitation and distraction that doesn\u2019t give me a break. It\u2019s exhausting and honestly makes everything harder, not just work but daily life in general.\nDoctor: Jamie, with all that restless sleep and mental noise, I imagine your energy feels pretty drained. How have you been feeling during the day in terms of your overall fatigue or energy levels? Do you notice times when you feel completely worn out or unusually low on energy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely wiped out all day\u2014some days my energy bounces around, especially if I had a terrible night\u2019s sleep. But honestly, it\u2019s not that classic \u201cI just want to crash\u201d kind of fatigue. Instead, my body feels tense and wired, like even when I\u2019m tired, I can\u2019t just relax. The agitation keeps me on edge, so it\u2019s more like this restless buzz than real exhaustion. That\u2019s frustrating because it messes with any chance I have to actually feel settled or refreshed.\nDoctor: That restless, wired feeling you\u2019re describing\u2014it sounds really exhausting in its own way, Jamie. Not being able to truly relax even when your body feels tired must make everything feel heavier, like you\u2019re trapped in your own head. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by not getting that sense of calm or refreshment you deserve.\nPatient: Exactly. It\u2019s beyond frustrating\u2014like I\u2019m stuck in this relentless loop where my body screams for rest but my mind refuses to shut down. I\u2019m physically drained, but that wired agitation drags me under even more. It\u2019s this exhausting, heavy weight that spills over into everything I do\u2014work, social stuff, even things I used to enjoy. It feels like no matter how hard I try, there\u2019s no escape from this constant buzzing misery. It\u2019s suffocating and\u2014honestly\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep dealing with it.\nDoctor: Jamie, it\u2019s hard to imagine carrying that kind of weight day in and day out. With all this exhaustion and agitation wearing you down, have you noticed if things or activities you used to enjoy don\u2019t feel the same anymore\u2014like you\u2019ve lost interest or pleasure in them?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in the things I used to care about\u2014not totally. But that constant agitation and exhaustion makes it so damn hard to actually enjoy them. Like, I want to get into my sketching or messing around with music, but most of the time it just feels like I\u2019m pushing through a fog that saps whatever spark those things used to give me. It\u2019s frustrating because the interests are still there, but the tired, wired feeling keeps getting in the way, wearing me down almost every time.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing\u2014wanting to enjoy something but feeling pushed through like it\u2019s blocked\u2014that\u2019s a heavy space to be in, Jamie. With all that in mind, how often have you been feeling low or down, and how long has that feeling been sticking around?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling low pretty much most days for the past several weeks now. It\u2019s not like a sudden crash but more of this constant, dragging weight that just doesn\u2019t let up. That kind of mood wears you down slowly but thoroughly, and it\u2019s hard to shake off. It seeps into everything, making even small tasks feel like a battle, and I\u2019m tired of feeling stuck like this with no real break.\nDoctor: Jamie, carrying that slow, heavy weight day after day must be so draining, like moving through quicksand with no solid ground in sight. Feeling stuck and worn down like that takes a real toll\u2014it\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re exhausted and worn thin emotionally. What\u2019s it been like for you on a daily basis managing this heaviness? Have you found anything that helps even a little amidst all this?\nPatient: It feels like a constant battle every single day\u2014waking up to that same restless agitation and dragging exhaustion, and just trying to push through like it\u2019s some endless uphill fight. There\u2019s no real relief, no moment where it lets up enough for me to catch my breath. I\u2019ve tried different ways to cope\u2014music, sketching, sometimes just trying to force rest\u2014but none of it sticks or cuts through the buzz in my head. It just cycles back, over and over. It\u2019s raw and brutal, honestly. I\u2019m worn thin, and this endless loop makes me feel trapped, like I\u2019m stuck in a cage with no way out. It\u2019s beyond draining, and sometimes I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can keep up the fight.\nDoctor: Jamie, what you\u2019re describing\u2014the nonstop struggle without a real break\u2014that\u2019s a heavy, relentless toll to bear.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days these past couple of weeks. The biggest issue has been my sleep\u2014I can\u2019t seem to just switch off, and I\u2019m constantly restless, like my mind and body won\u2019t settle. It\u2019s exhausting and makes it really hard to concentrate on anything. Everything feels scattered and tense, and it just keeps piling up.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds really tough to be that restless night after night. How often do you find yourself unable to settle like this? What does a usual night of sleep look like for you these days? And those racing thoughts\u2014anything specific that tends to keep your mind buzzing? Also, how is this difficulty concentrating playing out during your day-to-day? Is it interfering with your work, or other parts of your routine?\nPatient: It\u2019s almost every single night\u2014there\u2019s barely been a moment in the past week where I managed to actually just fall asleep and stay asleep without tossing and turning for hours. My mind just keeps racing, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m fixated on any one thing\u2014it\u2019s just this never-ending stream of random worries, fears about what\u2019s next, things I should be doing but haven\u2019t, and it\u2019s all jumbled up and relentless. \n\nThat tired, wired feeling completely wrecks my focus during the day. At work or when I try to sketch or even just do something simple, my attention drifts everywhere. I can\u2019t hold onto an idea long enough to finish what I\u2019m doing, and that frustration just builds on itself. It\u2019s like my brain is stuck in this loop of agitation and distraction that doesn\u2019t give me a break. It\u2019s exhausting and honestly makes everything harder, not just work but daily life in general.\nDoctor: Jamie, with all that restless sleep and mental noise, I imagine your energy feels pretty drained. How have you been feeling during the day in terms of your overall fatigue or energy levels? Do you notice times when you feel completely worn out or unusually low on energy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely wiped out all day\u2014some days my energy bounces around, especially if I had a terrible night\u2019s sleep. But honestly, it\u2019s not that classic \u201cI just want to crash\u201d kind of fatigue. Instead, my body feels tense and wired, like even when I\u2019m tired, I can\u2019t just relax. The agitation keeps me on edge, so it\u2019s more like this restless buzz than real exhaustion. That\u2019s frustrating because it messes with any chance I have to actually feel settled or refreshed.\nDoctor: That restless, wired feeling you\u2019re describing\u2014it sounds really exhausting in its own way, Jamie. Not being able to truly relax even when your body feels tired must make everything feel heavier, like you\u2019re trapped in your own head. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by not getting that sense of calm or refreshment you deserve.\nPatient: Exactly. It\u2019s beyond frustrating\u2014like I\u2019m stuck in this relentless loop where my body screams for rest but my mind refuses to shut down. I\u2019m physically drained, but that wired agitation drags me under even more. It\u2019s this exhausting, heavy weight that spills over into everything I do\u2014work, social stuff, even things I used to enjoy. It feels like no matter how hard I try, there\u2019s no escape from this constant buzzing misery. It\u2019s suffocating and\u2014honestly\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep dealing with it.\nDoctor: Jamie, it\u2019s hard to imagine carrying that kind of weight day in and day out. With all this exhaustion and agitation wearing you down, have you noticed if things or activities you used to enjoy don\u2019t feel the same anymore\u2014like you\u2019ve lost interest or pleasure in them?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in the things I used to care about\u2014not totally. But that constant agitation and exhaustion makes it so damn hard to actually enjoy them. Like, I want to get into my sketching or messing around with music, but most of the time it just feels like I\u2019m pushing through a fog that saps whatever spark those things used to give me. It\u2019s frustrating because the interests are still there, but the tired, wired feeling keeps getting in the way, wearing me down almost every time.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing\u2014wanting to enjoy something but feeling pushed through like it\u2019s blocked\u2014that\u2019s a heavy space to be in, Jamie. With all that in mind, how often have you been feeling low or down, and how long has that feeling been sticking around?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling low pretty much most days for the past several weeks now. It\u2019s not like a sudden crash but more of this constant, dragging weight that just doesn\u2019t let up. That kind of mood wears you down slowly but thoroughly, and it\u2019s hard to shake off. It seeps into everything, making even small tasks feel like a battle, and I\u2019m tired of feeling stuck like this with no real break.\nDoctor: Jamie, carrying that slow, heavy weight day after day must be so draining, like moving through quicksand with no solid ground in sight. Feeling stuck and worn down like that takes a real toll\u2014it\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re exhausted and worn thin emotionally. What\u2019s it been like for you on a daily basis managing this heaviness? Have you found anything that helps even a little amidst all this?\nPatient: It feels like a constant battle every single day\u2014waking up to that same restless agitation and dragging exhaustion, and just trying to push through like it\u2019s some endless uphill fight. There\u2019s no real relief, no moment where it lets up enough for me to catch my breath. I\u2019ve tried different ways to cope\u2014music, sketching, sometimes just trying to force rest\u2014but none of it sticks or cuts through the buzz in my head. It just cycles back, over and over. It\u2019s raw and brutal, honestly. I\u2019m worn thin, and this endless loop makes me feel trapped, like I\u2019m stuck in a cage with no way out. It\u2019s beyond draining, and sometimes I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can keep up the fight.\nDoctor: Jamie, what you\u2019re describing\u2014the nonstop struggle without a real break\u2014that\u2019s a heavy, relentless toll to bear. I want to check in on another area: have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately, either eating more or less than usual or any weight shifts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed some changes. It\u2019s not like a huge swing or anything drastic, but my appetite\u2019s been all over the place because of the agitation. Some days I barely feel like eating, and other times I force myself just to keep going. I\u2019ve skipped meals more than I\u2019d like because I\u2019m too restless or distracted. That just makes the tiredness worse and adds to the mess, and honestly, it\u2019s frustrating having to deal with that on top of everything else.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds tough having your appetite swing like that\u2014some days you barely eat, others you\u2019re pushing yourself, which only adds to the exhaustion. Can you tell me how often you find yourself skipping meals or struggling to eat? And have you noticed any weight changes since this started? How do these shifts affect your mood or energy?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I skip meals fairly regularly\u2014at least a few times a week, maybe more when the restlessness hits hard. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m starving all the time, but the agitation and distraction make it hard to sit down and eat like I should. I\u2019ve noticed some mild weight changes\u2014not extreme, but enough that I can feel it\u2014and that just messes with my energy and mood even more. It\u2019s like one more thing piling onto everything else that\u2019s making this whole situation feel impossible to manage sometimes.\nDoctor: Jamie, juggling restlessness, skipping meals, mood shifts, and those subtle weight changes all at once\u2014no wonder this feels overwhelming and like too much to handle. It\u2019s completely natural to feel frustrated and worn down when everything seems to pile up like this. You\u2019re dealing with a lot, and I\u2019m here to work through it with you.\nPatient: It\u2019s honestly crushing\u2014the nonstop restlessness, the appetite crap, the mood swings, it all just builds up into this weight that drags me down every single day. I\u2019m tired in ways I can\u2019t even fully put into words, like this raw exhaustion that leaks into everything I do. It\u2019s infuriating to feel trapped in this loop with no clear way out. But I appreciate that you\u2019re here and willing to listen\u2014it helps more than I can say, even if the struggle doesn\u2019t let up yet.\nDoctor: Jamie, I\u2019m really glad you feel comfortable sharing this with me\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to carry it alone. To help me understand better, have you noticed any changes in how your body moves or feels? Like feeling more restless, pacing, fidgeting, or maybe the opposite\u2014feeling physically or mentally slowed down? Understanding that piece can help us figure out the best ways to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like I\u2019m constantly on edge\u2014I find myself pacing around the room or fidgeting with whatever\u2019s nearby, just trying to get some relief from this tightness in my body. The tension never really lets up; my muscles are always tight, and sitting still feels impossible. Sometimes my mind slows down for a moment, but mostly it\u2019s this restless agitation that dominates, making it hard to feel grounded or calm. It\u2019s exhausting because it\u2019s not just mental\u2014it\u2019s this heavy physical buzz that follows me all day and night, and it makes everything feel harder to manage.\nDoctor: Jamie, that constant physical tension and restlessness sound incredibly draining. How are these feelings impacting your ability to focus, think clearly, or make decisions throughout the day? Is it harder for you to stick with tasks or come to conclusions when your mind is racing like this?\nPatient: It\u2019s brutal. The restless buzz in my body and mind makes it almost impossible to focus or think straight. I\u2019m constantly jumping from one thought to another, and simple tasks suddenly feel like massive obstacles. Making decisions becomes this exhausting, overwhelming process because my brain just won\u2019t settle long enough to weigh things out properly. I get stuck in that cycle of indecisiveness, and it wears me down every single day. It\u2019s not just a little annoyance\u2014this constant agitation is a barrier that keeps me from getting anywhere or feeling grounded.\nDoctor: Jamie, that sounds incredibly tough\u2014the way your mind jumps around and the indecision builds like a wall between you and what you want to do. Can you tell me more about the kinds of decisions or tasks that feel hardest right now? How do you usually try to handle those moments when you feel that stuck, and what goes through your mind when you\u2019re feeling so ungrounded?\nPatient: Even the smallest choices feel impossible\u2014like deciding what to eat or figuring out which task needs to come first turns into this giant, exhausting ordeal. My mind just flips back and forth, overthinking every option and second-guessing until I\u2019m stuck spinning in circles. I try to force myself to act, to push through the mental block, but half the time I just end up paralyzed or switching gears without finishing anything. It drains me completely because the frustration piles up with the agitation, and it\u2019s like this nonstop loop of mental exhaustion that won\u2019t quit.\nDoctor: Jamie, thank you for being so open about how hard this all is\u2014those daily battles with even simple choices sound incredibly draining. I want to ask something important because I care about your safety and well-being: Have you been having any thoughts about death or suicide lately? Understanding this helps me support you in the best way possible.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days these past couple of weeks. The biggest issue has been my sleep\u2014I can\u2019t seem to just switch off, and I\u2019m constantly restless, like my mind and body won\u2019t settle. It\u2019s exhausting and makes it really hard to concentrate on anything. Everything feels scattered and tense, and it just keeps piling up.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds really tough to be that restless night after night. How often do you find yourself unable to settle like this? What does a usual night of sleep look like for you these days? And those racing thoughts\u2014anything specific that tends to keep your mind buzzing? Also, how is this difficulty concentrating playing out during your day-to-day? Is it interfering with your work, or other parts of your routine?\nPatient: It\u2019s almost every single night\u2014there\u2019s barely been a moment in the past week where I managed to actually just fall asleep and stay asleep without tossing and turning for hours. My mind just keeps racing, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m fixated on any one thing\u2014it\u2019s just this never-ending stream of random worries, fears about what\u2019s next, things I should be doing but haven\u2019t, and it\u2019s all jumbled up and relentless. \n\nThat tired, wired feeling completely wrecks my focus during the day. At work or when I try to sketch or even just do something simple, my attention drifts everywhere. I can\u2019t hold onto an idea long enough to finish what I\u2019m doing, and that frustration just builds on itself. It\u2019s like my brain is stuck in this loop of agitation and distraction that doesn\u2019t give me a break. It\u2019s exhausting and honestly makes everything harder, not just work but daily life in general.\nDoctor: Jamie, with all that restless sleep and mental noise, I imagine your energy feels pretty drained. How have you been feeling during the day in terms of your overall fatigue or energy levels? Do you notice times when you feel completely worn out or unusually low on energy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely wiped out all day\u2014some days my energy bounces around, especially if I had a terrible night\u2019s sleep. But honestly, it\u2019s not that classic \u201cI just want to crash\u201d kind of fatigue. Instead, my body feels tense and wired, like even when I\u2019m tired, I can\u2019t just relax. The agitation keeps me on edge, so it\u2019s more like this restless buzz than real exhaustion. That\u2019s frustrating because it messes with any chance I have to actually feel settled or refreshed.\nDoctor: That restless, wired feeling you\u2019re describing\u2014it sounds really exhausting in its own way, Jamie. Not being able to truly relax even when your body feels tired must make everything feel heavier, like you\u2019re trapped in your own head. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by not getting that sense of calm or refreshment you deserve.\nPatient: Exactly. It\u2019s beyond frustrating\u2014like I\u2019m stuck in this relentless loop where my body screams for rest but my mind refuses to shut down. I\u2019m physically drained, but that wired agitation drags me under even more. It\u2019s this exhausting, heavy weight that spills over into everything I do\u2014work, social stuff, even things I used to enjoy. It feels like no matter how hard I try, there\u2019s no escape from this constant buzzing misery. It\u2019s suffocating and\u2014honestly\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep dealing with it.\nDoctor: Jamie, it\u2019s hard to imagine carrying that kind of weight day in and day out. With all this exhaustion and agitation wearing you down, have you noticed if things or activities you used to enjoy don\u2019t feel the same anymore\u2014like you\u2019ve lost interest or pleasure in them?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in the things I used to care about\u2014not totally. But that constant agitation and exhaustion makes it so damn hard to actually enjoy them. Like, I want to get into my sketching or messing around with music, but most of the time it just feels like I\u2019m pushing through a fog that saps whatever spark those things used to give me. It\u2019s frustrating because the interests are still there, but the tired, wired feeling keeps getting in the way, wearing me down almost every time.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing\u2014wanting to enjoy something but feeling pushed through like it\u2019s blocked\u2014that\u2019s a heavy space to be in, Jamie. With all that in mind, how often have you been feeling low or down, and how long has that feeling been sticking around?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling low pretty much most days for the past several weeks now. It\u2019s not like a sudden crash but more of this constant, dragging weight that just doesn\u2019t let up. That kind of mood wears you down slowly but thoroughly, and it\u2019s hard to shake off. It seeps into everything, making even small tasks feel like a battle, and I\u2019m tired of feeling stuck like this with no real break.\nDoctor: Jamie, carrying that slow, heavy weight day after day must be so draining, like moving through quicksand with no solid ground in sight. Feeling stuck and worn down like that takes a real toll\u2014it\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re exhausted and worn thin emotionally. What\u2019s it been like for you on a daily basis managing this heaviness? Have you found anything that helps even a little amidst all this?\nPatient: It feels like a constant battle every single day\u2014waking up to that same restless agitation and dragging exhaustion, and just trying to push through like it\u2019s some endless uphill fight. There\u2019s no real relief, no moment where it lets up enough for me to catch my breath. I\u2019ve tried different ways to cope\u2014music, sketching, sometimes just trying to force rest\u2014but none of it sticks or cuts through the buzz in my head. It just cycles back, over and over. It\u2019s raw and brutal, honestly. I\u2019m worn thin, and this endless loop makes me feel trapped, like I\u2019m stuck in a cage with no way out. It\u2019s beyond draining, and sometimes I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can keep up the fight.\nDoctor: Jamie, what you\u2019re describing\u2014the nonstop struggle without a real break\u2014that\u2019s a heavy, relentless toll to bear. I want to check in on another area: have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately, either eating more or less than usual or any weight shifts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed some changes. It\u2019s not like a huge swing or anything drastic, but my appetite\u2019s been all over the place because of the agitation. Some days I barely feel like eating, and other times I force myself just to keep going. I\u2019ve skipped meals more than I\u2019d like because I\u2019m too restless or distracted. That just makes the tiredness worse and adds to the mess, and honestly, it\u2019s frustrating having to deal with that on top of everything else.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds tough having your appetite swing like that\u2014some days you barely eat, others you\u2019re pushing yourself, which only adds to the exhaustion. Can you tell me how often you find yourself skipping meals or struggling to eat? And have you noticed any weight changes since this started? How do these shifts affect your mood or energy?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I skip meals fairly regularly\u2014at least a few times a week, maybe more when the restlessness hits hard. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m starving all the time, but the agitation and distraction make it hard to sit down and eat like I should. I\u2019ve noticed some mild weight changes\u2014not extreme, but enough that I can feel it\u2014and that just messes with my energy and mood even more. It\u2019s like one more thing piling onto everything else that\u2019s making this whole situation feel impossible to manage sometimes.\nDoctor: Jamie, juggling restlessness, skipping meals, mood shifts, and those subtle weight changes all at once\u2014no wonder this feels overwhelming and like too much to handle. It\u2019s completely natural to feel frustrated and worn down when everything seems to pile up like this. You\u2019re dealing with a lot, and I\u2019m here to work through it with you.\nPatient: It\u2019s honestly crushing\u2014the nonstop restlessness, the appetite crap, the mood swings, it all just builds up into this weight that drags me down every single day. I\u2019m tired in ways I can\u2019t even fully put into words, like this raw exhaustion that leaks into everything I do. It\u2019s infuriating to feel trapped in this loop with no clear way out. But I appreciate that you\u2019re here and willing to listen\u2014it helps more than I can say, even if the struggle doesn\u2019t let up yet.\nDoctor: Jamie, I\u2019m really glad you feel comfortable sharing this with me\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to carry it alone. To help me understand better, have you noticed any changes in how your body moves or feels? Like feeling more restless, pacing, fidgeting, or maybe the opposite\u2014feeling physically or mentally slowed down? Understanding that piece can help us figure out the best ways to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like I\u2019m constantly on edge\u2014I find myself pacing around the room or fidgeting with whatever\u2019s nearby, just trying to get some relief from this tightness in my body. The tension never really lets up; my muscles are always tight, and sitting still feels impossible. Sometimes my mind slows down for a moment, but mostly it\u2019s this restless agitation that dominates, making it hard to feel grounded or calm. It\u2019s exhausting because it\u2019s not just mental\u2014it\u2019s this heavy physical buzz that follows me all day and night, and it makes everything feel harder to manage.\nDoctor: Jamie, that constant physical tension and restlessness sound incredibly draining. How are these feelings impacting your ability to focus, think clearly, or make decisions throughout the day? Is it harder for you to stick with tasks or come to conclusions when your mind is racing like this?\nPatient: It\u2019s brutal. The restless buzz in my body and mind makes it almost impossible to focus or think straight. I\u2019m constantly jumping from one thought to another, and simple tasks suddenly feel like massive obstacles. Making decisions becomes this exhausting, overwhelming process because my brain just won\u2019t settle long enough to weigh things out properly. I get stuck in that cycle of indecisiveness, and it wears me down every single day. It\u2019s not just a little annoyance\u2014this constant agitation is a barrier that keeps me from getting anywhere or feeling grounded.\nDoctor: Jamie, that sounds incredibly tough\u2014the way your mind jumps around and the indecision builds like a wall between you and what you want to do. Can you tell me more about the kinds of decisions or tasks that feel hardest right now? How do you usually try to handle those moments when you feel that stuck, and what goes through your mind when you\u2019re feeling so ungrounded?\nPatient: Even the smallest choices feel impossible\u2014like deciding what to eat or figuring out which task needs to come first turns into this giant, exhausting ordeal. My mind just flips back and forth, overthinking every option and second-guessing until I\u2019m stuck spinning in circles. I try to force myself to act, to push through the mental block, but half the time I just end up paralyzed or switching gears without finishing anything. It drains me completely because the frustration piles up with the agitation, and it\u2019s like this nonstop loop of mental exhaustion that won\u2019t quit.\nDoctor: Jamie, thank you for being so open about how hard this all is\u2014those daily battles with even simple choices sound incredibly draining. I want to ask something important because I care about your safety and well-being: Have you been having any thoughts about death or suicide lately? Understanding this helps me support you in the best way possible.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I know it\u2019s an important question, and I appreciate you asking, but despite everything I\u2019m dealing with\u2014the exhaustion, the agitation\u2014that hasn\u2019t crossed my mind. I\u2019m focused on trying to manage things and get through it.\nDoctor: I really appreciate your honesty, Jamie, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re focused on finding ways to manage all this\u2014that\u2019s a strong and important mindset. Since sleep has been such a big issue for you, can you tell me more about what your nights look like\u2014like when you usually go to bed, what keeps you awake, and if there\u2019s anything that helps even a little?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nI really appreciate your honesty, Jamie, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re focused on finding ways to manage all this\u2014that\u2019s a strong and important mindset.

But honestly, it\u2019s not that classic \u201cI just want to crash\u201d kind of fatigue. Instead, my body feels tense and wired, like even when I\u2019m tired, I can\u2019t just relax. The agitation keeps me on edge, so it\u2019s more like this restless buzz than real exhaustion. That\u2019s frustrating because it messes with any chance I have to actually feel settled or refreshed.\nDoctor: That restless, wired feeling you\u2019re describing\u2014it sounds really exhausting in its own way, Jamie. Not being able to truly relax even when your body feels tired must make everything feel heavier, like you\u2019re trapped in your own head. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by not getting that sense of calm or refreshment you deserve.\nPatient: Exactly. It\u2019s beyond frustrating\u2014like I\u2019m stuck in this relentless loop where my body screams for rest but my mind refuses to shut down. I\u2019m physically drained, but that wired agitation drags me under even more. It\u2019s this exhausting, heavy weight that spills over into everything I do\u2014work, social stuff, even things I used to enjoy. It feels like no matter how hard I try, there\u2019s no escape from this constant buzzing misery. It\u2019s suffocating and\u2014honestly\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep dealing with it.\nDoctor: Jamie, it\u2019s hard to imagine carrying that kind of weight day in and day out. With all this exhaustion and agitation wearing you down, have you noticed if things or activities you used to enjoy don\u2019t feel the same anymore\u2014like you\u2019ve lost interest or pleasure in them?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in the things I used to care about\u2014not totally. But that constant agitation and exhaustion makes it so damn hard to actually enjoy them. Like, I want to get into my sketching or messing around with music, but most of the time it just feels like I\u2019m pushing through a fog that saps whatever spark those things used to give me. It\u2019s frustrating because the interests are still there, but the tired, wired feeling keeps getting in the way, wearing me down almost every time.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing\u2014wanting to enjoy something but feeling pushed through like it\u2019s blocked\u2014that\u2019s a heavy space to be in, Jamie. With all that in mind, how often have you been feeling low or down, and how long has that feeling been sticking around?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling low pretty much most days for the past several weeks now. It\u2019s not like a sudden crash but more of this constant, dragging weight that just doesn\u2019t let up. That kind of mood wears you down slowly but thoroughly, and it\u2019s hard to shake off. It seeps into everything, making even small tasks feel like a battle, and I\u2019m tired of feeling stuck like this with no real break.\nDoctor: Jamie, carrying that slow, heavy weight day after day must be so draining, like moving through quicksand with no solid ground in sight. Feeling stuck and worn down like that takes a real toll\u2014it\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re exhausted and worn thin emotionally. What\u2019s it been like for you on a daily basis managing this heaviness? Have you found anything that helps even a little amidst all this?\nPatient: It feels like a constant battle every single day\u2014waking up to that same restless agitation and dragging exhaustion, and just trying to push through like it\u2019s some endless uphill fight. There\u2019s no real relief, no moment where it lets up enough for me to catch my breath. I\u2019ve tried different ways to cope\u2014music, sketching, sometimes just trying to force rest\u2014but none of it sticks or cuts through the buzz in my head. It just cycles back, over and over. It\u2019s raw and brutal, honestly. I\u2019m worn thin, and this endless loop makes me feel trapped, like I\u2019m stuck in a cage with no way out. It\u2019s beyond draining, and sometimes I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can keep up the fight.\nDoctor: Jamie, what you\u2019re describing\u2014the nonstop struggle without a real break\u2014that\u2019s a heavy, relentless toll to bear. I want to check in on another area: have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately, either eating more or less than usual or any weight shifts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed some changes. It\u2019s not like a huge swing or anything drastic, but my appetite\u2019s been all over the place because of the agitation. Some days I barely feel like eating, and other times I force myself just to keep going. I\u2019ve skipped meals more than I\u2019d like because I\u2019m too restless or distracted. That just makes the tiredness worse and adds to the mess, and honestly, it\u2019s frustrating having to deal with that on top of everything else.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds tough having your appetite swing like that\u2014some days you barely eat, others you\u2019re pushing yourself, which only adds to the exhaustion. Can you tell me how often you find yourself skipping meals or struggling to eat? And have you noticed any weight changes since this started? How do these shifts affect your mood or energy?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I skip meals fairly regularly\u2014at least a few times a week, maybe more when the restlessness hits hard. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m starving all the time, but the agitation and distraction make it hard to sit down and eat like I should. I\u2019ve noticed some mild weight changes\u2014not extreme, but enough that I can feel it\u2014and that just messes with my energy and mood even more. It\u2019s like one more thing piling onto everything else that\u2019s making this whole situation feel impossible to manage sometimes.\nDoctor: Jamie, juggling restlessness, skipping meals, mood shifts, and those subtle weight changes all at once\u2014no wonder this feels overwhelming and like too much to handle. It\u2019s completely natural to feel frustrated and worn down when everything seems to pile up like this. You\u2019re dealing with a lot, and I\u2019m here to work through it with you.\nPatient: It\u2019s honestly crushing\u2014the nonstop restlessness, the appetite crap, the mood swings, it all just builds up into this weight that drags me down every single day. I\u2019m tired in ways I can\u2019t even fully put into words, like this raw exhaustion that leaks into everything I do. It\u2019s infuriating to feel trapped in this loop with no clear way out. But I appreciate that you\u2019re here and willing to listen\u2014it helps more than I can say, even if the struggle doesn\u2019t let up yet.\nDoctor: Jamie, I\u2019m really glad you feel comfortable sharing this with me\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to carry it alone. To help me understand better, have you noticed any changes in how your body moves or feels? Like feeling more restless, pacing, fidgeting, or maybe the opposite\u2014feeling physically or mentally slowed down? Understanding that piece can help us figure out the best ways to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like I\u2019m constantly on edge\u2014I find myself pacing around the room or fidgeting with whatever\u2019s nearby, just trying to get some relief from this tightness in my body. The tension never really lets up; my muscles are always tight, and sitting still feels impossible. Sometimes my mind slows down for a moment, but mostly it\u2019s this restless agitation that dominates, making it hard to feel grounded or calm. It\u2019s exhausting because it\u2019s not just mental\u2014it\u2019s this heavy physical buzz that follows me all day and night, and it makes everything feel harder to manage.\nDoctor: Jamie, that constant physical tension and restlessness sound incredibly draining. How are these feelings impacting your ability to focus, think clearly, or make decisions throughout the day? Is it harder for you to stick with tasks or come to conclusions when your mind is racing like this?\nPatient: It\u2019s brutal. The restless buzz in my body and mind makes it almost impossible to focus or think straight. I\u2019m constantly jumping from one thought to another, and simple tasks suddenly feel like massive obstacles. Making decisions becomes this exhausting, overwhelming process because my brain just won\u2019t settle long enough to weigh things out properly. I get stuck in that cycle of indecisiveness, and it wears me down every single day. It\u2019s not just a little annoyance\u2014this constant agitation is a barrier that keeps me from getting anywhere or feeling grounded.\nDoctor: Jamie, that sounds incredibly tough\u2014the way your mind jumps around and the indecision builds like a wall between you and what you want to do. Can you tell me more about the kinds of decisions or tasks that feel hardest right now? How do you usually try to handle those moments when you feel that stuck, and what goes through your mind when you\u2019re feeling so ungrounded?\nPatient: Even the smallest choices feel impossible\u2014like deciding what to eat or figuring out which task needs to come first turns into this giant, exhausting ordeal. My mind just flips back and forth, overthinking every option and second-guessing until I\u2019m stuck spinning in circles. I try to force myself to act, to push through the mental block, but half the time I just end up paralyzed or switching gears without finishing anything. It drains me completely because the frustration piles up with the agitation, and it\u2019s like this nonstop loop of mental exhaustion that won\u2019t quit.\nDoctor: Jamie, thank you for being so open about how hard this all is\u2014those daily battles with even simple choices sound incredibly draining. I want to ask something important because I care about your safety and well-being: Have you been having any thoughts about death or suicide lately? Understanding this helps me support you in the best way possible.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I know it\u2019s an important question, and I appreciate you asking, but despite everything I\u2019m dealing with\u2014the exhaustion, the agitation\u2014that hasn\u2019t crossed my mind. I\u2019m focused on trying to manage things and get through it.\nDoctor: I really appreciate your honesty, Jamie, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re focused on finding ways to manage all this\u2014that\u2019s a strong and important mindset. Since sleep has been such a big issue for you, can you tell me more about what your nights look like\u2014like when you usually go to bed, what keeps you awake, and if there\u2019s anything that helps even a little?\nPatient: I usually try to go to bed around the same time most nights, but that\u2019s where it starts to fall apart. My mind just won\u2019t quiet down, and the agitation in my body keeps me tossing and turning for hours. Nothing really helps\u2014not that I haven\u2019t tried\u2014but it\u2019s mostly the same restless thoughts and tightness that keep me awake until I finally crash, which feels way too late.

The biggest issue has been my sleep\u2014I can\u2019t seem to just switch off, and I\u2019m constantly restless, like my mind and body won\u2019t settle. It\u2019s exhausting and makes it really hard to concentrate on anything. Everything feels scattered and tense, and it just keeps piling up.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds really tough to be that restless night after night. How often do you find yourself unable to settle like this? What does a usual night of sleep look like for you these days? And those racing thoughts\u2014anything specific that tends to keep your mind buzzing? Also, how is this difficulty concentrating playing out during your day-to-day? Is it interfering with your work, or other parts of your routine?\nPatient: It\u2019s almost every single night\u2014there\u2019s barely been a moment in the past week where I managed to actually just fall asleep and stay asleep without tossing and turning for hours. My mind just keeps racing, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m fixated on any one thing\u2014it\u2019s just this never-ending stream of random worries, fears about what\u2019s next, things I should be doing but haven\u2019t, and it\u2019s all jumbled up and relentless. \n\nThat tired, wired feeling completely wrecks my focus during the day. At work or when I try to sketch or even just do something simple, my attention drifts everywhere. I can\u2019t hold onto an idea long enough to finish what I\u2019m doing, and that frustration just builds on itself. It\u2019s like my brain is stuck in this loop of agitation and distraction that doesn\u2019t give me a break. It\u2019s exhausting and honestly makes everything harder, not just work but daily life in general.\nDoctor: Jamie, with all that restless sleep and mental noise, I imagine your energy feels pretty drained. How have you been feeling during the day in terms of your overall fatigue or energy levels? Do you notice times when you feel completely worn out or unusually low on energy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely wiped out all day\u2014some days my energy bounces around, especially if I had a terrible night\u2019s sleep. But honestly, it\u2019s not that classic \u201cI just want to crash\u201d kind of fatigue. Instead, my body feels tense and wired, like even when I\u2019m tired, I can\u2019t just relax.

Not being able to truly relax even when your body feels tired must make everything feel heavier, like you\u2019re trapped in your own head. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by not getting that sense of calm or refreshment you deserve.\nPatient: Exactly. It\u2019s beyond frustrating\u2014like I\u2019m stuck in this relentless loop where my body screams for rest but my mind refuses to shut down. I\u2019m physically drained, but that wired agitation drags me under even more. It\u2019s this exhausting, heavy weight that spills over into everything I do\u2014work, social stuff, even things I used to enjoy. It feels like no matter how hard I try, there\u2019s no escape from this constant buzzing misery. It\u2019s suffocating and\u2014honestly\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep dealing with it.\nDoctor: Jamie, it\u2019s hard to imagine carrying that kind of weight day in and day out.

With all that in mind, how often have you been feeling low or down, and how long has that feeling been sticking around?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling low pretty much most days for the past several weeks now. It\u2019s not like a sudden crash but more of this constant, dragging weight that just doesn\u2019t let up. That kind of mood wears you down slowly but thoroughly, and it\u2019s hard to shake off. It seeps into everything, making even small tasks feel like a battle, and I\u2019m tired of feeling stuck like this with no real break.\nDoctor: Jamie, carrying that slow, heavy weight day after day must be so draining, like moving through quicksand with no solid ground in sight. Feeling stuck and worn down like that takes a real toll\u2014it\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re exhausted and worn thin emotionally.

Can you tell me how often you find yourself skipping meals or struggling to eat? And have you noticed any weight changes since this started? How do these shifts affect your mood or energy?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I skip meals fairly regularly\u2014at least a few times a week, maybe more when the restlessness hits hard. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m starving all the time, but the agitation and distraction make it hard to sit down and eat like I should. I\u2019ve noticed some mild weight changes\u2014not extreme, but enough that I can feel it\u2014and that just messes with my energy and mood even more. It\u2019s like one more thing piling onto everything else that\u2019s making this whole situation feel impossible to manage sometimes.\nDoctor: Jamie, juggling restlessness, skipping meals, mood shifts, and those subtle weight changes all at once\u2014no wonder this feels overwhelming and like too much to handle. It\u2019s completely natural to feel frustrated and worn down when everything seems to pile up like this. You\u2019re dealing with a lot, and I\u2019m here to work through it with you.\nPatient: It\u2019s honestly crushing\u2014the nonstop restlessness, the appetite crap, the mood swings, it all just builds up into this weight that drags me down every single day. I\u2019m tired in ways I can\u2019t even fully put into words, like this raw exhaustion that leaks into everything I do. It\u2019s infuriating to feel trapped in this loop with no clear way out. But I appreciate that you\u2019re here and willing to listen\u2014it helps more than I can say, even if the struggle doesn\u2019t let up yet.\nDoctor: Jamie, I\u2019m really glad you feel comfortable sharing this with me\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to carry it alone. To help me understand better, have you noticed any changes in how your body moves or feels? Like feeling more restless, pacing, fidgeting, or maybe the opposite\u2014feeling physically or mentally slowed down? Understanding that piece can help us figure out the best ways to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like I\u2019m constantly on edge\u2014I find myself pacing around the room or fidgeting with whatever\u2019s nearby, just trying to get some relief from this tightness in my body. The tension never really lets up; my muscles are always tight, and sitting still feels impossible. Sometimes my mind slows down for a moment, but mostly it\u2019s this restless agitation that dominates, making it hard to feel grounded or calm. It\u2019s exhausting because it\u2019s not just mental\u2014it\u2019s this heavy physical buzz that follows me all day and night, and it makes everything feel harder to manage.\nDoctor: Jamie, that constant physical tension and restlessness sound incredibly draining. How are these feelings impacting your ability to focus, think clearly, or make decisions throughout the day? Is it harder for you to stick with tasks or come to conclusions when your mind is racing like this?\nPatient: It\u2019s brutal. The restless buzz in my body and mind makes it almost impossible to focus or think straight. I\u2019m constantly jumping from one thought to another, and simple tasks suddenly feel like massive obstacles. Making decisions becomes this exhausting, overwhelming process because my brain just won\u2019t settle long enough to weigh things out properly. I get stuck in that cycle of indecisiveness, and it wears me down every single day. It\u2019s not just a little annoyance\u2014this constant agitation is a barrier that keeps me from getting anywhere or feeling grounded.\nDoctor: Jamie, that sounds incredibly tough\u2014the way your mind jumps around and the indecision builds like a wall between you and what you want to do. Can you tell me more about the kinds of decisions or tasks that feel hardest right now? How do you usually try to handle those moments when you feel that stuck, and what goes through your mind when you\u2019re feeling so ungrounded?\nPatient: Even the smallest choices feel impossible\u2014like deciding what to eat or figuring out which task needs to come first turns into this giant, exhausting ordeal. My mind just flips back and forth, overthinking every option and second-guessing until I\u2019m stuck spinning in circles. I try to force myself to act, to push through the mental block, but half the time I just end up paralyzed or switching gears without finishing anything. It drains me completely because the frustration piles up with the agitation, and it\u2019s like this nonstop loop of mental exhaustion that won\u2019t quit.\nDoctor: Jamie, thank you for being so open about how hard this all is\u2014those daily battles with even simple choices sound incredibly draining. I want to ask something important because I care about your safety and well-being: Have you been having any thoughts about death or suicide lately? Understanding this helps me support you in the best way possible.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I know it\u2019s an important question, and I appreciate you asking, but despite everything I\u2019m dealing with\u2014the exhaustion, the agitation\u2014that hasn\u2019t crossed my mind. I\u2019m focused on trying to manage things and get through it.\nDoctor: I really appreciate your honesty, Jamie, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re focused on finding ways to manage all this\u2014that\u2019s a strong and important mindset. Since sleep has been such a big issue for you, can you tell me more about what your nights look like\u2014like when you usually go to bed, what keeps you awake, and if there\u2019s anything that helps even a little?\nPatient: I usually try to go to bed around the same time most nights, but that\u2019s where it starts to fall apart. My mind just won\u2019t quiet down, and the agitation in my body keeps me tossing and turning for hours. Nothing really helps\u2014not that I haven\u2019t tried\u2014but it\u2019s mostly the same restless thoughts and tightness that keep me awake until I finally crash, which feels way too late. It\u2019s just how it is at this point, more or less.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds incredibly tough to want rest and peace at night but feel trapped by that relentless restlessness and racing mind instead.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days these past couple of weeks. The biggest issue has been my sleep\u2014I can\u2019t seem to just switch off, and I\u2019m constantly restless, like my mind and body won\u2019t settle. It\u2019s exhausting and makes it really hard to concentrate on anything. Everything feels scattered and tense, and it just keeps piling up.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds really tough to be that restless night after night. How often do you find yourself unable to settle like this? What does a usual night of sleep look like for you these days? And those racing thoughts\u2014anything specific that tends to keep your mind buzzing? Also, how is this difficulty concentrating playing out during your day-to-day? Is it interfering with your work, or other parts of your routine?\nPatient: It\u2019s almost every single night\u2014there\u2019s barely been a moment in the past week where I managed to actually just fall asleep and stay asleep without tossing and turning for hours. My mind just keeps racing, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m fixated on any one thing\u2014it\u2019s just this never-ending stream of random worries, fears about what\u2019s next, things I should be doing but haven\u2019t, and it\u2019s all jumbled up and relentless. \n\nThat tired, wired feeling completely wrecks my focus during the day. At work or when I try to sketch or even just do something simple, my attention drifts everywhere. I can\u2019t hold onto an idea long enough to finish what I\u2019m doing, and that frustration just builds on itself. It\u2019s like my brain is stuck in this loop of agitation and distraction that doesn\u2019t give me a break. It\u2019s exhausting and honestly makes everything harder, not just work but daily life in general.\nDoctor: Jamie, with all that restless sleep and mental noise, I imagine your energy feels pretty drained. How have you been feeling during the day in terms of your overall fatigue or energy levels? Do you notice times when you feel completely worn out or unusually low on energy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely wiped out all day\u2014some days my energy bounces around, especially if I had a terrible night\u2019s sleep. But honestly, it\u2019s not that classic \u201cI just want to crash\u201d kind of fatigue. Instead, my body feels tense and wired, like even when I\u2019m tired, I can\u2019t just relax. The agitation keeps me on edge, so it\u2019s more like this restless buzz than real exhaustion. That\u2019s frustrating because it messes with any chance I have to actually feel settled or refreshed.\nDoctor: That restless, wired feeling you\u2019re describing\u2014it sounds really exhausting in its own way, Jamie. Not being able to truly relax even when your body feels tired must make everything feel heavier, like you\u2019re trapped in your own head. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by not getting that sense of calm or refreshment you deserve.\nPatient: Exactly. It\u2019s beyond frustrating\u2014like I\u2019m stuck in this relentless loop where my body screams for rest but my mind refuses to shut down. I\u2019m physically drained, but that wired agitation drags me under even more. It\u2019s this exhausting, heavy weight that spills over into everything I do\u2014work, social stuff, even things I used to enjoy. It feels like no matter how hard I try, there\u2019s no escape from this constant buzzing misery. It\u2019s suffocating and\u2014honestly\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep dealing with it.\nDoctor: Jamie, it\u2019s hard to imagine carrying that kind of weight day in and day out. With all this exhaustion and agitation wearing you down, have you noticed if things or activities you used to enjoy don\u2019t feel the same anymore\u2014like you\u2019ve lost interest or pleasure in them?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in the things I used to care about\u2014not totally. But that constant agitation and exhaustion makes it so damn hard to actually enjoy them. Like, I want to get into my sketching or messing around with music, but most of the time it just feels like I\u2019m pushing through a fog that saps whatever spark those things used to give me. It\u2019s frustrating because the interests are still there, but the tired, wired feeling keeps getting in the way, wearing me down almost every time.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing\u2014wanting to enjoy something but feeling pushed through like it\u2019s blocked\u2014that\u2019s a heavy space to be in, Jamie. With all that in mind, how often have you been feeling low or down, and how long has that feeling been sticking around?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling low pretty much most days for the past several weeks now. It\u2019s not like a sudden crash but more of this constant, dragging weight that just doesn\u2019t let up. That kind of mood wears you down slowly but thoroughly, and it\u2019s hard to shake off. It seeps into everything, making even small tasks feel like a battle, and I\u2019m tired of feeling stuck like this with no real break.\nDoctor: Jamie, carrying that slow, heavy weight day after day must be so draining, like moving through quicksand with no solid ground in sight. Feeling stuck and worn down like that takes a real toll\u2014it\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re exhausted and worn thin emotionally. What\u2019s it been like for you on a daily basis managing this heaviness? Have you found anything that helps even a little amidst all this?\nPatient: It feels like a constant battle every single day\u2014waking up to that same restless agitation and dragging exhaustion, and just trying to push through like it\u2019s some endless uphill fight. There\u2019s no real relief, no moment where it lets up enough for me to catch my breath. I\u2019ve tried different ways to cope\u2014music, sketching, sometimes just trying to force rest\u2014but none of it sticks or cuts through the buzz in my head. It just cycles back, over and over. It\u2019s raw and brutal, honestly. I\u2019m worn thin, and this endless loop makes me feel trapped, like I\u2019m stuck in a cage with no way out. It\u2019s beyond draining, and sometimes I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can keep up the fight.\nDoctor: Jamie, what you\u2019re describing\u2014the nonstop struggle without a real break\u2014that\u2019s a heavy, relentless toll to bear. I want to check in on another area: have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately, either eating more or less than usual or any weight shifts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed some changes. It\u2019s not like a huge swing or anything drastic, but my appetite\u2019s been all over the place because of the agitation. Some days I barely feel like eating, and other times I force myself just to keep going. I\u2019ve skipped meals more than I\u2019d like because I\u2019m too restless or distracted. That just makes the tiredness worse and adds to the mess, and honestly, it\u2019s frustrating having to deal with that on top of everything else.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds tough having your appetite swing like that\u2014some days you barely eat, others you\u2019re pushing yourself, which only adds to the exhaustion. Can you tell me how often you find yourself skipping meals or struggling to eat? And have you noticed any weight changes since this started? How do these shifts affect your mood or energy?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I skip meals fairly regularly\u2014at least a few times a week, maybe more when the restlessness hits hard. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m starving all the time, but the agitation and distraction make it hard to sit down and eat like I should. I\u2019ve noticed some mild weight changes\u2014not extreme, but enough that I can feel it\u2014and that just messes with my energy and mood even more. It\u2019s like one more thing piling onto everything else that\u2019s making this whole situation feel impossible to manage sometimes.\nDoctor: Jamie, juggling restlessness, skipping meals, mood shifts, and those subtle weight changes all at once\u2014no wonder this feels overwhelming and like too much to handle.

Understanding that piece can help us figure out the best ways to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like I\u2019m constantly on edge\u2014I find myself pacing around the room or fidgeting with whatever\u2019s nearby, just trying to get some relief from this tightness in my body. The tension never really lets up; my muscles are always tight, and sitting still feels impossible. Sometimes my mind slows down for a moment, but mostly it\u2019s this restless agitation that dominates, making it hard to feel grounded or calm. It\u2019s exhausting because it\u2019s not just mental\u2014it\u2019s this heavy physical buzz that follows me all day and night, and it makes everything feel harder to manage.\nDoctor: Jamie, that constant physical tension and restlessness sound incredibly draining.

Making decisions becomes this exhausting, overwhelming process because my brain just won\u2019t settle long enough to weigh things out properly.

Can you tell me more about the kinds of decisions or tasks that feel hardest right now? How do you usually try to handle those moments when you feel that stuck, and what goes through your mind when you\u2019re feeling so ungrounded?\nPatient: Even the smallest choices feel impossible\u2014like deciding what to eat or figuring out which task needs to come first turns into this giant, exhausting ordeal. My mind just flips back and forth, overthinking every option and second-guessing until I\u2019m stuck spinning in circles. I try to force myself to act, to push through the mental block, but half the time I just end up paralyzed or switching gears without finishing anything. It drains me completely because the frustration piles up with the agitation, and it\u2019s like this nonstop loop of mental exhaustion that won\u2019t quit.\nDoctor: Jamie, thank you for being so open about how hard this all is\u2014those daily battles with even simple choices sound incredibly draining.

Since sleep has been such a big issue for you, can you tell me more about what your nights look like\u2014like when you usually go to bed, what keeps you awake, and if there\u2019s anything that helps even a little?\nPatient: I usually try to go to bed around the same time most nights, but that\u2019s where it starts to fall apart.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days these past couple of weeks. The biggest issue has been my sleep\u2014I can\u2019t seem to just switch off, and I\u2019m constantly restless, like my mind and body won\u2019t settle. It\u2019s exhausting and makes it really hard to concentrate on anything. Everything feels scattered and tense, and it just keeps piling up.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds really tough to be that restless night after night. How often do you find yourself unable to settle like this? What does a usual night of sleep look like for you these days? And those racing thoughts\u2014anything specific that tends to keep your mind buzzing? Also, how is this difficulty concentrating playing out during your day-to-day? Is it interfering with your work, or other parts of your routine?\nPatient: It\u2019s almost every single night\u2014there\u2019s barely been a moment in the past week where I managed to actually just fall asleep and stay asleep without tossing and turning for hours. My mind just keeps racing, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m fixated on any one thing\u2014it\u2019s just this never-ending stream of random worries, fears about what\u2019s next, things I should be doing but haven\u2019t, and it\u2019s all jumbled up and relentless. \n\nThat tired, wired feeling completely wrecks my focus during the day. At work or when I try to sketch or even just do something simple, my attention drifts everywhere. I can\u2019t hold onto an idea long enough to finish what I\u2019m doing, and that frustration just builds on itself. It\u2019s like my brain is stuck in this loop of agitation and distraction that doesn\u2019t give me a break. It\u2019s exhausting and honestly makes everything harder, not just work but daily life in general.\nDoctor: Jamie, with all that restless sleep and mental noise, I imagine your energy feels pretty drained. How have you been feeling during the day in terms of your overall fatigue or energy levels? Do you notice times when you feel completely worn out or unusually low on energy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely wiped out all day\u2014some days my energy bounces around, especially if I had a terrible night\u2019s sleep. But honestly, it\u2019s not that classic \u201cI just want to crash\u201d kind of fatigue. Instead, my body feels tense and wired, like even when I\u2019m tired, I can\u2019t just relax. The agitation keeps me on edge, so it\u2019s more like this restless buzz than real exhaustion. That\u2019s frustrating because it messes with any chance I have to actually feel settled or refreshed.\nDoctor: That restless, wired feeling you\u2019re describing\u2014it sounds really exhausting in its own way, Jamie. Not being able to truly relax even when your body feels tired must make everything feel heavier, like you\u2019re trapped in your own head. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by not getting that sense of calm or refreshment you deserve.\nPatient: Exactly. It\u2019s beyond frustrating\u2014like I\u2019m stuck in this relentless loop where my body screams for rest but my mind refuses to shut down. I\u2019m physically drained, but that wired agitation drags me under even more. It\u2019s this exhausting, heavy weight that spills over into everything I do\u2014work, social stuff, even things I used to enjoy. It feels like no matter how hard I try, there\u2019s no escape from this constant buzzing misery. It\u2019s suffocating and\u2014honestly\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep dealing with it.\nDoctor: Jamie, it\u2019s hard to imagine carrying that kind of weight day in and day out. With all this exhaustion and agitation wearing you down, have you noticed if things or activities you used to enjoy don\u2019t feel the same anymore\u2014like you\u2019ve lost interest or pleasure in them?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in the things I used to care about\u2014not totally. But that constant agitation and exhaustion makes it so damn hard to actually enjoy them. Like, I want to get into my sketching or messing around with music, but most of the time it just feels like I\u2019m pushing through a fog that saps whatever spark those things used to give me. It\u2019s frustrating because the interests are still there, but the tired, wired feeling keeps getting in the way, wearing me down almost every time.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing\u2014wanting to enjoy something but feeling pushed through like it\u2019s blocked\u2014that\u2019s a heavy space to be in, Jamie. With all that in mind, how often have you been feeling low or down, and how long has that feeling been sticking around?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling low pretty much most days for the past several weeks now. It\u2019s not like a sudden crash but more of this constant, dragging weight that just doesn\u2019t let up. That kind of mood wears you down slowly but thoroughly, and it\u2019s hard to shake off. It seeps into everything, making even small tasks feel like a battle, and I\u2019m tired of feeling stuck like this with no real break.\nDoctor: Jamie, carrying that slow, heavy weight day after day must be so draining, like moving through quicksand with no solid ground in sight. Feeling stuck and worn down like that takes a real toll\u2014it\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re exhausted and worn thin emotionally. What\u2019s it been like for you on a daily basis managing this heaviness? Have you found anything that helps even a little amidst all this?\nPatient: It feels like a constant battle every single day\u2014waking up to that same restless agitation and dragging exhaustion, and just trying to push through like it\u2019s some endless uphill fight. There\u2019s no real relief, no moment where it lets up enough for me to catch my breath. I\u2019ve tried different ways to cope\u2014music, sketching, sometimes just trying to force rest\u2014but none of it sticks or cuts through the buzz in my head. It just cycles back, over and over. It\u2019s raw and brutal, honestly. I\u2019m worn thin, and this endless loop makes me feel trapped, like I\u2019m stuck in a cage with no way out. It\u2019s beyond draining, and sometimes I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can keep up the fight.\nDoctor: Jamie, what you\u2019re describing\u2014the nonstop struggle without a real break\u2014that\u2019s a heavy, relentless toll to bear. I want to check in on another area: have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately, either eating more or less than usual or any weight shifts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed some changes. It\u2019s not like a huge swing or anything drastic, but my appetite\u2019s been all over the place because of the agitation. Some days I barely feel like eating, and other times I force myself just to keep going. I\u2019ve skipped meals more than I\u2019d like because I\u2019m too restless or distracted. That just makes the tiredness worse and adds to the mess, and honestly, it\u2019s frustrating having to deal with that on top of everything else.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds tough having your appetite swing like that\u2014some days you barely eat, others you\u2019re pushing yourself, which only adds to the exhaustion. Can you tell me how often you find yourself skipping meals or struggling to eat? And have you noticed any weight changes since this started? How do these shifts affect your mood or energy?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I skip meals fairly regularly\u2014at least a few times a week, maybe more when the restlessness hits hard. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m starving all the time, but the agitation and distraction make it hard to sit down and eat like I should. I\u2019ve noticed some mild weight changes\u2014not extreme, but enough that I can feel it\u2014and that just messes with my energy and mood even more. It\u2019s like one more thing piling onto everything else that\u2019s making this whole situation feel impossible to manage sometimes.\nDoctor: Jamie, juggling restlessness, skipping meals, mood shifts, and those subtle weight changes all at once\u2014no wonder this feels overwhelming and like too much to handle. It\u2019s completely natural to feel frustrated and worn down when everything seems to pile up like this. You\u2019re dealing with a lot, and I\u2019m here to work through it with you.\nPatient: It\u2019s honestly crushing\u2014the nonstop restlessness, the appetite crap, the mood swings, it all just builds up into this weight that drags me down every single day. I\u2019m tired in ways I can\u2019t even fully put into words, like this raw exhaustion that leaks into everything I do. It\u2019s infuriating to feel trapped in this loop with no clear way out. But I appreciate that you\u2019re here and willing to listen\u2014it helps more than I can say, even if the struggle doesn\u2019t let up yet.\nDoctor: Jamie, I\u2019m really glad you feel comfortable sharing this with me\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to carry it alone. To help me understand better, have you noticed any changes in how your body moves or feels? Like feeling more restless, pacing, fidgeting, or maybe the opposite\u2014feeling physically or mentally slowed down? Understanding that piece can help us figure out the best ways to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like I\u2019m constantly on edge\u2014I find myself pacing around the room or fidgeting with whatever\u2019s nearby, just trying to get some relief from this tightness in my body. The tension never really lets up; my muscles are always tight, and sitting still feels impossible. Sometimes my mind slows down for a moment, but mostly it\u2019s this restless agitation that dominates, making it hard to feel grounded or calm. It\u2019s exhausting because it\u2019s not just mental\u2014it\u2019s this heavy physical buzz that follows me all day and night, and it makes everything feel harder to manage.\nDoctor: Jamie, that constant physical tension and restlessness sound incredibly draining. How are these feelings impacting your ability to focus, think clearly, or make decisions throughout the day? Is it harder for you to stick with tasks or come to conclusions when your mind is racing like this?\nPatient: It\u2019s brutal. The restless buzz in my body and mind makes it almost impossible to focus or think straight. I\u2019m constantly jumping from one thought to another, and simple tasks suddenly feel like massive obstacles. Making decisions becomes this exhausting, overwhelming process because my brain just won\u2019t settle long enough to weigh things out properly. I get stuck in that cycle of indecisiveness, and it wears me down every single day. It\u2019s not just a little annoyance\u2014this constant agitation is a barrier that keeps me from getting anywhere or feeling grounded.\nDoctor: Jamie, that sounds incredibly tough\u2014the way your mind jumps around and the indecision builds like a wall between you and what you want to do. Can you tell me more about the kinds of decisions or tasks that feel hardest right now? How do you usually try to handle those moments when you feel that stuck, and what goes through your mind when you\u2019re feeling so ungrounded?\nPatient: Even the smallest choices feel impossible\u2014like deciding what to eat or figuring out which task needs to come first turns into this giant, exhausting ordeal. My mind just flips back and forth, overthinking every option and second-guessing until I\u2019m stuck spinning in circles. I try to force myself to act, to push through the mental block, but half the time I just end up paralyzed or switching gears without finishing anything. It drains me completely because the frustration piles up with the agitation, and it\u2019s like this nonstop loop of mental exhaustion that won\u2019t quit.\nDoctor: Jamie, thank you for being so open about how hard this all is\u2014those daily battles with even simple choices sound incredibly draining. I want to ask something important because I care about your safety and well-being: Have you been having any thoughts about death or suicide lately? Understanding this helps me support you in the best way possible.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I know it\u2019s an important question, and I appreciate you asking, but despite everything I\u2019m dealing with\u2014the exhaustion, the agitation\u2014that hasn\u2019t crossed my mind. I\u2019m focused on trying to manage things and get through it.\nDoctor: I really appreciate your honesty, Jamie, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re focused on finding ways to manage all this\u2014that\u2019s a strong and important mindset. Since sleep has been such a big issue for you, can you tell me more about what your nights look like\u2014like when you usually go to bed, what keeps you awake, and if there\u2019s anything that helps even a little?\nPatient: I usually try to go to bed around the same time most nights, but that\u2019s where it starts to fall apart. My mind just won\u2019t quiet down, and the agitation in my body keeps me tossing and turning for hours. Nothing really helps\u2014not that I haven\u2019t tried\u2014but it\u2019s mostly the same restless thoughts and tightness that keep me awake until I finally crash, which feels way too late. It\u2019s just how it is at this point, more or less.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds incredibly tough to want rest and peace at night but feel trapped by that relentless restlessness and racing mind instead. I want you to know that what you\u2019re going through is real and valid, and I\u2019m here to help you find a way through this\u2014not alone, but together. We\u2019ll work on getting you some relief and more restful nights.\nPatient: Thanks, I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard dealing with all this, but knowing someone\u2019s actually willing to help means a lot. I\u2019m hopeful we can figure something out that makes a difference, even if it\u2019s just small steps at a time.\nDoctor: Jamie, it takes a lot of strength to keep showing up and facing this day after day, especially when it feels so heavy. That hope you have is important\u2014it\u2019s the spark we\u2019ll hold onto as we take those small, meaningful steps forward together.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Honestly, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down most days these past couple of weeks. The biggest issue has been my sleep\u2014I can\u2019t seem to just switch off, and I\u2019m constantly restless, like my mind and body won\u2019t settle. It\u2019s exhausting and makes it really hard to concentrate on anything. Everything feels scattered and tense, and it just keeps piling up.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds really tough to be that restless night after night. How often do you find yourself unable to settle like this? What does a usual night of sleep look like for you these days? And those racing thoughts\u2014anything specific that tends to keep your mind buzzing? Also, how is this difficulty concentrating playing out during your day-to-day? Is it interfering with your work, or other parts of your routine?\nPatient: It\u2019s almost every single night\u2014there\u2019s barely been a moment in the past week where I managed to actually just fall asleep and stay asleep without tossing and turning for hours. My mind just keeps racing, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m fixated on any one thing\u2014it\u2019s just this never-ending stream of random worries, fears about what\u2019s next, things I should be doing but haven\u2019t, and it\u2019s all jumbled up and relentless. \n\nThat tired, wired feeling completely wrecks my focus during the day. At work or when I try to sketch or even just do something simple, my attention drifts everywhere. I can\u2019t hold onto an idea long enough to finish what I\u2019m doing, and that frustration just builds on itself. It\u2019s like my brain is stuck in this loop of agitation and distraction that doesn\u2019t give me a break. It\u2019s exhausting and honestly makes everything harder, not just work but daily life in general.\nDoctor: Jamie, with all that restless sleep and mental noise, I imagine your energy feels pretty drained. How have you been feeling during the day in terms of your overall fatigue or energy levels? Do you notice times when you feel completely worn out or unusually low on energy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely wiped out all day\u2014some days my energy bounces around, especially if I had a terrible night\u2019s sleep. But honestly, it\u2019s not that classic \u201cI just want to crash\u201d kind of fatigue. Instead, my body feels tense and wired, like even when I\u2019m tired, I can\u2019t just relax. The agitation keeps me on edge, so it\u2019s more like this restless buzz than real exhaustion. That\u2019s frustrating because it messes with any chance I have to actually feel settled or refreshed.\nDoctor: That restless, wired feeling you\u2019re describing\u2014it sounds really exhausting in its own way, Jamie. Not being able to truly relax even when your body feels tired must make everything feel heavier, like you\u2019re trapped in your own head. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by not getting that sense of calm or refreshment you deserve.\nPatient: Exactly. It\u2019s beyond frustrating\u2014like I\u2019m stuck in this relentless loop where my body screams for rest but my mind refuses to shut down. I\u2019m physically drained, but that wired agitation drags me under even more. It\u2019s this exhausting, heavy weight that spills over into everything I do\u2014work, social stuff, even things I used to enjoy. It feels like no matter how hard I try, there\u2019s no escape from this constant buzzing misery. It\u2019s suffocating and\u2014honestly\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep dealing with it.\nDoctor: Jamie, it\u2019s hard to imagine carrying that kind of weight day in and day out. With all this exhaustion and agitation wearing you down, have you noticed if things or activities you used to enjoy don\u2019t feel the same anymore\u2014like you\u2019ve lost interest or pleasure in them?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t completely lost interest in the things I used to care about\u2014not totally. But that constant agitation and exhaustion makes it so damn hard to actually enjoy them. Like, I want to get into my sketching or messing around with music, but most of the time it just feels like I\u2019m pushing through a fog that saps whatever spark those things used to give me. It\u2019s frustrating because the interests are still there, but the tired, wired feeling keeps getting in the way, wearing me down almost every time.\nDoctor: That fog you\u2019re describing\u2014wanting to enjoy something but feeling pushed through like it\u2019s blocked\u2014that\u2019s a heavy space to be in, Jamie. With all that in mind, how often have you been feeling low or down, and how long has that feeling been sticking around?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling low pretty much most days for the past several weeks now. It\u2019s not like a sudden crash but more of this constant, dragging weight that just doesn\u2019t let up. That kind of mood wears you down slowly but thoroughly, and it\u2019s hard to shake off. It seeps into everything, making even small tasks feel like a battle, and I\u2019m tired of feeling stuck like this with no real break.\nDoctor: Jamie, carrying that slow, heavy weight day after day must be so draining, like moving through quicksand with no solid ground in sight. Feeling stuck and worn down like that takes a real toll\u2014it\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re exhausted and worn thin emotionally. What\u2019s it been like for you on a daily basis managing this heaviness? Have you found anything that helps even a little amidst all this?\nPatient: It feels like a constant battle every single day\u2014waking up to that same restless agitation and dragging exhaustion, and just trying to push through like it\u2019s some endless uphill fight. There\u2019s no real relief, no moment where it lets up enough for me to catch my breath. I\u2019ve tried different ways to cope\u2014music, sketching, sometimes just trying to force rest\u2014but none of it sticks or cuts through the buzz in my head. It just cycles back, over and over. It\u2019s raw and brutal, honestly. I\u2019m worn thin, and this endless loop makes me feel trapped, like I\u2019m stuck in a cage with no way out. It\u2019s beyond draining, and sometimes I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can keep up the fight.\nDoctor: Jamie, what you\u2019re describing\u2014the nonstop struggle without a real break\u2014that\u2019s a heavy, relentless toll to bear. I want to check in on another area: have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately, either eating more or less than usual or any weight shifts?\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely noticed some changes. It\u2019s not like a huge swing or anything drastic, but my appetite\u2019s been all over the place because of the agitation. Some days I barely feel like eating, and other times I force myself just to keep going. I\u2019ve skipped meals more than I\u2019d like because I\u2019m too restless or distracted. That just makes the tiredness worse and adds to the mess, and honestly, it\u2019s frustrating having to deal with that on top of everything else.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds tough having your appetite swing like that\u2014some days you barely eat, others you\u2019re pushing yourself, which only adds to the exhaustion. Can you tell me how often you find yourself skipping meals or struggling to eat? And have you noticed any weight changes since this started? How do these shifts affect your mood or energy?\nPatient: I\u2019d say I skip meals fairly regularly\u2014at least a few times a week, maybe more when the restlessness hits hard. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m starving all the time, but the agitation and distraction make it hard to sit down and eat like I should. I\u2019ve noticed some mild weight changes\u2014not extreme, but enough that I can feel it\u2014and that just messes with my energy and mood even more. It\u2019s like one more thing piling onto everything else that\u2019s making this whole situation feel impossible to manage sometimes.\nDoctor: Jamie, juggling restlessness, skipping meals, mood shifts, and those subtle weight changes all at once\u2014no wonder this feels overwhelming and like too much to handle. It\u2019s completely natural to feel frustrated and worn down when everything seems to pile up like this. You\u2019re dealing with a lot, and I\u2019m here to work through it with you.\nPatient: It\u2019s honestly crushing\u2014the nonstop restlessness, the appetite crap, the mood swings, it all just builds up into this weight that drags me down every single day. I\u2019m tired in ways I can\u2019t even fully put into words, like this raw exhaustion that leaks into everything I do. It\u2019s infuriating to feel trapped in this loop with no clear way out. But I appreciate that you\u2019re here and willing to listen\u2014it helps more than I can say, even if the struggle doesn\u2019t let up yet.\nDoctor: Jamie, I\u2019m really glad you feel comfortable sharing this with me\u2014it\u2019s important you don\u2019t have to carry it alone. To help me understand better, have you noticed any changes in how your body moves or feels? Like feeling more restless, pacing, fidgeting, or maybe the opposite\u2014feeling physically or mentally slowed down? Understanding that piece can help us figure out the best ways to support you.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like I\u2019m constantly on edge\u2014I find myself pacing around the room or fidgeting with whatever\u2019s nearby, just trying to get some relief from this tightness in my body. The tension never really lets up; my muscles are always tight, and sitting still feels impossible. Sometimes my mind slows down for a moment, but mostly it\u2019s this restless agitation that dominates, making it hard to feel grounded or calm. It\u2019s exhausting because it\u2019s not just mental\u2014it\u2019s this heavy physical buzz that follows me all day and night, and it makes everything feel harder to manage.\nDoctor: Jamie, that constant physical tension and restlessness sound incredibly draining. How are these feelings impacting your ability to focus, think clearly, or make decisions throughout the day? Is it harder for you to stick with tasks or come to conclusions when your mind is racing like this?\nPatient: It\u2019s brutal. The restless buzz in my body and mind makes it almost impossible to focus or think straight. I\u2019m constantly jumping from one thought to another, and simple tasks suddenly feel like massive obstacles. Making decisions becomes this exhausting, overwhelming process because my brain just won\u2019t settle long enough to weigh things out properly. I get stuck in that cycle of indecisiveness, and it wears me down every single day. It\u2019s not just a little annoyance\u2014this constant agitation is a barrier that keeps me from getting anywhere or feeling grounded.\nDoctor: Jamie, that sounds incredibly tough\u2014the way your mind jumps around and the indecision builds like a wall between you and what you want to do. Can you tell me more about the kinds of decisions or tasks that feel hardest right now? How do you usually try to handle those moments when you feel that stuck, and what goes through your mind when you\u2019re feeling so ungrounded?\nPatient: Even the smallest choices feel impossible\u2014like deciding what to eat or figuring out which task needs to come first turns into this giant, exhausting ordeal. My mind just flips back and forth, overthinking every option and second-guessing until I\u2019m stuck spinning in circles. I try to force myself to act, to push through the mental block, but half the time I just end up paralyzed or switching gears without finishing anything. It drains me completely because the frustration piles up with the agitation, and it\u2019s like this nonstop loop of mental exhaustion that won\u2019t quit.\nDoctor: Jamie, thank you for being so open about how hard this all is\u2014those daily battles with even simple choices sound incredibly draining. I want to ask something important because I care about your safety and well-being: Have you been having any thoughts about death or suicide lately? Understanding this helps me support you in the best way possible.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts of death or suicide. I know it\u2019s an important question, and I appreciate you asking, but despite everything I\u2019m dealing with\u2014the exhaustion, the agitation\u2014that hasn\u2019t crossed my mind. I\u2019m focused on trying to manage things and get through it.\nDoctor: I really appreciate your honesty, Jamie, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re focused on finding ways to manage all this\u2014that\u2019s a strong and important mindset. Since sleep has been such a big issue for you, can you tell me more about what your nights look like\u2014like when you usually go to bed, what keeps you awake, and if there\u2019s anything that helps even a little?\nPatient: I usually try to go to bed around the same time most nights, but that\u2019s where it starts to fall apart. My mind just won\u2019t quiet down, and the agitation in my body keeps me tossing and turning for hours. Nothing really helps\u2014not that I haven\u2019t tried\u2014but it\u2019s mostly the same restless thoughts and tightness that keep me awake until I finally crash, which feels way too late. It\u2019s just how it is at this point, more or less.\nDoctor: Jamie, it sounds incredibly tough to want rest and peace at night but feel trapped by that relentless restlessness and racing mind instead. I want you to know that what you\u2019re going through is real and valid, and I\u2019m here to help you find a way through this\u2014not alone, but together. We\u2019ll work on getting you some relief and more restful nights.\nPatient: Thanks, I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard dealing with all this, but knowing someone\u2019s actually willing to help means a lot. I\u2019m hopeful we can figure something out that makes a difference, even if it\u2019s just small steps at a time.\nDoctor: Jamie, it takes a lot of strength to keep showing up and facing this day after day, especially when it feels so heavy. That hope you have is important\u2014it\u2019s the spark we\u2019ll hold onto as we take those small, meaningful steps forward together. You\u2019re not alone in this, and we\u2019ll work at a pace that feels right for you.\nPatient: I get that\u2014it\u2019s definitely been tough, but I know keeping some hope is critical, even if it\u2019s just a tiny spark right now. I\u2019m realistic about how heavy this all feels day to day, and I\u2019m not expecting things to magically get better overnight. But I\u2019m willing to take those small steps with support\u2014it feels like the only way forward at this point.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
