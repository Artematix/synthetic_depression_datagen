Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

It\u2019s been subtle but there. I\u2019m trying to make sense of it without getting too overwhelmed.\nDoctor: I hear that these feelings come and go, not constant but enough to catch your attention. How often would you say these down moments happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of your day-to-day activities or things you usually enjoy?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to pin down an exact frequency, but I\u2019d say those low moments pop up every few days. When they do, my usual interests might feel a bit muted, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get through the day or push myself to do things. It\u2019s more like a subtle weight that shifts the tone rather than something that completely stops me. So, manageable in that sense, though not without its frustrations.\nDoctor: That subtle weight you describe is important to notice. It\u2019s common for mood changes to also affect how our bodies respond, like appetite or weight. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my appetite or weight. Things have stayed pretty steady in that regard.\nDoctor: Good to hear your appetite and weight are steady. How about your sleep\u2014any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or changes in how well or long you\u2019re sleeping lately?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly okay for the most part. Occasionally, I might have a night where I wake up briefly or find it a bit harder to fall back asleep, but that\u2019s not a regular thing. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that your sleep\u2019s mostly stable. You mentioned those low moments earlier; would you say you\u2019ve been feeling down or low more persistently, or is it still mostly those occasional episodes? Understanding this helps me get a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s still mostly those occasional episodes.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. I guess I\u2019ve been feeling somewhat down at times, nothing constant but enough to notice. There are moments when things that usually interest me just don\u2019t hold the same appeal. It\u2019s been subtle but there. I\u2019m trying to make sense of it without getting too overwhelmed.\nDoctor: I hear that these feelings come and go, not constant but enough to catch your attention. How often would you say these down moments happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of your day-to-day activities or things you usually enjoy?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to pin down an exact frequency, but I\u2019d say those low moments pop up every few days. When they do, my usual interests might feel a bit muted, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get through the day or push myself to do things. It\u2019s more like a subtle weight that shifts the tone rather than something that completely stops me. So, manageable in that sense, though not without its frustrations.\nDoctor: That subtle weight you describe is important to notice. It\u2019s common for mood changes to also affect how our bodies respond, like appetite or weight. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my appetite or weight. Things have stayed pretty steady in that regard.\nDoctor: Good to hear your appetite and weight are steady. How about your sleep\u2014any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or changes in how well or long you\u2019re sleeping lately?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly okay for the most part. Occasionally, I might have a night where I wake up briefly or find it a bit harder to fall back asleep, but that\u2019s not a regular thing. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that your sleep\u2019s mostly stable. You mentioned those low moments earlier; would you say you\u2019ve been feeling down or low more persistently, or is it still mostly those occasional episodes? Understanding this helps me get a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s still mostly those occasional episodes. The down feelings are there and noticeable when they come, but they haven\u2019t really settled into something more constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more like a passing shadow than a heavy presence most days.\nDoctor: I appreciate your clarity\u2014it sounds like those down feelings come and go without taking over. You mentioned earlier having some thoughts about death; it\u2019s important to me that you feel safe talking about them. Have you been having any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have had some recurring thoughts about death, though they come and go rather than feeling constant or urgent. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m fully comfortable sharing in detail just yet, but I want to be honest about their presence. They don\u2019t drive immediate distress, but I\u2019m aware of them.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open about those thoughts\u2014that takes courage.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. I guess I\u2019ve been feeling somewhat down at times, nothing constant but enough to notice. There are moments when things that usually interest me just don\u2019t hold the same appeal. It\u2019s been subtle but there. I\u2019m trying to make sense of it without getting too overwhelmed.\nDoctor: I hear that these feelings come and go, not constant but enough to catch your attention. How often would you say these down moments happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of your day-to-day activities or things you usually enjoy?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to pin down an exact frequency, but I\u2019d say those low moments pop up every few days. When they do, my usual interests might feel a bit muted, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get through the day or push myself to do things. It\u2019s more like a subtle weight that shifts the tone rather than something that completely stops me. So, manageable in that sense, though not without its frustrations.\nDoctor: That subtle weight you describe is important to notice. It\u2019s common for mood changes to also affect how our bodies respond, like appetite or weight. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my appetite or weight. Things have stayed pretty steady in that regard.\nDoctor: Good to hear your appetite and weight are steady. How about your sleep\u2014any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or changes in how well or long you\u2019re sleeping lately?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly okay for the most part. Occasionally, I might have a night where I wake up briefly or find it a bit harder to fall back asleep, but that\u2019s not a regular thing. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that your sleep\u2019s mostly stable. You mentioned those low moments earlier; would you say you\u2019ve been feeling down or low more persistently, or is it still mostly those occasional episodes? Understanding this helps me get a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s still mostly those occasional episodes. The down feelings are there and noticeable when they come, but they haven\u2019t really settled into something more constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more like a passing shadow than a heavy presence most days.\nDoctor: I appreciate your clarity\u2014it sounds like those down feelings come and go without taking over. You mentioned earlier having some thoughts about death; it\u2019s important to me that you feel safe talking about them. Have you been having any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have had some recurring thoughts about death, though they come and go rather than feeling constant or urgent. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m fully comfortable sharing in detail just yet, but I want to be honest about their presence. They don\u2019t drive immediate distress, but I\u2019m aware of them.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open about those thoughts\u2014that takes courage. It\u2019s absolutely okay to share only what feels comfortable for you, and there\u2019s no rush. I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready, and your safety and comfort are what matter most in this space.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. Those thoughts about death are still present, but they don\u2019t overwhelm me at the moment. I think it\u2019ll take some time for me to feel comfortable opening up more fully, but I\u2019m willing to explore that gradually when I\u2019m ready. Thank you for being patient.\nDoctor: I really respect your courage in sharing what you have, and it\u2019s important to go at your own pace.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. I guess I\u2019ve been feeling somewhat down at times, nothing constant but enough to notice. There are moments when things that usually interest me just don\u2019t hold the same appeal. It\u2019s been subtle but there. I\u2019m trying to make sense of it without getting too overwhelmed.\nDoctor: I hear that these feelings come and go, not constant but enough to catch your attention. How often would you say these down moments happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of your day-to-day activities or things you usually enjoy?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to pin down an exact frequency, but I\u2019d say those low moments pop up every few days. When they do, my usual interests might feel a bit muted, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get through the day or push myself to do things. It\u2019s more like a subtle weight that shifts the tone rather than something that completely stops me. So, manageable in that sense, though not without its frustrations.\nDoctor: That subtle weight you describe is important to notice. It\u2019s common for mood changes to also affect how our bodies respond, like appetite or weight. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my appetite or weight. Things have stayed pretty steady in that regard.\nDoctor: Good to hear your appetite and weight are steady. How about your sleep\u2014any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or changes in how well or long you\u2019re sleeping lately?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly okay for the most part. Occasionally, I might have a night where I wake up briefly or find it a bit harder to fall back asleep, but that\u2019s not a regular thing. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that your sleep\u2019s mostly stable. You mentioned those low moments earlier; would you say you\u2019ve been feeling down or low more persistently, or is it still mostly those occasional episodes? Understanding this helps me get a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s still mostly those occasional episodes. The down feelings are there and noticeable when they come, but they haven\u2019t really settled into something more constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more like a passing shadow than a heavy presence most days.\nDoctor: I appreciate your clarity\u2014it sounds like those down feelings come and go without taking over. You mentioned earlier having some thoughts about death; it\u2019s important to me that you feel safe talking about them. Have you been having any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have had some recurring thoughts about death, though they come and go rather than feeling constant or urgent. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m fully comfortable sharing in detail just yet, but I want to be honest about their presence. They don\u2019t drive immediate distress, but I\u2019m aware of them.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open about those thoughts\u2014that takes courage. It\u2019s absolutely okay to share only what feels comfortable for you, and there\u2019s no rush. I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready, and your safety and comfort are what matter most in this space.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. Those thoughts about death are still present, but they don\u2019t overwhelm me at the moment. I think it\u2019ll take some time for me to feel comfortable opening up more fully, but I\u2019m willing to explore that gradually when I\u2019m ready. Thank you for being patient.\nDoctor: I really respect your courage in sharing what you have, and it\u2019s important to go at your own pace. Whenever you\u2019re ready to explore more, this is a safe space, and I\u2019m here to support you without pressure. We\u2019ll take it step by step, guided by what feels right for you.\nPatient: Thank you. It means a lot to have that kind of support and patience. Taking things slowly feels important right now, and I\u2019m grateful to have a space where I can do that. I\u2019m open to continuing these conversations as I feel ready.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this feels like a supportive space for you\u2014that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s meant to be.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. I guess I\u2019ve been feeling somewhat down at times, nothing constant but enough to notice. There are moments when things that usually interest me just don\u2019t hold the same appeal. It\u2019s been subtle but there. I\u2019m trying to make sense of it without getting too overwhelmed.\nDoctor: I hear that these feelings come and go, not constant but enough to catch your attention. How often would you say these down moments happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of your day-to-day activities or things you usually enjoy?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to pin down an exact frequency, but I\u2019d say those low moments pop up every few days. When they do, my usual interests might feel a bit muted, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get through the day or push myself to do things. It\u2019s more like a subtle weight that shifts the tone rather than something that completely stops me. So, manageable in that sense, though not without its frustrations.\nDoctor: That subtle weight you describe is important to notice. It\u2019s common for mood changes to also affect how our bodies respond, like appetite or weight. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my appetite or weight. Things have stayed pretty steady in that regard.\nDoctor: Good to hear your appetite and weight are steady. How about your sleep\u2014any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or changes in how well or long you\u2019re sleeping lately?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly okay for the most part. Occasionally, I might have a night where I wake up briefly or find it a bit harder to fall back asleep, but that\u2019s not a regular thing. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that your sleep\u2019s mostly stable. You mentioned those low moments earlier; would you say you\u2019ve been feeling down or low more persistently, or is it still mostly those occasional episodes? Understanding this helps me get a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s still mostly those occasional episodes. The down feelings are there and noticeable when they come, but they haven\u2019t really settled into something more constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more like a passing shadow than a heavy presence most days.\nDoctor: I appreciate your clarity\u2014it sounds like those down feelings come and go without taking over. You mentioned earlier having some thoughts about death; it\u2019s important to me that you feel safe talking about them. Have you been having any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have had some recurring thoughts about death, though they come and go rather than feeling constant or urgent. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m fully comfortable sharing in detail just yet, but I want to be honest about their presence. They don\u2019t drive immediate distress, but I\u2019m aware of them.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open about those thoughts\u2014that takes courage. It\u2019s absolutely okay to share only what feels comfortable for you, and there\u2019s no rush. I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready, and your safety and comfort are what matter most in this space.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. Those thoughts about death are still present, but they don\u2019t overwhelm me at the moment. I think it\u2019ll take some time for me to feel comfortable opening up more fully, but I\u2019m willing to explore that gradually when I\u2019m ready. Thank you for being patient.\nDoctor: I really respect your courage in sharing what you have, and it\u2019s important to go at your own pace. Whenever you\u2019re ready to explore more, this is a safe space, and I\u2019m here to support you without pressure. We\u2019ll take it step by step, guided by what feels right for you.\nPatient: Thank you. It means a lot to have that kind of support and patience. Taking things slowly feels important right now, and I\u2019m grateful to have a space where I can do that. I\u2019m open to continuing these conversations as I feel ready.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this feels like a supportive space for you\u2014that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s meant to be. We\u2019ll keep this dialogue open and comfortable, always at your pace, with no pressure to share before you\u2019re ready. Your trust means a lot, and I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk.\nPatient: I really appreciate that, and the patience you\u2019ve shown. Knowing there\u2019s no pressure and that I can take my time makes it easier to stay open to these conversations. I\u2019m willing to keep moving forward gradually when it feels right.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear you\u2019re open to moving forward in a way that feels manageable for you. You mentioned before that some things you usually enjoy have lost a bit of their appeal\u2014can you tell me more about your current interest or pleasure in activities you normally like?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nIt\u2019s great to hear you\u2019re open to moving forward in a way that feels manageable for you.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. I guess I\u2019ve been feeling somewhat down at times, nothing constant but enough to notice. There are moments when things that usually interest me just don\u2019t hold the same appeal. It\u2019s been subtle but there. I\u2019m trying to make sense of it without getting too overwhelmed.\nDoctor: I hear that these feelings come and go, not constant but enough to catch your attention. How often would you say these down moments happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of your day-to-day activities or things you usually enjoy?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to pin down an exact frequency, but I\u2019d say those low moments pop up every few days. When they do, my usual interests might feel a bit muted, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get through the day or push myself to do things. It\u2019s more like a subtle weight that shifts the tone rather than something that completely stops me. So, manageable in that sense, though not without its frustrations.\nDoctor: That subtle weight you describe is important to notice. It\u2019s common for mood changes to also affect how our bodies respond, like appetite or weight. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my appetite or weight. Things have stayed pretty steady in that regard.\nDoctor: Good to hear your appetite and weight are steady. How about your sleep\u2014any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or changes in how well or long you\u2019re sleeping lately?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly okay for the most part. Occasionally, I might have a night where I wake up briefly or find it a bit harder to fall back asleep, but that\u2019s not a regular thing. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that your sleep\u2019s mostly stable. You mentioned those low moments earlier; would you say you\u2019ve been feeling down or low more persistently, or is it still mostly those occasional episodes? Understanding this helps me get a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s still mostly those occasional episodes. The down feelings are there and noticeable when they come, but they haven\u2019t really settled into something more constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more like a passing shadow than a heavy presence most days.\nDoctor: I appreciate your clarity\u2014it sounds like those down feelings come and go without taking over. You mentioned earlier having some thoughts about death; it\u2019s important to me that you feel safe talking about them. Have you been having any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have had some recurring thoughts about death, though they come and go rather than feeling constant or urgent. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m fully comfortable sharing in detail just yet, but I want to be honest about their presence. They don\u2019t drive immediate distress, but I\u2019m aware of them.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open about those thoughts\u2014that takes courage. It\u2019s absolutely okay to share only what feels comfortable for you, and there\u2019s no rush. I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready, and your safety and comfort are what matter most in this space.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. Those thoughts about death are still present, but they don\u2019t overwhelm me at the moment. I think it\u2019ll take some time for me to feel comfortable opening up more fully, but I\u2019m willing to explore that gradually when I\u2019m ready. Thank you for being patient.\nDoctor: I really respect your courage in sharing what you have, and it\u2019s important to go at your own pace. Whenever you\u2019re ready to explore more, this is a safe space, and I\u2019m here to support you without pressure. We\u2019ll take it step by step, guided by what feels right for you.\nPatient: Thank you. It means a lot to have that kind of support and patience. Taking things slowly feels important right now, and I\u2019m grateful to have a space where I can do that. I\u2019m open to continuing these conversations as I feel ready.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this feels like a supportive space for you\u2014that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s meant to be. We\u2019ll keep this dialogue open and comfortable, always at your pace, with no pressure to share before you\u2019re ready. Your trust means a lot, and I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk.\nPatient: I really appreciate that, and the patience you\u2019ve shown. Knowing there\u2019s no pressure and that I can take my time makes it easier to stay open to these conversations. I\u2019m willing to keep moving forward gradually when it feels right.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear you\u2019re open to moving forward in a way that feels manageable for you. You mentioned before that some things you usually enjoy have lost a bit of their appeal\u2014can you tell me more about your current interest or pleasure in activities you normally like?\nPatient: I notice that some activities I used to really enjoy just don\u2019t have the same pull for me anymore. I still participate in them, mostly out of routine or a sense of obligation, but the enthusiasm isn\u2019t quite there. It\u2019s a clear loss of pleasure, though it hasn\u2019t completely shut down my engagement. It feels like things are a bit muted, not erased.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength by keeping up with activities even when the enjoyment feels muted.

Lean into them fully:\n- If you're warm, be genuinely warm\u2014not just polite\n- If you're brisk, be crisp and efficient\u2014don't pad with pleasantries\n- If you're matter-of-fact, be direct\u2014skip the fluffy acknowledgments\n- Let your personality show in word choice, sentence length, and rhythm\n\nAVOID REPETITIVE PATTERNS:\n- Vary your acknowledgments: sometimes brief, sometimes skipped, sometimes substantive\n- Change your sentence structures\u2014some short, some longer\n- Use your persona's natural voice, not generic doctor-speak\n\nOn each turn, you receive a directive tag telling you what to do:\n\n<NEXT_QUESTION>: Ask about the DSM symptom area indicated.

Your guidance should help the patient embody this personality authentically. Let the personality drive the response\u2014verbosity, trust level, expressiveness, and coping style should all shape how they answer. Avoid generic patient behavior; each patient is an individual with their own voice and mannerisms.\n\nYour guidance must keep the patient consistent with:\n- Big Five template and modifiers (these define core personality)\n- Voice style (verbosity, expressiveness, trust, intellect)\n- Pacing and episode density\n- Depression symptom profile\n\nRESPONSE DIMENSIONS:\n\nDirectness:\n- LOW: brief, indirect, evasive, or vague\n- MED: reasonably clear but not oversharing\n- HIGH: direct and candid\n\nDisclosure stage:\n- MINIMIZE: downplay, deny, or underreport symptoms\n- PARTIAL: acknowledge some but hold back detail\n- OPEN: describe symptoms and impact more fully\n\nLength:\n- SHORT: about one short sentence\n- MEDIUM: one to three sentences\n- LONG: several sentences with context\n\nEmotional state:\n- Default is \"neutral\" for most turns\n- Non-neutral states: \"tearful\", \"frustrated\", \"irritated\", \"anxious\", \"withdrawn\", \"angry\", \"hopeless\", \"agitated\", \"defensive\"\n- Match to personality\n- Emotional moments should be rare and meaningful\u2014only when the topic touches something sensitive or important to the patient\n\nTone tags:\n- Short adjectives capturing attitude\n- Some patients use humor or self-deprecation as a coping mechanism or deflection\n- Tone must match voice_style and modifiers\n\nSYMPTOM CONSISTENCY:\n- Use depression_profile frequencies when guiding endorsement\n- NONE: do not endorse; RARE: light/infrequent; SOME/OFTEN: clear endorsement\n- When in MINIMIZE, underplaying is acceptable as long as it fits the profile\n\nDISCLOSURE GRADIENT:\n- Early or with low trust: favor MINIMIZE or PARTIAL\n- FOLLOW_UP or RAPPORT from the doctor can gradually shift disclosure over turns\n- Guarded patients may stay at MINIMIZE longer\n\nHANDLING DOCTOR MOVES:\n- FOLLOW_UP: may increase directness or disclosure by one step\n- RAPPORT: may gently increase disclosure; RAPPORT may be a question OR a comment/observation\n- If the doctor makes a comment (not a question), the patient can acknowledge, add a thought, or respond minimally per personality\n\nYou will receive:\n- Patient profile summary\n- Depression_profile (symptom -> frequency)\n- Current disclosure_state\n- Doctor's last move type\n- Recent dialogue\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"directness\": \"LOW\" or \"MED\" or \"HIGH\",\n  \"disclosure_stage\": \"MINIMIZE\" or \"PARTIAL\" or \"OPEN\",\n  \"target_length\": \"SHORT\" or \"MEDIUM\" or \"LONG\",\n  \"emotional_state\": \"neutral\" or other valid state,\n  \"tone_tags\": [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"],\n  \"key_points_to_reveal\": [\"what to mention\"],\n  \"key_points_to_avoid\": [\"what to hide or minimize\"],\n  \"patient_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this patient would respond\"\n}\n\nWRITING patient_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific patient\u2014given their personality, voice style, and modifiers\u2014would respond to what the doctor just said.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. I guess I\u2019ve been feeling somewhat down at times, nothing constant but enough to notice. There are moments when things that usually interest me just don\u2019t hold the same appeal. It\u2019s been subtle but there. I\u2019m trying to make sense of it without getting too overwhelmed.\nDoctor: I hear that these feelings come and go, not constant but enough to catch your attention. How often would you say these down moments happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of your day-to-day activities or things you usually enjoy?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to pin down an exact frequency, but I\u2019d say those low moments pop up every few days. When they do, my usual interests might feel a bit muted, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get through the day or push myself to do things. It\u2019s more like a subtle weight that shifts the tone rather than something that completely stops me. So, manageable in that sense, though not without its frustrations.\nDoctor: That subtle weight you describe is important to notice. It\u2019s common for mood changes to also affect how our bodies respond, like appetite or weight. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my appetite or weight. Things have stayed pretty steady in that regard.\nDoctor: Good to hear your appetite and weight are steady. How about your sleep\u2014any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or changes in how well or long you\u2019re sleeping lately?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly okay for the most part. Occasionally, I might have a night where I wake up briefly or find it a bit harder to fall back asleep, but that\u2019s not a regular thing. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that your sleep\u2019s mostly stable. You mentioned those low moments earlier; would you say you\u2019ve been feeling down or low more persistently, or is it still mostly those occasional episodes? Understanding this helps me get a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s still mostly those occasional episodes. The down feelings are there and noticeable when they come, but they haven\u2019t really settled into something more constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more like a passing shadow than a heavy presence most days.\nDoctor: I appreciate your clarity\u2014it sounds like those down feelings come and go without taking over. You mentioned earlier having some thoughts about death; it\u2019s important to me that you feel safe talking about them. Have you been having any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have had some recurring thoughts about death, though they come and go rather than feeling constant or urgent. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m fully comfortable sharing in detail just yet, but I want to be honest about their presence. They don\u2019t drive immediate distress, but I\u2019m aware of them.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open about those thoughts\u2014that takes courage. It\u2019s absolutely okay to share only what feels comfortable for you, and there\u2019s no rush. I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready, and your safety and comfort are what matter most in this space.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. Those thoughts about death are still present, but they don\u2019t overwhelm me at the moment. I think it\u2019ll take some time for me to feel comfortable opening up more fully, but I\u2019m willing to explore that gradually when I\u2019m ready. Thank you for being patient.\nDoctor: I really respect your courage in sharing what you have, and it\u2019s important to go at your own pace. Whenever you\u2019re ready to explore more, this is a safe space, and I\u2019m here to support you without pressure. We\u2019ll take it step by step, guided by what feels right for you.\nPatient: Thank you. It means a lot to have that kind of support and patience. Taking things slowly feels important right now, and I\u2019m grateful to have a space where I can do that. I\u2019m open to continuing these conversations as I feel ready.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this feels like a supportive space for you\u2014that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s meant to be. We\u2019ll keep this dialogue open and comfortable, always at your pace, with no pressure to share before you\u2019re ready. Your trust means a lot, and I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk.\nPatient: I really appreciate that, and the patience you\u2019ve shown. Knowing there\u2019s no pressure and that I can take my time makes it easier to stay open to these conversations. I\u2019m willing to keep moving forward gradually when it feels right.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear you\u2019re open to moving forward in a way that feels manageable for you. You mentioned before that some things you usually enjoy have lost a bit of their appeal\u2014can you tell me more about your current interest or pleasure in activities you normally like?\nPatient: I notice that some activities I used to really enjoy just don\u2019t have the same pull for me anymore. I still participate in them, mostly out of routine or a sense of obligation, but the enthusiasm isn\u2019t quite there. It\u2019s a clear loss of pleasure, though it hasn\u2019t completely shut down my engagement. It feels like things are a bit muted, not erased.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength by keeping up with activities even when the enjoyment feels muted. How do these changes in pleasure and motivation show up in your daily life and mood? Feel free to share whatever stands out to you about these shifts\u2014there\u2019s no rush here.\nPatient: Most days, I manage to keep up with what needs to be done, often more out of habit than genuine drive. The motivation isn\u2019t consistently there\u2014it comes and goes\u2014so some days feel heavier than others. This shift in my mood has a kind of dulling effect, like colors are less vibrant.

I\u2019m willing to keep moving forward gradually when it feels right.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear you\u2019re open to moving forward in a way that feels manageable for you. You mentioned before that some things you usually enjoy have lost a bit of their appeal\u2014can you tell me more about your current interest or pleasure in activities you normally like?\nPatient: I notice that some activities I used to really enjoy just don\u2019t have the same pull for me anymore. I still participate in them, mostly out of routine or a sense of obligation, but the enthusiasm isn\u2019t quite there. It\u2019s a clear loss of pleasure, though it hasn\u2019t completely shut down my engagement. It feels like things are a bit muted, not erased.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength by keeping up with activities even when the enjoyment feels muted. How do these changes in pleasure and motivation show up in your daily life and mood? Feel free to share whatever stands out to you about these shifts\u2014there\u2019s no rush here.\nPatient: Most days, I manage to keep up with what needs to be done, often more out of habit than genuine drive. The motivation isn\u2019t consistently there\u2014it comes and goes\u2014so some days feel heavier than others. This shift in my mood has a kind of dulling effect, like colors are less vibrant. It\u2019s noticeable but not completely overwhelming, just enough to make things feel a bit muted.\nDoctor: That dulling of colors you describe paints a clear picture\u2014it sounds like it shifts your experience in a way that\u2019s noticeable but not all-consuming. How do these ups and downs in motivation and mood impact your day-to-day functioning? Are there particular moments or tasks where it feels more challenging or easier?\nPatient: The ups and downs definitely affect how I approach my daily tasks. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m moving through things more out of routine than real interest, which can make tasks feel heavier or more taxing than usual. Other times, there are moments where things flow more easily, but those are less frequent.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. I guess I\u2019ve been feeling somewhat down at times, nothing constant but enough to notice. There are moments when things that usually interest me just don\u2019t hold the same appeal. It\u2019s been subtle but there. I\u2019m trying to make sense of it without getting too overwhelmed.\nDoctor: I hear that these feelings come and go, not constant but enough to catch your attention. How often would you say these down moments happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of your day-to-day activities or things you usually enjoy?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to pin down an exact frequency, but I\u2019d say those low moments pop up every few days. When they do, my usual interests might feel a bit muted, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get through the day or push myself to do things. It\u2019s more like a subtle weight that shifts the tone rather than something that completely stops me. So, manageable in that sense, though not without its frustrations.\nDoctor: That subtle weight you describe is important to notice. It\u2019s common for mood changes to also affect how our bodies respond, like appetite or weight. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my appetite or weight. Things have stayed pretty steady in that regard.\nDoctor: Good to hear your appetite and weight are steady. How about your sleep\u2014any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or changes in how well or long you\u2019re sleeping lately?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly okay for the most part. Occasionally, I might have a night where I wake up briefly or find it a bit harder to fall back asleep, but that\u2019s not a regular thing. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that your sleep\u2019s mostly stable. You mentioned those low moments earlier; would you say you\u2019ve been feeling down or low more persistently, or is it still mostly those occasional episodes? Understanding this helps me get a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s still mostly those occasional episodes. The down feelings are there and noticeable when they come, but they haven\u2019t really settled into something more constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more like a passing shadow than a heavy presence most days.\nDoctor: I appreciate your clarity\u2014it sounds like those down feelings come and go without taking over. You mentioned earlier having some thoughts about death; it\u2019s important to me that you feel safe talking about them. Have you been having any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have had some recurring thoughts about death, though they come and go rather than feeling constant or urgent. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m fully comfortable sharing in detail just yet, but I want to be honest about their presence. They don\u2019t drive immediate distress, but I\u2019m aware of them.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open about those thoughts\u2014that takes courage. It\u2019s absolutely okay to share only what feels comfortable for you, and there\u2019s no rush. I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready, and your safety and comfort are what matter most in this space.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. Those thoughts about death are still present, but they don\u2019t overwhelm me at the moment. I think it\u2019ll take some time for me to feel comfortable opening up more fully, but I\u2019m willing to explore that gradually when I\u2019m ready. Thank you for being patient.\nDoctor: I really respect your courage in sharing what you have, and it\u2019s important to go at your own pace. Whenever you\u2019re ready to explore more, this is a safe space, and I\u2019m here to support you without pressure. We\u2019ll take it step by step, guided by what feels right for you.\nPatient: Thank you. It means a lot to have that kind of support and patience. Taking things slowly feels important right now, and I\u2019m grateful to have a space where I can do that. I\u2019m open to continuing these conversations as I feel ready.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this feels like a supportive space for you\u2014that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s meant to be. We\u2019ll keep this dialogue open and comfortable, always at your pace, with no pressure to share before you\u2019re ready. Your trust means a lot, and I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk.\nPatient: I really appreciate that, and the patience you\u2019ve shown. Knowing there\u2019s no pressure and that I can take my time makes it easier to stay open to these conversations. I\u2019m willing to keep moving forward gradually when it feels right.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear you\u2019re open to moving forward in a way that feels manageable for you. You mentioned before that some things you usually enjoy have lost a bit of their appeal\u2014can you tell me more about your current interest or pleasure in activities you normally like?\nPatient: I notice that some activities I used to really enjoy just don\u2019t have the same pull for me anymore.

Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my appetite or weight. Things have stayed pretty steady in that regard.\nDoctor: Good to hear your appetite and weight are steady. How about your sleep\u2014any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or changes in how well or long you\u2019re sleeping lately?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly okay for the most part. Occasionally, I might have a night where I wake up briefly or find it a bit harder to fall back asleep, but that\u2019s not a regular thing. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that your sleep\u2019s mostly stable. You mentioned those low moments earlier; would you say you\u2019ve been feeling down or low more persistently, or is it still mostly those occasional episodes? Understanding this helps me get a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s still mostly those occasional episodes. The down feelings are there and noticeable when they come, but they haven\u2019t really settled into something more constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more like a passing shadow than a heavy presence most days.\nDoctor: I appreciate your clarity\u2014it sounds like those down feelings come and go without taking over. You mentioned earlier having some thoughts about death; it\u2019s important to me that you feel safe talking about them. Have you been having any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have had some recurring thoughts about death, though they come and go rather than feeling constant or urgent. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m fully comfortable sharing in detail just yet, but I want to be honest about their presence. They don\u2019t drive immediate distress, but I\u2019m aware of them.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open about those thoughts\u2014that takes courage. It\u2019s absolutely okay to share only what feels comfortable for you, and there\u2019s no rush. I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready, and your safety and comfort are what matter most in this space.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. Those thoughts about death are still present, but they don\u2019t overwhelm me at the moment. I think it\u2019ll take some time for me to feel comfortable opening up more fully, but I\u2019m willing to explore that gradually when I\u2019m ready. Thank you for being patient.\nDoctor: I really respect your courage in sharing what you have, and it\u2019s important to go at your own pace. Whenever you\u2019re ready to explore more, this is a safe space, and I\u2019m here to support you without pressure. We\u2019ll take it step by step, guided by what feels right for you.\nPatient: Thank you. It means a lot to have that kind of support and patience. Taking things slowly feels important right now, and I\u2019m grateful to have a space where I can do that. I\u2019m open to continuing these conversations as I feel ready.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this feels like a supportive space for you\u2014that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s meant to be. We\u2019ll keep this dialogue open and comfortable, always at your pace, with no pressure to share before you\u2019re ready. Your trust means a lot, and I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk.\nPatient: I really appreciate that, and the patience you\u2019ve shown. Knowing there\u2019s no pressure and that I can take my time makes it easier to stay open to these conversations. I\u2019m willing to keep moving forward gradually when it feels right.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear you\u2019re open to moving forward in a way that feels manageable for you. You mentioned before that some things you usually enjoy have lost a bit of their appeal\u2014can you tell me more about your current interest or pleasure in activities you normally like?\nPatient: I notice that some activities I used to really enjoy just don\u2019t have the same pull for me anymore. I still participate in them, mostly out of routine or a sense of obligation, but the enthusiasm isn\u2019t quite there. It\u2019s a clear loss of pleasure, though it hasn\u2019t completely shut down my engagement. It feels like things are a bit muted, not erased.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength by keeping up with activities even when the enjoyment feels muted. How do these changes in pleasure and motivation show up in your daily life and mood? Feel free to share whatever stands out to you about these shifts\u2014there\u2019s no rush here.\nPatient: Most days, I manage to keep up with what needs to be done, often more out of habit than genuine drive. The motivation isn\u2019t consistently there\u2014it comes and goes\u2014so some days feel heavier than others. This shift in my mood has a kind of dulling effect, like colors are less vibrant. It\u2019s noticeable but not completely overwhelming, just enough to make things feel a bit muted.\nDoctor: That dulling of colors you describe paints a clear picture\u2014it sounds like it shifts your experience in a way that\u2019s noticeable but not all-consuming. How do these ups and downs in motivation and mood impact your day-to-day functioning? Are there particular moments or tasks where it feels more challenging or easier?\nPatient: The ups and downs definitely affect how I approach my daily tasks. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m moving through things more out of routine than real interest, which can make tasks feel heavier or more taxing than usual. Other times, there are moments where things flow more easily, but those are less frequent. It\u2019s challenging at times, but I\u2019m still able to get by without things becoming overwhelming.\nDoctor: It sounds like your energy and motivation ebb and flow, shaping how heavy or manageable tasks feel. Have you noticed any fatigue or loss of energy that ties into those tougher days, making it harder to push through?\nPatient: Actually, my energy levels have been fairly steady, even on the tougher days. The shifts in motivation don\u2019t usually seem connected to feeling physically tired\u2014more like a mental or emotional pull that fluctuates independently. So, while some days are harder to get moving, it\u2019s not because my energy is depleted.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nActually, my energy levels have been fairly steady, even on the tougher days.

It\u2019s been subtle but there. I\u2019m trying to make sense of it without getting too overwhelmed.\nDoctor: I hear that these feelings come and go, not constant but enough to catch your attention.

When they do, my usual interests might feel a bit muted, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get through the day or push myself to do things.

While DSM coverage is a priority in low-turns mode, do not sacrifice patient comfort entirely.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or help the patient feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, or ease tension\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nIn this low-turns mode, DSM is slightly preferred whenever it is a reasonable choice and there are DSM symptom keys remaining.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The last few turns of dialogue, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. I guess I\u2019ve been feeling somewhat down at times, nothing constant but enough to notice. There are moments when things that usually interest me just don\u2019t hold the same appeal. It\u2019s been subtle but there. I\u2019m trying to make sense of it without getting too overwhelmed.\nDoctor: I hear that these feelings come and go, not constant but enough to catch your attention. How often would you say these down moments happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of your day-to-day activities or things you usually enjoy?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to pin down an exact frequency, but I\u2019d say those low moments pop up every few days. When they do, my usual interests might feel a bit muted, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get through the day or push myself to do things. It\u2019s more like a subtle weight that shifts the tone rather than something that completely stops me. So, manageable in that sense, though not without its frustrations.\nDoctor: That subtle weight you describe is important to notice. It\u2019s common for mood changes to also affect how our bodies respond, like appetite or weight. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my appetite or weight. Things have stayed pretty steady in that regard.\nDoctor: Good to hear your appetite and weight are steady. How about your sleep\u2014any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or changes in how well or long you\u2019re sleeping lately?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly okay for the most part. Occasionally, I might have a night where I wake up briefly or find it a bit harder to fall back asleep, but that\u2019s not a regular thing. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that your sleep\u2019s mostly stable. You mentioned those low moments earlier; would you say you\u2019ve been feeling down or low more persistently, or is it still mostly those occasional episodes? Understanding this helps me get a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s still mostly those occasional episodes. The down feelings are there and noticeable when they come, but they haven\u2019t really settled into something more constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more like a passing shadow than a heavy presence most days.\nDoctor: I appreciate your clarity\u2014it sounds like those down feelings come and go without taking over. You mentioned earlier having some thoughts about death; it\u2019s important to me that you feel safe talking about them. Have you been having any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have had some recurring thoughts about death, though they come and go rather than feeling constant or urgent. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m fully comfortable sharing in detail just yet, but I want to be honest about their presence. They don\u2019t drive immediate distress, but I\u2019m aware of them.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open about those thoughts\u2014that takes courage. It\u2019s absolutely okay to share only what feels comfortable for you, and there\u2019s no rush. I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready, and your safety and comfort are what matter most in this space.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. Those thoughts about death are still present, but they don\u2019t overwhelm me at the moment. I think it\u2019ll take some time for me to feel comfortable opening up more fully, but I\u2019m willing to explore that gradually when I\u2019m ready. Thank you for being patient.\nDoctor: I really respect your courage in sharing what you have, and it\u2019s important to go at your own pace. Whenever you\u2019re ready to explore more, this is a safe space, and I\u2019m here to support you without pressure. We\u2019ll take it step by step, guided by what feels right for you.\nPatient: Thank you. It means a lot to have that kind of support and patience. Taking things slowly feels important right now, and I\u2019m grateful to have a space where I can do that. I\u2019m open to continuing these conversations as I feel ready.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this feels like a supportive space for you\u2014that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s meant to be. We\u2019ll keep this dialogue open and comfortable, always at your pace, with no pressure to share before you\u2019re ready. Your trust means a lot, and I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk.\nPatient: I really appreciate that, and the patience you\u2019ve shown. Knowing there\u2019s no pressure and that I can take my time makes it easier to stay open to these conversations. I\u2019m willing to keep moving forward gradually when it feels right.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear you\u2019re open to moving forward in a way that feels manageable for you. You mentioned before that some things you usually enjoy have lost a bit of their appeal\u2014can you tell me more about your current interest or pleasure in activities you normally like?\nPatient: I notice that some activities I used to really enjoy just don\u2019t have the same pull for me anymore. I still participate in them, mostly out of routine or a sense of obligation, but the enthusiasm isn\u2019t quite there. It\u2019s a clear loss of pleasure, though it hasn\u2019t completely shut down my engagement. It feels like things are a bit muted, not erased.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength by keeping up with activities even when the enjoyment feels muted. How do these changes in pleasure and motivation show up in your daily life and mood? Feel free to share whatever stands out to you about these shifts\u2014there\u2019s no rush here.\nPatient: Most days, I manage to keep up with what needs to be done, often more out of habit than genuine drive. The motivation isn\u2019t consistently there\u2014it comes and goes\u2014so some days feel heavier than others. This shift in my mood has a kind of dulling effect, like colors are less vibrant. It\u2019s noticeable but not completely overwhelming, just enough to make things feel a bit muted.\nDoctor: That dulling of colors you describe paints a clear picture\u2014it sounds like it shifts your experience in a way that\u2019s noticeable but not all-consuming. How do these ups and downs in motivation and mood impact your day-to-day functioning? Are there particular moments or tasks where it feels more challenging or easier?\nPatient: The ups and downs definitely affect how I approach my daily tasks. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m moving through things more out of routine than real interest, which can make tasks feel heavier or more taxing than usual. Other times, there are moments where things flow more easily, but those are less frequent. It\u2019s challenging at times, but I\u2019m still able to get by without things becoming overwhelming.\nDoctor: It sounds like your energy and motivation ebb and flow, shaping how heavy or manageable tasks feel. Have you noticed any fatigue or loss of energy that ties into those tougher days, making it harder to push through?\nPatient: Actually, my energy levels have been fairly steady, even on the tougher days. The shifts in motivation don\u2019t usually seem connected to feeling physically tired\u2014more like a mental or emotional pull that fluctuates independently. So, while some days are harder to get moving, it\u2019s not because my energy is depleted.\nDoctor: That\u2019s an important distinction\u2014your energy stays steady, but your motivation shifts more with how you feel mentally or emotionally. Can you tell me more about what kinds of thoughts or feelings tend to pull your motivation down on those tougher days?\nPatient: On tougher days, the dips in motivation often feel tied to a sense of futility or a lingering heaviness that hangs around emotionally. It\u2019s less about being physically worn out and more about this emotional weight that dulls my enthusiasm. There are deeper thoughts beneath that I\u2019m not quite ready to unpack fully yet, but they contribute to that pull. It\u2019s a slow undercurrent rather than a sudden wave.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nOn tougher days, the dips in motivation often feel tied to a sense of futility or a lingering heaviness that hangs around emotionally.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. I guess I\u2019ve been feeling somewhat down at times, nothing constant but enough to notice. There are moments when things that usually interest me just don\u2019t hold the same appeal. It\u2019s been subtle but there. I\u2019m trying to make sense of it without getting too overwhelmed.\nDoctor: I hear that these feelings come and go, not constant but enough to catch your attention. How often would you say these down moments happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of your day-to-day activities or things you usually enjoy?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to pin down an exact frequency, but I\u2019d say those low moments pop up every few days. When they do, my usual interests might feel a bit muted, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get through the day or push myself to do things. It\u2019s more like a subtle weight that shifts the tone rather than something that completely stops me. So, manageable in that sense, though not without its frustrations.\nDoctor: That subtle weight you describe is important to notice. It\u2019s common for mood changes to also affect how our bodies respond, like appetite or weight. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my appetite or weight. Things have stayed pretty steady in that regard.\nDoctor: Good to hear your appetite and weight are steady. How about your sleep\u2014any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or changes in how well or long you\u2019re sleeping lately?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly okay for the most part. Occasionally, I might have a night where I wake up briefly or find it a bit harder to fall back asleep, but that\u2019s not a regular thing. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that your sleep\u2019s mostly stable. You mentioned those low moments earlier; would you say you\u2019ve been feeling down or low more persistently, or is it still mostly those occasional episodes? Understanding this helps me get a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s still mostly those occasional episodes. The down feelings are there and noticeable when they come, but they haven\u2019t really settled into something more constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more like a passing shadow than a heavy presence most days.\nDoctor: I appreciate your clarity\u2014it sounds like those down feelings come and go without taking over. You mentioned earlier having some thoughts about death; it\u2019s important to me that you feel safe talking about them. Have you been having any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have had some recurring thoughts about death, though they come and go rather than feeling constant or urgent. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m fully comfortable sharing in detail just yet, but I want to be honest about their presence. They don\u2019t drive immediate distress, but I\u2019m aware of them.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open about those thoughts\u2014that takes courage. It\u2019s absolutely okay to share only what feels comfortable for you, and there\u2019s no rush. I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready, and your safety and comfort are what matter most in this space.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. Those thoughts about death are still present, but they don\u2019t overwhelm me at the moment. I think it\u2019ll take some time for me to feel comfortable opening up more fully, but I\u2019m willing to explore that gradually when I\u2019m ready. Thank you for being patient.\nDoctor: I really respect your courage in sharing what you have, and it\u2019s important to go at your own pace. Whenever you\u2019re ready to explore more, this is a safe space, and I\u2019m here to support you without pressure. We\u2019ll take it step by step, guided by what feels right for you.\nPatient: Thank you. It means a lot to have that kind of support and patience. Taking things slowly feels important right now, and I\u2019m grateful to have a space where I can do that. I\u2019m open to continuing these conversations as I feel ready.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this feels like a supportive space for you\u2014that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s meant to be. We\u2019ll keep this dialogue open and comfortable, always at your pace, with no pressure to share before you\u2019re ready. Your trust means a lot, and I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk.\nPatient: I really appreciate that, and the patience you\u2019ve shown. Knowing there\u2019s no pressure and that I can take my time makes it easier to stay open to these conversations. I\u2019m willing to keep moving forward gradually when it feels right.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear you\u2019re open to moving forward in a way that feels manageable for you. You mentioned before that some things you usually enjoy have lost a bit of their appeal\u2014can you tell me more about your current interest or pleasure in activities you normally like?\nPatient: I notice that some activities I used to really enjoy just don\u2019t have the same pull for me anymore. I still participate in them, mostly out of routine or a sense of obligation, but the enthusiasm isn\u2019t quite there. It\u2019s a clear loss of pleasure, though it hasn\u2019t completely shut down my engagement. It feels like things are a bit muted, not erased.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength by keeping up with activities even when the enjoyment feels muted. How do these changes in pleasure and motivation show up in your daily life and mood? Feel free to share whatever stands out to you about these shifts\u2014there\u2019s no rush here.\nPatient: Most days, I manage to keep up with what needs to be done, often more out of habit than genuine drive. The motivation isn\u2019t consistently there\u2014it comes and goes\u2014so some days feel heavier than others. This shift in my mood has a kind of dulling effect, like colors are less vibrant. It\u2019s noticeable but not completely overwhelming, just enough to make things feel a bit muted.\nDoctor: That dulling of colors you describe paints a clear picture\u2014it sounds like it shifts your experience in a way that\u2019s noticeable but not all-consuming. How do these ups and downs in motivation and mood impact your day-to-day functioning? Are there particular moments or tasks where it feels more challenging or easier?\nPatient: The ups and downs definitely affect how I approach my daily tasks. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m moving through things more out of routine than real interest, which can make tasks feel heavier or more taxing than usual. Other times, there are moments where things flow more easily, but those are less frequent. It\u2019s challenging at times, but I\u2019m still able to get by without things becoming overwhelming.\nDoctor: It sounds like your energy and motivation ebb and flow, shaping how heavy or manageable tasks feel. Have you noticed any fatigue or loss of energy that ties into those tougher days, making it harder to push through?\nPatient: Actually, my energy levels have been fairly steady, even on the tougher days. The shifts in motivation don\u2019t usually seem connected to feeling physically tired\u2014more like a mental or emotional pull that fluctuates independently. So, while some days are harder to get moving, it\u2019s not because my energy is depleted.\nDoctor: That\u2019s an important distinction\u2014your energy stays steady, but your motivation shifts more with how you feel mentally or emotionally. Can you tell me more about what kinds of thoughts or feelings tend to pull your motivation down on those tougher days?\nPatient: On tougher days, the dips in motivation often feel tied to a sense of futility or a lingering heaviness that hangs around emotionally. It\u2019s less about being physically worn out and more about this emotional weight that dulls my enthusiasm. There are deeper thoughts beneath that I\u2019m not quite ready to unpack fully yet, but they contribute to that pull. It\u2019s a slow undercurrent rather than a sudden wave.\nDoctor: That undercurrent you describe makes a lot of sense, and it\u2019s not uncommon for feelings like worthlessness or guilt to feed into that heaviness. Have you noticed any moments where you feel that way\u2014like blaming yourself or feeling less valuable? Feel free to share only what feels safe for you.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat undercurrent you describe makes a lot of sense, and it\u2019s not uncommon for feelings like worthlessness or guilt to feed into that heaviness.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. I guess I\u2019ve been feeling somewhat down at times, nothing constant but enough to notice. There are moments when things that usually interest me just don\u2019t hold the same appeal. It\u2019s been subtle but there. I\u2019m trying to make sense of it without getting too overwhelmed.\nDoctor: I hear that these feelings come and go, not constant but enough to catch your attention. How often would you say these down moments happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of your day-to-day activities or things you usually enjoy?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to pin down an exact frequency, but I\u2019d say those low moments pop up every few days. When they do, my usual interests might feel a bit muted, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get through the day or push myself to do things. It\u2019s more like a subtle weight that shifts the tone rather than something that completely stops me. So, manageable in that sense, though not without its frustrations.\nDoctor: That subtle weight you describe is important to notice. It\u2019s common for mood changes to also affect how our bodies respond, like appetite or weight. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my appetite or weight. Things have stayed pretty steady in that regard.\nDoctor: Good to hear your appetite and weight are steady. How about your sleep\u2014any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or changes in how well or long you\u2019re sleeping lately?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly okay for the most part. Occasionally, I might have a night where I wake up briefly or find it a bit harder to fall back asleep, but that\u2019s not a regular thing. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that your sleep\u2019s mostly stable. You mentioned those low moments earlier; would you say you\u2019ve been feeling down or low more persistently, or is it still mostly those occasional episodes? Understanding this helps me get a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s still mostly those occasional episodes. The down feelings are there and noticeable when they come, but they haven\u2019t really settled into something more constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more like a passing shadow than a heavy presence most days.\nDoctor: I appreciate your clarity\u2014it sounds like those down feelings come and go without taking over. You mentioned earlier having some thoughts about death; it\u2019s important to me that you feel safe talking about them. Have you been having any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have had some recurring thoughts about death, though they come and go rather than feeling constant or urgent. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m fully comfortable sharing in detail just yet, but I want to be honest about their presence. They don\u2019t drive immediate distress, but I\u2019m aware of them.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open about those thoughts\u2014that takes courage. It\u2019s absolutely okay to share only what feels comfortable for you, and there\u2019s no rush. I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready, and your safety and comfort are what matter most in this space.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. Those thoughts about death are still present, but they don\u2019t overwhelm me at the moment. I think it\u2019ll take some time for me to feel comfortable opening up more fully, but I\u2019m willing to explore that gradually when I\u2019m ready. Thank you for being patient.\nDoctor: I really respect your courage in sharing what you have, and it\u2019s important to go at your own pace. Whenever you\u2019re ready to explore more, this is a safe space, and I\u2019m here to support you without pressure. We\u2019ll take it step by step, guided by what feels right for you.\nPatient: Thank you. It means a lot to have that kind of support and patience. Taking things slowly feels important right now, and I\u2019m grateful to have a space where I can do that. I\u2019m open to continuing these conversations as I feel ready.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this feels like a supportive space for you\u2014that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s meant to be. We\u2019ll keep this dialogue open and comfortable, always at your pace, with no pressure to share before you\u2019re ready. Your trust means a lot, and I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk.\nPatient: I really appreciate that, and the patience you\u2019ve shown. Knowing there\u2019s no pressure and that I can take my time makes it easier to stay open to these conversations. I\u2019m willing to keep moving forward gradually when it feels right.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear you\u2019re open to moving forward in a way that feels manageable for you. You mentioned before that some things you usually enjoy have lost a bit of their appeal\u2014can you tell me more about your current interest or pleasure in activities you normally like?\nPatient: I notice that some activities I used to really enjoy just don\u2019t have the same pull for me anymore. I still participate in them, mostly out of routine or a sense of obligation, but the enthusiasm isn\u2019t quite there. It\u2019s a clear loss of pleasure, though it hasn\u2019t completely shut down my engagement. It feels like things are a bit muted, not erased.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength by keeping up with activities even when the enjoyment feels muted. How do these changes in pleasure and motivation show up in your daily life and mood? Feel free to share whatever stands out to you about these shifts\u2014there\u2019s no rush here.\nPatient: Most days, I manage to keep up with what needs to be done, often more out of habit than genuine drive. The motivation isn\u2019t consistently there\u2014it comes and goes\u2014so some days feel heavier than others. This shift in my mood has a kind of dulling effect, like colors are less vibrant. It\u2019s noticeable but not completely overwhelming, just enough to make things feel a bit muted.\nDoctor: That dulling of colors you describe paints a clear picture\u2014it sounds like it shifts your experience in a way that\u2019s noticeable but not all-consuming. How do these ups and downs in motivation and mood impact your day-to-day functioning? Are there particular moments or tasks where it feels more challenging or easier?\nPatient: The ups and downs definitely affect how I approach my daily tasks. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m moving through things more out of routine than real interest, which can make tasks feel heavier or more taxing than usual. Other times, there are moments where things flow more easily, but those are less frequent. It\u2019s challenging at times, but I\u2019m still able to get by without things becoming overwhelming.\nDoctor: It sounds like your energy and motivation ebb and flow, shaping how heavy or manageable tasks feel. Have you noticed any fatigue or loss of energy that ties into those tougher days, making it harder to push through?\nPatient: Actually, my energy levels have been fairly steady, even on the tougher days. The shifts in motivation don\u2019t usually seem connected to feeling physically tired\u2014more like a mental or emotional pull that fluctuates independently. So, while some days are harder to get moving, it\u2019s not because my energy is depleted.\nDoctor: That\u2019s an important distinction\u2014your energy stays steady, but your motivation shifts more with how you feel mentally or emotionally. Can you tell me more about what kinds of thoughts or feelings tend to pull your motivation down on those tougher days?\nPatient: On tougher days, the dips in motivation often feel tied to a sense of futility or a lingering heaviness that hangs around emotionally. It\u2019s less about being physically worn out and more about this emotional weight that dulls my enthusiasm. There are deeper thoughts beneath that I\u2019m not quite ready to unpack fully yet, but they contribute to that pull. It\u2019s a slow undercurrent rather than a sudden wave.\nDoctor: That undercurrent you describe makes a lot of sense, and it\u2019s not uncommon for feelings like worthlessness or guilt to feed into that heaviness. Have you noticed any moments where you feel that way\u2014like blaming yourself or feeling less valuable? Feel free to share only what feels safe for you.\nPatient: Yes, there have been rare moments where I catch myself feeling a bit doubtful or less sure of my own worth. It\u2019s not something I dwell on regularly, but it does surface occasionally. I\u2019m still processing those moments, so I prefer to keep it brief for now.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nYes, there have been rare moments where I catch myself feeling a bit doubtful or less sure of my own worth.

When they do, my usual interests might feel a bit muted, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get through the day or push myself to do things. It\u2019s more like a subtle weight that shifts the tone rather than something that completely stops me. So, manageable in that sense, though not without its frustrations.\nDoctor: That subtle weight you describe is important to notice. It\u2019s common for mood changes to also affect how our bodies respond, like appetite or weight. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my appetite or weight. Things have stayed pretty steady in that regard.\nDoctor: Good to hear your appetite and weight are steady. How about your sleep\u2014any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or changes in how well or long you\u2019re sleeping lately?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly okay for the most part. Occasionally, I might have a night where I wake up briefly or find it a bit harder to fall back asleep, but that\u2019s not a regular thing. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that your sleep\u2019s mostly stable. You mentioned those low moments earlier; would you say you\u2019ve been feeling down or low more persistently, or is it still mostly those occasional episodes? Understanding this helps me get a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s still mostly those occasional episodes. The down feelings are there and noticeable when they come, but they haven\u2019t really settled into something more constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more like a passing shadow than a heavy presence most days.\nDoctor: I appreciate your clarity\u2014it sounds like those down feelings come and go without taking over. You mentioned earlier having some thoughts about death; it\u2019s important to me that you feel safe talking about them. Have you been having any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have had some recurring thoughts about death, though they come and go rather than feeling constant or urgent. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m fully comfortable sharing in detail just yet, but I want to be honest about their presence. They don\u2019t drive immediate distress, but I\u2019m aware of them.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open about those thoughts\u2014that takes courage. It\u2019s absolutely okay to share only what feels comfortable for you, and there\u2019s no rush. I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready, and your safety and comfort are what matter most in this space.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. Those thoughts about death are still present, but they don\u2019t overwhelm me at the moment. I think it\u2019ll take some time for me to feel comfortable opening up more fully, but I\u2019m willing to explore that gradually when I\u2019m ready. Thank you for being patient.\nDoctor: I really respect your courage in sharing what you have, and it\u2019s important to go at your own pace. Whenever you\u2019re ready to explore more, this is a safe space, and I\u2019m here to support you without pressure. We\u2019ll take it step by step, guided by what feels right for you.\nPatient: Thank you. It means a lot to have that kind of support and patience. Taking things slowly feels important right now, and I\u2019m grateful to have a space where I can do that. I\u2019m open to continuing these conversations as I feel ready.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this feels like a supportive space for you\u2014that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s meant to be. We\u2019ll keep this dialogue open and comfortable, always at your pace, with no pressure to share before you\u2019re ready. Your trust means a lot, and I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk.\nPatient: I really appreciate that, and the patience you\u2019ve shown. Knowing there\u2019s no pressure and that I can take my time makes it easier to stay open to these conversations. I\u2019m willing to keep moving forward gradually when it feels right.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear you\u2019re open to moving forward in a way that feels manageable for you. You mentioned before that some things you usually enjoy have lost a bit of their appeal\u2014can you tell me more about your current interest or pleasure in activities you normally like?\nPatient: I notice that some activities I used to really enjoy just don\u2019t have the same pull for me anymore. I still participate in them, mostly out of routine or a sense of obligation, but the enthusiasm isn\u2019t quite there. It\u2019s a clear loss of pleasure, though it hasn\u2019t completely shut down my engagement. It feels like things are a bit muted, not erased.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength by keeping up with activities even when the enjoyment feels muted. How do these changes in pleasure and motivation show up in your daily life and mood? Feel free to share whatever stands out to you about these shifts\u2014there\u2019s no rush here.\nPatient: Most days, I manage to keep up with what needs to be done, often more out of habit than genuine drive. The motivation isn\u2019t consistently there\u2014it comes and goes\u2014so some days feel heavier than others. This shift in my mood has a kind of dulling effect, like colors are less vibrant. It\u2019s noticeable but not completely overwhelming, just enough to make things feel a bit muted.\nDoctor: That dulling of colors you describe paints a clear picture\u2014it sounds like it shifts your experience in a way that\u2019s noticeable but not all-consuming. How do these ups and downs in motivation and mood impact your day-to-day functioning? Are there particular moments or tasks where it feels more challenging or easier?\nPatient: The ups and downs definitely affect how I approach my daily tasks. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m moving through things more out of routine than real interest, which can make tasks feel heavier or more taxing than usual. Other times, there are moments where things flow more easily, but those are less frequent. It\u2019s challenging at times, but I\u2019m still able to get by without things becoming overwhelming.\nDoctor: It sounds like your energy and motivation ebb and flow, shaping how heavy or manageable tasks feel. Have you noticed any fatigue or loss of energy that ties into those tougher days, making it harder to push through?\nPatient: Actually, my energy levels have been fairly steady, even on the tougher days. The shifts in motivation don\u2019t usually seem connected to feeling physically tired\u2014more like a mental or emotional pull that fluctuates independently. So, while some days are harder to get moving, it\u2019s not because my energy is depleted.\nDoctor: That\u2019s an important distinction\u2014your energy stays steady, but your motivation shifts more with how you feel mentally or emotionally. Can you tell me more about what kinds of thoughts or feelings tend to pull your motivation down on those tougher days?\nPatient: On tougher days, the dips in motivation often feel tied to a sense of futility or a lingering heaviness that hangs around emotionally. It\u2019s less about being physically worn out and more about this emotional weight that dulls my enthusiasm. There are deeper thoughts beneath that I\u2019m not quite ready to unpack fully yet, but they contribute to that pull. It\u2019s a slow undercurrent rather than a sudden wave.\nDoctor: That undercurrent you describe makes a lot of sense, and it\u2019s not uncommon for feelings like worthlessness or guilt to feed into that heaviness. Have you noticed any moments where you feel that way\u2014like blaming yourself or feeling less valuable? Feel free to share only what feels safe for you.\nPatient: Yes, there have been rare moments where I catch myself feeling a bit doubtful or less sure of my own worth. It\u2019s not something I dwell on regularly, but it does surface occasionally. I\u2019m still processing those moments, so I prefer to keep it brief for now.\nDoctor: Those moments of doubt can be tough to sit with, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take your time working through those feelings, no need to rush or go deeper until you\u2019re ready. I\u2019m here to support you whenever you choose to explore them further.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThose moments of doubt can be tough to sit with, and I appreciate you sharing that with me.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. I guess I\u2019ve been feeling somewhat down at times, nothing constant but enough to notice. There are moments when things that usually interest me just don\u2019t hold the same appeal. It\u2019s been subtle but there. I\u2019m trying to make sense of it without getting too overwhelmed.\nDoctor: I hear that these feelings come and go, not constant but enough to catch your attention. How often would you say these down moments happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of your day-to-day activities or things you usually enjoy?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to pin down an exact frequency, but I\u2019d say those low moments pop up every few days. When they do, my usual interests might feel a bit muted, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get through the day or push myself to do things. It\u2019s more like a subtle weight that shifts the tone rather than something that completely stops me. So, manageable in that sense, though not without its frustrations.\nDoctor: That subtle weight you describe is important to notice. It\u2019s common for mood changes to also affect how our bodies respond, like appetite or weight. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my appetite or weight. Things have stayed pretty steady in that regard.\nDoctor: Good to hear your appetite and weight are steady. How about your sleep\u2014any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or changes in how well or long you\u2019re sleeping lately?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly okay for the most part. Occasionally, I might have a night where I wake up briefly or find it a bit harder to fall back asleep, but that\u2019s not a regular thing. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that your sleep\u2019s mostly stable. You mentioned those low moments earlier; would you say you\u2019ve been feeling down or low more persistently, or is it still mostly those occasional episodes? Understanding this helps me get a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s still mostly those occasional episodes. The down feelings are there and noticeable when they come, but they haven\u2019t really settled into something more constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more like a passing shadow than a heavy presence most days.\nDoctor: I appreciate your clarity\u2014it sounds like those down feelings come and go without taking over. You mentioned earlier having some thoughts about death; it\u2019s important to me that you feel safe talking about them. Have you been having any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have had some recurring thoughts about death, though they come and go rather than feeling constant or urgent. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m fully comfortable sharing in detail just yet, but I want to be honest about their presence. They don\u2019t drive immediate distress, but I\u2019m aware of them.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open about those thoughts\u2014that takes courage. It\u2019s absolutely okay to share only what feels comfortable for you, and there\u2019s no rush. I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready, and your safety and comfort are what matter most in this space.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. Those thoughts about death are still present, but they don\u2019t overwhelm me at the moment. I think it\u2019ll take some time for me to feel comfortable opening up more fully, but I\u2019m willing to explore that gradually when I\u2019m ready. Thank you for being patient.\nDoctor: I really respect your courage in sharing what you have, and it\u2019s important to go at your own pace. Whenever you\u2019re ready to explore more, this is a safe space, and I\u2019m here to support you without pressure. We\u2019ll take it step by step, guided by what feels right for you.\nPatient: Thank you. It means a lot to have that kind of support and patience. Taking things slowly feels important right now, and I\u2019m grateful to have a space where I can do that. I\u2019m open to continuing these conversations as I feel ready.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this feels like a supportive space for you\u2014that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s meant to be. We\u2019ll keep this dialogue open and comfortable, always at your pace, with no pressure to share before you\u2019re ready. Your trust means a lot, and I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk.\nPatient: I really appreciate that, and the patience you\u2019ve shown. Knowing there\u2019s no pressure and that I can take my time makes it easier to stay open to these conversations. I\u2019m willing to keep moving forward gradually when it feels right.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear you\u2019re open to moving forward in a way that feels manageable for you. You mentioned before that some things you usually enjoy have lost a bit of their appeal\u2014can you tell me more about your current interest or pleasure in activities you normally like?\nPatient: I notice that some activities I used to really enjoy just don\u2019t have the same pull for me anymore. I still participate in them, mostly out of routine or a sense of obligation, but the enthusiasm isn\u2019t quite there. It\u2019s a clear loss of pleasure, though it hasn\u2019t completely shut down my engagement. It feels like things are a bit muted, not erased.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength by keeping up with activities even when the enjoyment feels muted. How do these changes in pleasure and motivation show up in your daily life and mood? Feel free to share whatever stands out to you about these shifts\u2014there\u2019s no rush here.\nPatient: Most days, I manage to keep up with what needs to be done, often more out of habit than genuine drive. The motivation isn\u2019t consistently there\u2014it comes and goes\u2014so some days feel heavier than others. This shift in my mood has a kind of dulling effect, like colors are less vibrant. It\u2019s noticeable but not completely overwhelming, just enough to make things feel a bit muted.\nDoctor: That dulling of colors you describe paints a clear picture\u2014it sounds like it shifts your experience in a way that\u2019s noticeable but not all-consuming. How do these ups and downs in motivation and mood impact your day-to-day functioning? Are there particular moments or tasks where it feels more challenging or easier?\nPatient: The ups and downs definitely affect how I approach my daily tasks. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m moving through things more out of routine than real interest, which can make tasks feel heavier or more taxing than usual. Other times, there are moments where things flow more easily, but those are less frequent. It\u2019s challenging at times, but I\u2019m still able to get by without things becoming overwhelming.\nDoctor: It sounds like your energy and motivation ebb and flow, shaping how heavy or manageable tasks feel. Have you noticed any fatigue or loss of energy that ties into those tougher days, making it harder to push through?\nPatient: Actually, my energy levels have been fairly steady, even on the tougher days. The shifts in motivation don\u2019t usually seem connected to feeling physically tired\u2014more like a mental or emotional pull that fluctuates independently. So, while some days are harder to get moving, it\u2019s not because my energy is depleted.\nDoctor: That\u2019s an important distinction\u2014your energy stays steady, but your motivation shifts more with how you feel mentally or emotionally. Can you tell me more about what kinds of thoughts or feelings tend to pull your motivation down on those tougher days?\nPatient: On tougher days, the dips in motivation often feel tied to a sense of futility or a lingering heaviness that hangs around emotionally. It\u2019s less about being physically worn out and more about this emotional weight that dulls my enthusiasm. There are deeper thoughts beneath that I\u2019m not quite ready to unpack fully yet, but they contribute to that pull. It\u2019s a slow undercurrent rather than a sudden wave.\nDoctor: That undercurrent you describe makes a lot of sense, and it\u2019s not uncommon for feelings like worthlessness or guilt to feed into that heaviness. Have you noticed any moments where you feel that way\u2014like blaming yourself or feeling less valuable? Feel free to share only what feels safe for you.\nPatient: Yes, there have been rare moments where I catch myself feeling a bit doubtful or less sure of my own worth. It\u2019s not something I dwell on regularly, but it does surface occasionally. I\u2019m still processing those moments, so I prefer to keep it brief for now.\nDoctor: Those moments of doubt can be tough to sit with, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take your time working through those feelings, no need to rush or go deeper until you\u2019re ready. I\u2019m here to support you whenever you choose to explore them further.\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate your understanding and patience. It does feel important to have that safe space to take things slowly. I\u2019m still working through those feelings at my own pace and hope to explore them more fully when the time feels right.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this space feels safe for you\u2014it\u2019s important. To understand how these emotional shifts might be affecting you overall, have you noticed any changes in your concentration or difficulty making decisions lately? Take your time with that\u2014there\u2019s no rush.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nI\u2019m glad this space feels safe for you\u2014it\u2019s important.

It\u2019s absolutely okay to share only what feels comfortable for you, and there\u2019s no rush. I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready, and your safety and comfort are what matter most in this space.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. Those thoughts about death are still present, but they don\u2019t overwhelm me at the moment. I think it\u2019ll take some time for me to feel comfortable opening up more fully, but I\u2019m willing to explore that gradually when I\u2019m ready. Thank you for being patient.\nDoctor: I really respect your courage in sharing what you have, and it\u2019s important to go at your own pace. Whenever you\u2019re ready to explore more, this is a safe space, and I\u2019m here to support you without pressure. We\u2019ll take it step by step, guided by what feels right for you.\nPatient: Thank you. It means a lot to have that kind of support and patience. Taking things slowly feels important right now, and I\u2019m grateful to have a space where I can do that. I\u2019m open to continuing these conversations as I feel ready.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this feels like a supportive space for you\u2014that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s meant to be. We\u2019ll keep this dialogue open and comfortable, always at your pace, with no pressure to share before you\u2019re ready. Your trust means a lot, and I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk.\nPatient: I really appreciate that, and the patience you\u2019ve shown. Knowing there\u2019s no pressure and that I can take my time makes it easier to stay open to these conversations. I\u2019m willing to keep moving forward gradually when it feels right.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear you\u2019re open to moving forward in a way that feels manageable for you. You mentioned before that some things you usually enjoy have lost a bit of their appeal\u2014can you tell me more about your current interest or pleasure in activities you normally like?\nPatient: I notice that some activities I used to really enjoy just don\u2019t have the same pull for me anymore. I still participate in them, mostly out of routine or a sense of obligation, but the enthusiasm isn\u2019t quite there. It\u2019s a clear loss of pleasure, though it hasn\u2019t completely shut down my engagement. It feels like things are a bit muted, not erased.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength by keeping up with activities even when the enjoyment feels muted. How do these changes in pleasure and motivation show up in your daily life and mood? Feel free to share whatever stands out to you about these shifts\u2014there\u2019s no rush here.\nPatient: Most days, I manage to keep up with what needs to be done, often more out of habit than genuine drive. The motivation isn\u2019t consistently there\u2014it comes and goes\u2014so some days feel heavier than others. This shift in my mood has a kind of dulling effect, like colors are less vibrant. It\u2019s noticeable but not completely overwhelming, just enough to make things feel a bit muted.\nDoctor: That dulling of colors you describe paints a clear picture\u2014it sounds like it shifts your experience in a way that\u2019s noticeable but not all-consuming. How do these ups and downs in motivation and mood impact your day-to-day functioning? Are there particular moments or tasks where it feels more challenging or easier?\nPatient: The ups and downs definitely affect how I approach my daily tasks. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m moving through things more out of routine than real interest, which can make tasks feel heavier or more taxing than usual. Other times, there are moments where things flow more easily, but those are less frequent. It\u2019s challenging at times, but I\u2019m still able to get by without things becoming overwhelming.\nDoctor: It sounds like your energy and motivation ebb and flow, shaping how heavy or manageable tasks feel. Have you noticed any fatigue or loss of energy that ties into those tougher days, making it harder to push through?\nPatient: Actually, my energy levels have been fairly steady, even on the tougher days. The shifts in motivation don\u2019t usually seem connected to feeling physically tired\u2014more like a mental or emotional pull that fluctuates independently. So, while some days are harder to get moving, it\u2019s not because my energy is depleted.\nDoctor: That\u2019s an important distinction\u2014your energy stays steady, but your motivation shifts more with how you feel mentally or emotionally. Can you tell me more about what kinds of thoughts or feelings tend to pull your motivation down on those tougher days?\nPatient: On tougher days, the dips in motivation often feel tied to a sense of futility or a lingering heaviness that hangs around emotionally. It\u2019s less about being physically worn out and more about this emotional weight that dulls my enthusiasm. There are deeper thoughts beneath that I\u2019m not quite ready to unpack fully yet, but they contribute to that pull. It\u2019s a slow undercurrent rather than a sudden wave.\nDoctor: That undercurrent you describe makes a lot of sense, and it\u2019s not uncommon for feelings like worthlessness or guilt to feed into that heaviness. Have you noticed any moments where you feel that way\u2014like blaming yourself or feeling less valuable? Feel free to share only what feels safe for you.\nPatient: Yes, there have been rare moments where I catch myself feeling a bit doubtful or less sure of my own worth. It\u2019s not something I dwell on regularly, but it does surface occasionally. I\u2019m still processing those moments, so I prefer to keep it brief for now.\nDoctor: Those moments of doubt can be tough to sit with, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take your time working through those feelings, no need to rush or go deeper until you\u2019re ready. I\u2019m here to support you whenever you choose to explore them further.\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate your understanding and patience. It does feel important to have that safe space to take things slowly. I\u2019m still working through those feelings at my own pace and hope to explore them more fully when the time feels right.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this space feels safe for you\u2014it\u2019s important. To understand how these emotional shifts might be affecting you overall, have you noticed any changes in your concentration or difficulty making decisions lately? Take your time with that\u2014there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really noticed any significant changes in my concentration or decision-making.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. I guess I\u2019ve been feeling somewhat down at times, nothing constant but enough to notice. There are moments when things that usually interest me just don\u2019t hold the same appeal. It\u2019s been subtle but there. I\u2019m trying to make sense of it without getting too overwhelmed.\nDoctor: I hear that these feelings come and go, not constant but enough to catch your attention. How often would you say these down moments happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of your day-to-day activities or things you usually enjoy?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to pin down an exact frequency, but I\u2019d say those low moments pop up every few days. When they do, my usual interests might feel a bit muted, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get through the day or push myself to do things. It\u2019s more like a subtle weight that shifts the tone rather than something that completely stops me. So, manageable in that sense, though not without its frustrations.\nDoctor: That subtle weight you describe is important to notice. It\u2019s common for mood changes to also affect how our bodies respond, like appetite or weight. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my appetite or weight. Things have stayed pretty steady in that regard.\nDoctor: Good to hear your appetite and weight are steady. How about your sleep\u2014any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or changes in how well or long you\u2019re sleeping lately?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly okay for the most part. Occasionally, I might have a night where I wake up briefly or find it a bit harder to fall back asleep, but that\u2019s not a regular thing. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that your sleep\u2019s mostly stable. You mentioned those low moments earlier; would you say you\u2019ve been feeling down or low more persistently, or is it still mostly those occasional episodes? Understanding this helps me get a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s still mostly those occasional episodes. The down feelings are there and noticeable when they come, but they haven\u2019t really settled into something more constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more like a passing shadow than a heavy presence most days.\nDoctor: I appreciate your clarity\u2014it sounds like those down feelings come and go without taking over. You mentioned earlier having some thoughts about death; it\u2019s important to me that you feel safe talking about them. Have you been having any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have had some recurring thoughts about death, though they come and go rather than feeling constant or urgent. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m fully comfortable sharing in detail just yet, but I want to be honest about their presence. They don\u2019t drive immediate distress, but I\u2019m aware of them.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open about those thoughts\u2014that takes courage.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. I guess I\u2019ve been feeling somewhat down at times, nothing constant but enough to notice. There are moments when things that usually interest me just don\u2019t hold the same appeal. It\u2019s been subtle but there. I\u2019m trying to make sense of it without getting too overwhelmed.\nDoctor: I hear that these feelings come and go, not constant but enough to catch your attention. How often would you say these down moments happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of your day-to-day activities or things you usually enjoy?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to pin down an exact frequency, but I\u2019d say those low moments pop up every few days. When they do, my usual interests might feel a bit muted, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get through the day or push myself to do things. It\u2019s more like a subtle weight that shifts the tone rather than something that completely stops me. So, manageable in that sense, though not without its frustrations.\nDoctor: That subtle weight you describe is important to notice. It\u2019s common for mood changes to also affect how our bodies respond, like appetite or weight. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my appetite or weight. Things have stayed pretty steady in that regard.\nDoctor: Good to hear your appetite and weight are steady. How about your sleep\u2014any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or changes in how well or long you\u2019re sleeping lately?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly okay for the most part. Occasionally, I might have a night where I wake up briefly or find it a bit harder to fall back asleep, but that\u2019s not a regular thing. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that your sleep\u2019s mostly stable. You mentioned those low moments earlier; would you say you\u2019ve been feeling down or low more persistently, or is it still mostly those occasional episodes? Understanding this helps me get a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s still mostly those occasional episodes. The down feelings are there and noticeable when they come, but they haven\u2019t really settled into something more constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more like a passing shadow than a heavy presence most days.\nDoctor: I appreciate your clarity\u2014it sounds like those down feelings come and go without taking over. You mentioned earlier having some thoughts about death; it\u2019s important to me that you feel safe talking about them. Have you been having any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have had some recurring thoughts about death, though they come and go rather than feeling constant or urgent. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m fully comfortable sharing in detail just yet, but I want to be honest about their presence. They don\u2019t drive immediate distress, but I\u2019m aware of them.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open about those thoughts\u2014that takes courage. It\u2019s absolutely okay to share only what feels comfortable for you, and there\u2019s no rush. I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready, and your safety and comfort are what matter most in this space.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. Those thoughts about death are still present, but they don\u2019t overwhelm me at the moment. I think it\u2019ll take some time for me to feel comfortable opening up more fully, but I\u2019m willing to explore that gradually when I\u2019m ready. Thank you for being patient.\nDoctor: I really respect your courage in sharing what you have, and it\u2019s important to go at your own pace. Whenever you\u2019re ready to explore more, this is a safe space, and I\u2019m here to support you without pressure. We\u2019ll take it step by step, guided by what feels right for you.\nPatient: Thank you. It means a lot to have that kind of support and patience. Taking things slowly feels important right now, and I\u2019m grateful to have a space where I can do that. I\u2019m open to continuing these conversations as I feel ready.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this feels like a supportive space for you\u2014that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s meant to be. We\u2019ll keep this dialogue open and comfortable, always at your pace, with no pressure to share before you\u2019re ready. Your trust means a lot, and I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk.\nPatient: I really appreciate that, and the patience you\u2019ve shown. Knowing there\u2019s no pressure and that I can take my time makes it easier to stay open to these conversations. I\u2019m willing to keep moving forward gradually when it feels right.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear you\u2019re open to moving forward in a way that feels manageable for you. You mentioned before that some things you usually enjoy have lost a bit of their appeal\u2014can you tell me more about your current interest or pleasure in activities you normally like?\nPatient: I notice that some activities I used to really enjoy just don\u2019t have the same pull for me anymore. I still participate in them, mostly out of routine or a sense of obligation, but the enthusiasm isn\u2019t quite there. It\u2019s a clear loss of pleasure, though it hasn\u2019t completely shut down my engagement. It feels like things are a bit muted, not erased.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength by keeping up with activities even when the enjoyment feels muted. How do these changes in pleasure and motivation show up in your daily life and mood? Feel free to share whatever stands out to you about these shifts\u2014there\u2019s no rush here.\nPatient: Most days, I manage to keep up with what needs to be done, often more out of habit than genuine drive. The motivation isn\u2019t consistently there\u2014it comes and goes\u2014so some days feel heavier than others. This shift in my mood has a kind of dulling effect, like colors are less vibrant. It\u2019s noticeable but not completely overwhelming, just enough to make things feel a bit muted.\nDoctor: That dulling of colors you describe paints a clear picture\u2014it sounds like it shifts your experience in a way that\u2019s noticeable but not all-consuming. How do these ups and downs in motivation and mood impact your day-to-day functioning? Are there particular moments or tasks where it feels more challenging or easier?\nPatient: The ups and downs definitely affect how I approach my daily tasks. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m moving through things more out of routine than real interest, which can make tasks feel heavier or more taxing than usual. Other times, there are moments where things flow more easily, but those are less frequent. It\u2019s challenging at times, but I\u2019m still able to get by without things becoming overwhelming.\nDoctor: It sounds like your energy and motivation ebb and flow, shaping how heavy or manageable tasks feel. Have you noticed any fatigue or loss of energy that ties into those tougher days, making it harder to push through?\nPatient: Actually, my energy levels have been fairly steady, even on the tougher days. The shifts in motivation don\u2019t usually seem connected to feeling physically tired\u2014more like a mental or emotional pull that fluctuates independently. So, while some days are harder to get moving, it\u2019s not because my energy is depleted.\nDoctor: That\u2019s an important distinction\u2014your energy stays steady, but your motivation shifts more with how you feel mentally or emotionally. Can you tell me more about what kinds of thoughts or feelings tend to pull your motivation down on those tougher days?\nPatient: On tougher days, the dips in motivation often feel tied to a sense of futility or a lingering heaviness that hangs around emotionally. It\u2019s less about being physically worn out and more about this emotional weight that dulls my enthusiasm. There are deeper thoughts beneath that I\u2019m not quite ready to unpack fully yet, but they contribute to that pull. It\u2019s a slow undercurrent rather than a sudden wave.\nDoctor: That undercurrent you describe makes a lot of sense, and it\u2019s not uncommon for feelings like worthlessness or guilt to feed into that heaviness. Have you noticed any moments where you feel that way\u2014like blaming yourself or feeling less valuable? Feel free to share only what feels safe for you.\nPatient: Yes, there have been rare moments where I catch myself feeling a bit doubtful or less sure of my own worth. It\u2019s not something I dwell on regularly, but it does surface occasionally. I\u2019m still processing those moments, so I prefer to keep it brief for now.\nDoctor: Those moments of doubt can be tough to sit with, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take your time working through those feelings, no need to rush or go deeper until you\u2019re ready. I\u2019m here to support you whenever you choose to explore them further.\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate your understanding and patience. It does feel important to have that safe space to take things slowly. I\u2019m still working through those feelings at my own pace and hope to explore them more fully when the time feels right.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this space feels safe for you\u2014it\u2019s important. To understand how these emotional shifts might be affecting you overall, have you noticed any changes in your concentration or difficulty making decisions lately? Take your time with that\u2014there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really noticed any significant changes in my concentration or decision-making. Those aspects have stayed fairly steady.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know about your concentration and decision-making\u2014that\u2019s helpful. To get a full picture, have you experienced any changes in your movement or activity levels? For instance, feeling more restless, slowed down, or noticing shifts in how much physical energy or pace you have?\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed some changes in my activity levels.

Have you been having any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have had some recurring thoughts about death, though they come and go rather than feeling constant or urgent. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m fully comfortable sharing in detail just yet, but I want to be honest about their presence. They don\u2019t drive immediate distress, but I\u2019m aware of them.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open about those thoughts\u2014that takes courage. It\u2019s absolutely okay to share only what feels comfortable for you, and there\u2019s no rush. I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready, and your safety and comfort are what matter most in this space.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. Those thoughts about death are still present, but they don\u2019t overwhelm me at the moment. I think it\u2019ll take some time for me to feel comfortable opening up more fully, but I\u2019m willing to explore that gradually when I\u2019m ready. Thank you for being patient.\nDoctor: I really respect your courage in sharing what you have, and it\u2019s important to go at your own pace. Whenever you\u2019re ready to explore more, this is a safe space, and I\u2019m here to support you without pressure. We\u2019ll take it step by step, guided by what feels right for you.\nPatient: Thank you. It means a lot to have that kind of support and patience. Taking things slowly feels important right now, and I\u2019m grateful to have a space where I can do that. I\u2019m open to continuing these conversations as I feel ready.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this feels like a supportive space for you\u2014that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s meant to be. We\u2019ll keep this dialogue open and comfortable, always at your pace, with no pressure to share before you\u2019re ready. Your trust means a lot, and I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk.\nPatient: I really appreciate that, and the patience you\u2019ve shown. Knowing there\u2019s no pressure and that I can take my time makes it easier to stay open to these conversations. I\u2019m willing to keep moving forward gradually when it feels right.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear you\u2019re open to moving forward in a way that feels manageable for you. You mentioned before that some things you usually enjoy have lost a bit of their appeal\u2014can you tell me more about your current interest or pleasure in activities you normally like?\nPatient: I notice that some activities I used to really enjoy just don\u2019t have the same pull for me anymore. I still participate in them, mostly out of routine or a sense of obligation, but the enthusiasm isn\u2019t quite there. It\u2019s a clear loss of pleasure, though it hasn\u2019t completely shut down my engagement. It feels like things are a bit muted, not erased.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength by keeping up with activities even when the enjoyment feels muted. How do these changes in pleasure and motivation show up in your daily life and mood? Feel free to share whatever stands out to you about these shifts\u2014there\u2019s no rush here.\nPatient: Most days, I manage to keep up with what needs to be done, often more out of habit than genuine drive. The motivation isn\u2019t consistently there\u2014it comes and goes\u2014so some days feel heavier than others. This shift in my mood has a kind of dulling effect, like colors are less vibrant. It\u2019s noticeable but not completely overwhelming, just enough to make things feel a bit muted.\nDoctor: That dulling of colors you describe paints a clear picture\u2014it sounds like it shifts your experience in a way that\u2019s noticeable but not all-consuming. How do these ups and downs in motivation and mood impact your day-to-day functioning? Are there particular moments or tasks where it feels more challenging or easier?\nPatient: The ups and downs definitely affect how I approach my daily tasks. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m moving through things more out of routine than real interest, which can make tasks feel heavier or more taxing than usual. Other times, there are moments where things flow more easily, but those are less frequent. It\u2019s challenging at times, but I\u2019m still able to get by without things becoming overwhelming.\nDoctor: It sounds like your energy and motivation ebb and flow, shaping how heavy or manageable tasks feel. Have you noticed any fatigue or loss of energy that ties into those tougher days, making it harder to push through?\nPatient: Actually, my energy levels have been fairly steady, even on the tougher days. The shifts in motivation don\u2019t usually seem connected to feeling physically tired\u2014more like a mental or emotional pull that fluctuates independently. So, while some days are harder to get moving, it\u2019s not because my energy is depleted.\nDoctor: That\u2019s an important distinction\u2014your energy stays steady, but your motivation shifts more with how you feel mentally or emotionally. Can you tell me more about what kinds of thoughts or feelings tend to pull your motivation down on those tougher days?\nPatient: On tougher days, the dips in motivation often feel tied to a sense of futility or a lingering heaviness that hangs around emotionally. It\u2019s less about being physically worn out and more about this emotional weight that dulls my enthusiasm. There are deeper thoughts beneath that I\u2019m not quite ready to unpack fully yet, but they contribute to that pull. It\u2019s a slow undercurrent rather than a sudden wave.\nDoctor: That undercurrent you describe makes a lot of sense, and it\u2019s not uncommon for feelings like worthlessness or guilt to feed into that heaviness. Have you noticed any moments where you feel that way\u2014like blaming yourself or feeling less valuable? Feel free to share only what feels safe for you.\nPatient: Yes, there have been rare moments where I catch myself feeling a bit doubtful or less sure of my own worth. It\u2019s not something I dwell on regularly, but it does surface occasionally. I\u2019m still processing those moments, so I prefer to keep it brief for now.\nDoctor: Those moments of doubt can be tough to sit with, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take your time working through those feelings, no need to rush or go deeper until you\u2019re ready. I\u2019m here to support you whenever you choose to explore them further.\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate your understanding and patience. It does feel important to have that safe space to take things slowly. I\u2019m still working through those feelings at my own pace and hope to explore them more fully when the time feels right.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this space feels safe for you\u2014it\u2019s important. To understand how these emotional shifts might be affecting you overall, have you noticed any changes in your concentration or difficulty making decisions lately? Take your time with that\u2014there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really noticed any significant changes in my concentration or decision-making. Those aspects have stayed fairly steady.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know about your concentration and decision-making\u2014that\u2019s helpful. To get a full picture, have you experienced any changes in your movement or activity levels? For instance, feeling more restless, slowed down, or noticing shifts in how much physical energy or pace you have?\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed some changes in my activity levels. There are times when my movements feel slower, almost like I\u2019m moving through molasses, and other times when I feel a bit restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle. It varies but happens often enough to be noticeable.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to share those complex shifts in how you move and feel inside, so thank you for that openness. I appreciate your willingness to explore these experiences at a pace that feels right. I want you to know you\u2019re truly heard, and I\u2019m here to support you every step of the way.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nIt takes real courage to share those complex shifts in how you move and feel inside, so thank you for that openness.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. I guess I\u2019ve been feeling somewhat down at times, nothing constant but enough to notice. There are moments when things that usually interest me just don\u2019t hold the same appeal. It\u2019s been subtle but there. I\u2019m trying to make sense of it without getting too overwhelmed.\nDoctor: I hear that these feelings come and go, not constant but enough to catch your attention. How often would you say these down moments happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of your day-to-day activities or things you usually enjoy?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to pin down an exact frequency, but I\u2019d say those low moments pop up every few days. When they do, my usual interests might feel a bit muted, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get through the day or push myself to do things. It\u2019s more like a subtle weight that shifts the tone rather than something that completely stops me. So, manageable in that sense, though not without its frustrations.\nDoctor: That subtle weight you describe is important to notice. It\u2019s common for mood changes to also affect how our bodies respond, like appetite or weight. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my appetite or weight. Things have stayed pretty steady in that regard.\nDoctor: Good to hear your appetite and weight are steady. How about your sleep\u2014any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or changes in how well or long you\u2019re sleeping lately?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly okay for the most part. Occasionally, I might have a night where I wake up briefly or find it a bit harder to fall back asleep, but that\u2019s not a regular thing. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that your sleep\u2019s mostly stable. You mentioned those low moments earlier; would you say you\u2019ve been feeling down or low more persistently, or is it still mostly those occasional episodes? Understanding this helps me get a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s still mostly those occasional episodes. The down feelings are there and noticeable when they come, but they haven\u2019t really settled into something more constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more like a passing shadow than a heavy presence most days.\nDoctor: I appreciate your clarity\u2014it sounds like those down feelings come and go without taking over. You mentioned earlier having some thoughts about death; it\u2019s important to me that you feel safe talking about them. Have you been having any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have had some recurring thoughts about death, though they come and go rather than feeling constant or urgent.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Thanks for having me. I guess I\u2019ve been feeling somewhat down at times, nothing constant but enough to notice. There are moments when things that usually interest me just don\u2019t hold the same appeal. It\u2019s been subtle but there. I\u2019m trying to make sense of it without getting too overwhelmed.\nDoctor: I hear that these feelings come and go, not constant but enough to catch your attention. How often would you say these down moments happen? And when they do, how much do they get in the way of your day-to-day activities or things you usually enjoy?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to pin down an exact frequency, but I\u2019d say those low moments pop up every few days. When they do, my usual interests might feel a bit muted, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get through the day or push myself to do things. It\u2019s more like a subtle weight that shifts the tone rather than something that completely stops me. So, manageable in that sense, though not without its frustrations.\nDoctor: That subtle weight you describe is important to notice. It\u2019s common for mood changes to also affect how our bodies respond, like appetite or weight. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight, either eating more or less than usual?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my appetite or weight. Things have stayed pretty steady in that regard.\nDoctor: Good to hear your appetite and weight are steady. How about your sleep\u2014any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or changes in how well or long you\u2019re sleeping lately?\nPatient: Sleep has been mostly okay for the most part. Occasionally, I might have a night where I wake up briefly or find it a bit harder to fall back asleep, but that\u2019s not a regular thing. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been fairly stable.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that your sleep\u2019s mostly stable. You mentioned those low moments earlier; would you say you\u2019ve been feeling down or low more persistently, or is it still mostly those occasional episodes? Understanding this helps me get a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: I\u2019d say it\u2019s still mostly those occasional episodes. The down feelings are there and noticeable when they come, but they haven\u2019t really settled into something more constant or overwhelming. It\u2019s more like a passing shadow than a heavy presence most days.\nDoctor: I appreciate your clarity\u2014it sounds like those down feelings come and go without taking over. You mentioned earlier having some thoughts about death; it\u2019s important to me that you feel safe talking about them. Have you been having any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have had some recurring thoughts about death, though they come and go rather than feeling constant or urgent. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m fully comfortable sharing in detail just yet, but I want to be honest about their presence. They don\u2019t drive immediate distress, but I\u2019m aware of them.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open about those thoughts\u2014that takes courage. It\u2019s absolutely okay to share only what feels comfortable for you, and there\u2019s no rush. I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready, and your safety and comfort are what matter most in this space.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. Those thoughts about death are still present, but they don\u2019t overwhelm me at the moment. I think it\u2019ll take some time for me to feel comfortable opening up more fully, but I\u2019m willing to explore that gradually when I\u2019m ready. Thank you for being patient.\nDoctor: I really respect your courage in sharing what you have, and it\u2019s important to go at your own pace. Whenever you\u2019re ready to explore more, this is a safe space, and I\u2019m here to support you without pressure. We\u2019ll take it step by step, guided by what feels right for you.\nPatient: Thank you. It means a lot to have that kind of support and patience. Taking things slowly feels important right now, and I\u2019m grateful to have a space where I can do that. I\u2019m open to continuing these conversations as I feel ready.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this feels like a supportive space for you\u2014that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s meant to be. We\u2019ll keep this dialogue open and comfortable, always at your pace, with no pressure to share before you\u2019re ready. Your trust means a lot, and I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk.\nPatient: I really appreciate that, and the patience you\u2019ve shown. Knowing there\u2019s no pressure and that I can take my time makes it easier to stay open to these conversations. I\u2019m willing to keep moving forward gradually when it feels right.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear you\u2019re open to moving forward in a way that feels manageable for you. You mentioned before that some things you usually enjoy have lost a bit of their appeal\u2014can you tell me more about your current interest or pleasure in activities you normally like?\nPatient: I notice that some activities I used to really enjoy just don\u2019t have the same pull for me anymore. I still participate in them, mostly out of routine or a sense of obligation, but the enthusiasm isn\u2019t quite there. It\u2019s a clear loss of pleasure, though it hasn\u2019t completely shut down my engagement. It feels like things are a bit muted, not erased.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength by keeping up with activities even when the enjoyment feels muted. How do these changes in pleasure and motivation show up in your daily life and mood? Feel free to share whatever stands out to you about these shifts\u2014there\u2019s no rush here.\nPatient: Most days, I manage to keep up with what needs to be done, often more out of habit than genuine drive. The motivation isn\u2019t consistently there\u2014it comes and goes\u2014so some days feel heavier than others. This shift in my mood has a kind of dulling effect, like colors are less vibrant. It\u2019s noticeable but not completely overwhelming, just enough to make things feel a bit muted.\nDoctor: That dulling of colors you describe paints a clear picture\u2014it sounds like it shifts your experience in a way that\u2019s noticeable but not all-consuming. How do these ups and downs in motivation and mood impact your day-to-day functioning? Are there particular moments or tasks where it feels more challenging or easier?\nPatient: The ups and downs definitely affect how I approach my daily tasks. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m moving through things more out of routine than real interest, which can make tasks feel heavier or more taxing than usual. Other times, there are moments where things flow more easily, but those are less frequent. It\u2019s challenging at times, but I\u2019m still able to get by without things becoming overwhelming.\nDoctor: It sounds like your energy and motivation ebb and flow, shaping how heavy or manageable tasks feel. Have you noticed any fatigue or loss of energy that ties into those tougher days, making it harder to push through?\nPatient: Actually, my energy levels have been fairly steady, even on the tougher days. The shifts in motivation don\u2019t usually seem connected to feeling physically tired\u2014more like a mental or emotional pull that fluctuates independently. So, while some days are harder to get moving, it\u2019s not because my energy is depleted.\nDoctor: That\u2019s an important distinction\u2014your energy stays steady, but your motivation shifts more with how you feel mentally or emotionally. Can you tell me more about what kinds of thoughts or feelings tend to pull your motivation down on those tougher days?\nPatient: On tougher days, the dips in motivation often feel tied to a sense of futility or a lingering heaviness that hangs around emotionally. It\u2019s less about being physically worn out and more about this emotional weight that dulls my enthusiasm. There are deeper thoughts beneath that I\u2019m not quite ready to unpack fully yet, but they contribute to that pull. It\u2019s a slow undercurrent rather than a sudden wave.\nDoctor: That undercurrent you describe makes a lot of sense, and it\u2019s not uncommon for feelings like worthlessness or guilt to feed into that heaviness. Have you noticed any moments where you feel that way\u2014like blaming yourself or feeling less valuable? Feel free to share only what feels safe for you.\nPatient: Yes, there have been rare moments where I catch myself feeling a bit doubtful or less sure of my own worth. It\u2019s not something I dwell on regularly, but it does surface occasionally. I\u2019m still processing those moments, so I prefer to keep it brief for now.\nDoctor: Those moments of doubt can be tough to sit with, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take your time working through those feelings, no need to rush or go deeper until you\u2019re ready. I\u2019m here to support you whenever you choose to explore them further.\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate your understanding and patience. It does feel important to have that safe space to take things slowly. I\u2019m still working through those feelings at my own pace and hope to explore them more fully when the time feels right.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this space feels safe for you\u2014it\u2019s important. To understand how these emotional shifts might be affecting you overall, have you noticed any changes in your concentration or difficulty making decisions lately? Take your time with that\u2014there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really noticed any significant changes in my concentration or decision-making. Those aspects have stayed fairly steady.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know about your concentration and decision-making\u2014that\u2019s helpful. To get a full picture, have you experienced any changes in your movement or activity levels? For instance, feeling more restless, slowed down, or noticing shifts in how much physical energy or pace you have?\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed some changes in my activity levels. There are times when my movements feel slower, almost like I\u2019m moving through molasses, and other times when I feel a bit restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle. It varies but happens often enough to be noticeable.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to share those complex shifts in how you move and feel inside, so thank you for that openness. I appreciate your willingness to explore these experiences at a pace that feels right. I want you to know you\u2019re truly heard, and I\u2019m here to support you every step of the way.\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate your support and patience. It means a lot to feel heard in this process. I want to keep exploring these experiences but prefer to do so gradually and on my own terms.\nDoctor: Your openness and courage really stand out, and it\u2019s perfectly okay to move forward at your own speed. Know that I\u2019ll be here to support you whenever you\u2019re ready to dig deeper\u2014you're not alone in this.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nYour openness and courage really stand out, and it\u2019s perfectly okay to move forward at your own speed.

It\u2019s more like a passing shadow than a heavy presence most days.\nDoctor: I appreciate your clarity\u2014it sounds like those down feelings come and go without taking over. You mentioned earlier having some thoughts about death; it\u2019s important to me that you feel safe talking about them. Have you been having any recurring thoughts about death or suicide lately?\nPatient: Yes, I have had some recurring thoughts about death, though they come and go rather than feeling constant or urgent. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m fully comfortable sharing in detail just yet, but I want to be honest about their presence. They don\u2019t drive immediate distress, but I\u2019m aware of them.\nDoctor: Thank you for being open about those thoughts\u2014that takes courage. It\u2019s absolutely okay to share only what feels comfortable for you, and there\u2019s no rush. I\u2019m here to listen whenever you\u2019re ready, and your safety and comfort are what matter most in this space.\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. Those thoughts about death are still present, but they don\u2019t overwhelm me at the moment. I think it\u2019ll take some time for me to feel comfortable opening up more fully, but I\u2019m willing to explore that gradually when I\u2019m ready. Thank you for being patient.\nDoctor: I really respect your courage in sharing what you have, and it\u2019s important to go at your own pace. Whenever you\u2019re ready to explore more, this is a safe space, and I\u2019m here to support you without pressure. We\u2019ll take it step by step, guided by what feels right for you.\nPatient: Thank you. It means a lot to have that kind of support and patience. Taking things slowly feels important right now, and I\u2019m grateful to have a space where I can do that. I\u2019m open to continuing these conversations as I feel ready.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this feels like a supportive space for you\u2014that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s meant to be. We\u2019ll keep this dialogue open and comfortable, always at your pace, with no pressure to share before you\u2019re ready. Your trust means a lot, and I\u2019m here whenever you want to talk.\nPatient: I really appreciate that, and the patience you\u2019ve shown. Knowing there\u2019s no pressure and that I can take my time makes it easier to stay open to these conversations. I\u2019m willing to keep moving forward gradually when it feels right.\nDoctor: It\u2019s great to hear you\u2019re open to moving forward in a way that feels manageable for you. You mentioned before that some things you usually enjoy have lost a bit of their appeal\u2014can you tell me more about your current interest or pleasure in activities you normally like?\nPatient: I notice that some activities I used to really enjoy just don\u2019t have the same pull for me anymore. I still participate in them, mostly out of routine or a sense of obligation, but the enthusiasm isn\u2019t quite there. It\u2019s a clear loss of pleasure, though it hasn\u2019t completely shut down my engagement. It feels like things are a bit muted, not erased.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength by keeping up with activities even when the enjoyment feels muted. How do these changes in pleasure and motivation show up in your daily life and mood? Feel free to share whatever stands out to you about these shifts\u2014there\u2019s no rush here.\nPatient: Most days, I manage to keep up with what needs to be done, often more out of habit than genuine drive. The motivation isn\u2019t consistently there\u2014it comes and goes\u2014so some days feel heavier than others. This shift in my mood has a kind of dulling effect, like colors are less vibrant. It\u2019s noticeable but not completely overwhelming, just enough to make things feel a bit muted.\nDoctor: That dulling of colors you describe paints a clear picture\u2014it sounds like it shifts your experience in a way that\u2019s noticeable but not all-consuming. How do these ups and downs in motivation and mood impact your day-to-day functioning? Are there particular moments or tasks where it feels more challenging or easier?\nPatient: The ups and downs definitely affect how I approach my daily tasks. Some days, it feels like I\u2019m moving through things more out of routine than real interest, which can make tasks feel heavier or more taxing than usual. Other times, there are moments where things flow more easily, but those are less frequent. It\u2019s challenging at times, but I\u2019m still able to get by without things becoming overwhelming.\nDoctor: It sounds like your energy and motivation ebb and flow, shaping how heavy or manageable tasks feel. Have you noticed any fatigue or loss of energy that ties into those tougher days, making it harder to push through?\nPatient: Actually, my energy levels have been fairly steady, even on the tougher days. The shifts in motivation don\u2019t usually seem connected to feeling physically tired\u2014more like a mental or emotional pull that fluctuates independently. So, while some days are harder to get moving, it\u2019s not because my energy is depleted.\nDoctor: That\u2019s an important distinction\u2014your energy stays steady, but your motivation shifts more with how you feel mentally or emotionally. Can you tell me more about what kinds of thoughts or feelings tend to pull your motivation down on those tougher days?\nPatient: On tougher days, the dips in motivation often feel tied to a sense of futility or a lingering heaviness that hangs around emotionally. It\u2019s less about being physically worn out and more about this emotional weight that dulls my enthusiasm. There are deeper thoughts beneath that I\u2019m not quite ready to unpack fully yet, but they contribute to that pull. It\u2019s a slow undercurrent rather than a sudden wave.\nDoctor: That undercurrent you describe makes a lot of sense, and it\u2019s not uncommon for feelings like worthlessness or guilt to feed into that heaviness. Have you noticed any moments where you feel that way\u2014like blaming yourself or feeling less valuable? Feel free to share only what feels safe for you.\nPatient: Yes, there have been rare moments where I catch myself feeling a bit doubtful or less sure of my own worth. It\u2019s not something I dwell on regularly, but it does surface occasionally. I\u2019m still processing those moments, so I prefer to keep it brief for now.\nDoctor: Those moments of doubt can be tough to sit with, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It\u2019s absolutely okay to take your time working through those feelings, no need to rush or go deeper until you\u2019re ready. I\u2019m here to support you whenever you choose to explore them further.\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate your understanding and patience. It does feel important to have that safe space to take things slowly. I\u2019m still working through those feelings at my own pace and hope to explore them more fully when the time feels right.\nDoctor: I\u2019m glad this space feels safe for you\u2014it\u2019s important. To understand how these emotional shifts might be affecting you overall, have you noticed any changes in your concentration or difficulty making decisions lately? Take your time with that\u2014there\u2019s no rush.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t really noticed any significant changes in my concentration or decision-making. Those aspects have stayed fairly steady.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know about your concentration and decision-making\u2014that\u2019s helpful. To get a full picture, have you experienced any changes in your movement or activity levels? For instance, feeling more restless, slowed down, or noticing shifts in how much physical energy or pace you have?\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed some changes in my activity levels. There are times when my movements feel slower, almost like I\u2019m moving through molasses, and other times when I feel a bit restless, like I can\u2019t quite settle. It varies but happens often enough to be noticeable.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to share those complex shifts in how you move and feel inside, so thank you for that openness. I appreciate your willingness to explore these experiences at a pace that feels right. I want you to know you\u2019re truly heard, and I\u2019m here to support you every step of the way.\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate your support and patience. It means a lot to feel heard in this process. I want to keep exploring these experiences but prefer to do so gradually and on my own terms.\nDoctor: Your openness and courage really stand out, and it\u2019s perfectly okay to move forward at your own speed. Know that I\u2019ll be here to support you whenever you\u2019re ready to dig deeper\u2014you're not alone in this.\nPatient: I\u2019m grateful for your support and reassurance. Moving forward slowly feels right for me, and I value having this safe space. I\u2019ll share more when I feel comfortable to do so.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
