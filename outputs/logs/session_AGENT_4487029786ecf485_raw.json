Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories.

How often does this happen, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day? Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: The restless nights occur quite regularly, more often than not during the week. It\u2019s frustrating because I wake up several times, and it leaves me feeling tired the next day. My energy is definitely lower, but I still manage to keep up with my duties around the house and at work. I haven\u2019t found anything that clearly helps or worsens it yet\u2014just trying to stick to a routine as best as I can.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Linda\u2014waking up multiple times and still pushing through your days. How would you describe your energy levels overall?

It\u2019s tiring, yes, but nothing that stops me from doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: I see you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling drained, Linda\u2014that takes a lot. Does this low energy change how you feel emotionally, or affect whether you enjoy things you usually like? Tell me about that if you can.\nPatient: The low energy sometimes makes things more difficult, and I do notice it affecting me emotionally on occasion. I don\u2019t really lose interest in the things I usually do, though. Every now and then, I feel a bit guilty if I can\u2019t keep up perfectly, but I try not to let it get the better of me. My focus stays on doing what\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of guilt come and go, Linda. How often do they come up, and how strong would you say they are when they hit? Do these feelings affect your mood or make it harder to get through your day beyond just the tiredness?\nPatient: The feelings of guilt do come up fairly often, though they\u2019re usually manageable. When they do, they can lower my mood a bit, but I don\u2019t let them stop me from carrying out my responsibilities. I focus on what needs to be done, even when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I hear you, Linda\u2014you keep going even when guilt weighs on you, and that\u2019s important. When it comes to feeling worthless or having guilt that feels excessive, how often do those feelings come up, and how deeply do they affect you? Do they stick around most days, or come and go?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly frequently, but they\u2019re more like waves\u2014they come and go rather than staying all the time. They\u2019re uncomfortable, certainly, but not overwhelming. I do my best to keep my focus on the tasks I need to handle and not let those feelings take over.\nDoctor: When those waves hit, Linda, how long do they usually last?

But I\u2019m keeping up with the responsibilities at home and work.\nDoctor: Linda, it sounds like you\u2019re juggling a lot despite feeling tired. Can you tell me more about these restless nights? How often does this happen, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day? Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: The restless nights occur quite regularly, more often than not during the week. It\u2019s frustrating because I wake up several times, and it leaves me feeling tired the next day. My energy is definitely lower, but I still manage to keep up with my duties around the house and at work. I haven\u2019t found anything that clearly helps or worsens it yet\u2014just trying to stick to a routine as best as I can.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Linda\u2014waking up multiple times and still pushing through your days. How would you describe your energy levels overall? Is the tiredness just mild, or does it make simple tasks feel really tough to get through?\nPatient: My energy is definitely lower than it usually is, and I notice it throughout the day. But I\u2019m still managing to get through my responsibilities. It\u2019s tiring, yes, but nothing that stops me from doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: I see you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling drained, Linda\u2014that takes a lot. Does this low energy change how you feel emotionally, or affect whether you enjoy things you usually like? Tell me about that if you can.\nPatient: The low energy sometimes makes things more difficult, and I do notice it affecting me emotionally on occasion. I don\u2019t really lose interest in the things I usually do, though. Every now and then, I feel a bit guilty if I can\u2019t keep up perfectly, but I try not to let it get the better of me. My focus stays on doing what\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of guilt come and go, Linda. How often do they come up, and how strong would you say they are when they hit? Do these feelings affect your mood or make it harder to get through your day beyond just the tiredness?\nPatient: The feelings of guilt do come up fairly often, though they\u2019re usually manageable. When they do, they can lower my mood a bit, but I don\u2019t let them stop me from carrying out my responsibilities. I focus on what needs to be done, even when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I hear you, Linda\u2014you keep going even when guilt weighs on you, and that\u2019s important. When it comes to feeling worthless or having guilt that feels excessive, how often do those feelings come up, and how deeply do they affect you? Do they stick around most days, or come and go?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly frequently, but they\u2019re more like waves\u2014they come and go rather than staying all the time. They\u2019re uncomfortable, certainly, but not overwhelming. I do my best to keep my focus on the tasks I need to handle and not let those feelings take over.\nDoctor: When those waves hit, Linda, how long do they usually last? Have you noticed anything in particular that brings them on? And do they make it harder to keep up with your day or affect how you feel beyond just the guilt or worthlessness?\nPatient: When those feelings come, they usually last for a few hours, not the whole day. They tend to follow moments when I feel like I might\u2019ve fallen short or when things feel especially stressful. Even though they\u2019re uncomfortable, they don\u2019t really stop me from doing what I need to do. I focus on my duties and keep going, despite how I might feel.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength pushing through those tough moments, Linda.

But I\u2019m keeping up with the responsibilities at home and work.\nDoctor: Linda, it sounds like you\u2019re juggling a lot despite feeling tired. Can you tell me more about these restless nights? How often does this happen, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day? Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: The restless nights occur quite regularly, more often than not during the week. It\u2019s frustrating because I wake up several times, and it leaves me feeling tired the next day. My energy is definitely lower, but I still manage to keep up with my duties around the house and at work. I haven\u2019t found anything that clearly helps or worsens it yet\u2014just trying to stick to a routine as best as I can.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Linda\u2014waking up multiple times and still pushing through your days. How would you describe your energy levels overall? Is the tiredness just mild, or does it make simple tasks feel really tough to get through?\nPatient: My energy is definitely lower than it usually is, and I notice it throughout the day. But I\u2019m still managing to get through my responsibilities. It\u2019s tiring, yes, but nothing that stops me from doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: I see you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling drained, Linda\u2014that takes a lot. Does this low energy change how you feel emotionally, or affect whether you enjoy things you usually like? Tell me about that if you can.\nPatient: The low energy sometimes makes things more difficult, and I do notice it affecting me emotionally on occasion. I don\u2019t really lose interest in the things I usually do, though. Every now and then, I feel a bit guilty if I can\u2019t keep up perfectly, but I try not to let it get the better of me. My focus stays on doing what\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of guilt come and go, Linda. How often do they come up, and how strong would you say they are when they hit? Do these feelings affect your mood or make it harder to get through your day beyond just the tiredness?\nPatient: The feelings of guilt do come up fairly often, though they\u2019re usually manageable. When they do, they can lower my mood a bit, but I don\u2019t let them stop me from carrying out my responsibilities. I focus on what needs to be done, even when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I hear you, Linda\u2014you keep going even when guilt weighs on you, and that\u2019s important. When it comes to feeling worthless or having guilt that feels excessive, how often do those feelings come up, and how deeply do they affect you? Do they stick around most days, or come and go?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly frequently, but they\u2019re more like waves\u2014they come and go rather than staying all the time. They\u2019re uncomfortable, certainly, but not overwhelming. I do my best to keep my focus on the tasks I need to handle and not let those feelings take over.\nDoctor: When those waves hit, Linda, how long do they usually last? Have you noticed anything in particular that brings them on? And do they make it harder to keep up with your day or affect how you feel beyond just the guilt or worthlessness?\nPatient: When those feelings come, they usually last for a few hours, not the whole day. They tend to follow moments when I feel like I might\u2019ve fallen short or when things feel especially stressful. Even though they\u2019re uncomfortable, they don\u2019t really stop me from doing what I need to do. I focus on my duties and keep going, despite how I might feel.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength pushing through those tough moments, Linda. Let\u2019s shift a bit\u2014have you noticed any changes in your appetite or your weight lately, either up or down?\nPatient: Appetite changes have happened occasionally, but not often. When it does, it can make me feel a bit lower on energy, but it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t manage. I just try to keep up with my usual routine and responsibilities.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Linda.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hello. I\u2019ve been managing as usual. Sleep has been a bit restless some nights, which leaves me a little more tired through the day. But I\u2019m keeping up with the responsibilities at home and work.\nDoctor: Linda, it sounds like you\u2019re juggling a lot despite feeling tired. Can you tell me more about these restless nights? How often does this happen, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day? Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: The restless nights occur quite regularly, more often than not during the week. It\u2019s frustrating because I wake up several times, and it leaves me feeling tired the next day. My energy is definitely lower, but I still manage to keep up with my duties around the house and at work. I haven\u2019t found anything that clearly helps or worsens it yet\u2014just trying to stick to a routine as best as I can.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Linda\u2014waking up multiple times and still pushing through your days. How would you describe your energy levels overall? Is the tiredness just mild, or does it make simple tasks feel really tough to get through?\nPatient: My energy is definitely lower than it usually is, and I notice it throughout the day. But I\u2019m still managing to get through my responsibilities. It\u2019s tiring, yes, but nothing that stops me from doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: I see you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling drained, Linda\u2014that takes a lot. Does this low energy change how you feel emotionally, or affect whether you enjoy things you usually like? Tell me about that if you can.\nPatient: The low energy sometimes makes things more difficult, and I do notice it affecting me emotionally on occasion. I don\u2019t really lose interest in the things I usually do, though. Every now and then, I feel a bit guilty if I can\u2019t keep up perfectly, but I try not to let it get the better of me. My focus stays on doing what\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of guilt come and go, Linda. How often do they come up, and how strong would you say they are when they hit? Do these feelings affect your mood or make it harder to get through your day beyond just the tiredness?\nPatient: The feelings of guilt do come up fairly often, though they\u2019re usually manageable. When they do, they can lower my mood a bit, but I don\u2019t let them stop me from carrying out my responsibilities. I focus on what needs to be done, even when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I hear you, Linda\u2014you keep going even when guilt weighs on you, and that\u2019s important. When it comes to feeling worthless or having guilt that feels excessive, how often do those feelings come up, and how deeply do they affect you? Do they stick around most days, or come and go?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly frequently, but they\u2019re more like waves\u2014they come and go rather than staying all the time. They\u2019re uncomfortable, certainly, but not overwhelming. I do my best to keep my focus on the tasks I need to handle and not let those feelings take over.\nDoctor: When those waves hit, Linda, how long do they usually last? Have you noticed anything in particular that brings them on? And do they make it harder to keep up with your day or affect how you feel beyond just the guilt or worthlessness?\nPatient: When those feelings come, they usually last for a few hours, not the whole day. They tend to follow moments when I feel like I might\u2019ve fallen short or when things feel especially stressful. Even though they\u2019re uncomfortable, they don\u2019t really stop me from doing what I need to do. I focus on my duties and keep going, despite how I might feel.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength pushing through those tough moments, Linda. Let\u2019s shift a bit\u2014have you noticed any changes in your appetite or your weight lately, either up or down?\nPatient: Appetite changes have happened occasionally, but not often. When it does, it can make me feel a bit lower on energy, but it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t manage. I just try to keep up with my usual routine and responsibilities.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Linda. Have you been feeling sad, down, or depressed lately\u2014more than just the usual ups and downs?\nPatient: I do have moments where I feel down, but those are fairly rare and usually pass after a short time. I make a point to stick to my routine and keep up with what needs to be done, even when those feelings come up.\nDoctor: Linda, I really respect how aware you are of your feelings and the effort you put into keeping things steady. Sticking to a routine like that takes real determination, especially when your mood dips even briefly.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nLinda, I really respect how aware you are of your feelings and the effort you put into keeping things steady.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hello. I\u2019ve been managing as usual. Sleep has been a bit restless some nights, which leaves me a little more tired through the day. But I\u2019m keeping up with the responsibilities at home and work.\nDoctor: Linda, it sounds like you\u2019re juggling a lot despite feeling tired. Can you tell me more about these restless nights? How often does this happen, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day? Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: The restless nights occur quite regularly, more often than not during the week. It\u2019s frustrating because I wake up several times, and it leaves me feeling tired the next day. My energy is definitely lower, but I still manage to keep up with my duties around the house and at work. I haven\u2019t found anything that clearly helps or worsens it yet\u2014just trying to stick to a routine as best as I can.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Linda\u2014waking up multiple times and still pushing through your days. How would you describe your energy levels overall? Is the tiredness just mild, or does it make simple tasks feel really tough to get through?\nPatient: My energy is definitely lower than it usually is, and I notice it throughout the day. But I\u2019m still managing to get through my responsibilities. It\u2019s tiring, yes, but nothing that stops me from doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: I see you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling drained, Linda\u2014that takes a lot. Does this low energy change how you feel emotionally, or affect whether you enjoy things you usually like? Tell me about that if you can.\nPatient: The low energy sometimes makes things more difficult, and I do notice it affecting me emotionally on occasion. I don\u2019t really lose interest in the things I usually do, though. Every now and then, I feel a bit guilty if I can\u2019t keep up perfectly, but I try not to let it get the better of me. My focus stays on doing what\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of guilt come and go, Linda. How often do they come up, and how strong would you say they are when they hit? Do these feelings affect your mood or make it harder to get through your day beyond just the tiredness?\nPatient: The feelings of guilt do come up fairly often, though they\u2019re usually manageable. When they do, they can lower my mood a bit, but I don\u2019t let them stop me from carrying out my responsibilities. I focus on what needs to be done, even when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I hear you, Linda\u2014you keep going even when guilt weighs on you, and that\u2019s important. When it comes to feeling worthless or having guilt that feels excessive, how often do those feelings come up, and how deeply do they affect you? Do they stick around most days, or come and go?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly frequently, but they\u2019re more like waves\u2014they come and go rather than staying all the time. They\u2019re uncomfortable, certainly, but not overwhelming. I do my best to keep my focus on the tasks I need to handle and not let those feelings take over.\nDoctor: When those waves hit, Linda, how long do they usually last? Have you noticed anything in particular that brings them on? And do they make it harder to keep up with your day or affect how you feel beyond just the guilt or worthlessness?\nPatient: When those feelings come, they usually last for a few hours, not the whole day. They tend to follow moments when I feel like I might\u2019ve fallen short or when things feel especially stressful. Even though they\u2019re uncomfortable, they don\u2019t really stop me from doing what I need to do. I focus on my duties and keep going, despite how I might feel.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength pushing through those tough moments, Linda. Let\u2019s shift a bit\u2014have you noticed any changes in your appetite or your weight lately, either up or down?\nPatient: Appetite changes have happened occasionally, but not often. When it does, it can make me feel a bit lower on energy, but it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t manage. I just try to keep up with my usual routine and responsibilities.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Linda. Have you been feeling sad, down, or depressed lately\u2014more than just the usual ups and downs?\nPatient: I do have moments where I feel down, but those are fairly rare and usually pass after a short time. I make a point to stick to my routine and keep up with what needs to be done, even when those feelings come up.\nDoctor: Linda, I really respect how aware you are of your feelings and the effort you put into keeping things steady. Sticking to a routine like that takes real determination, especially when your mood dips even briefly.\nPatient: Thank you. Keeping a routine and focusing on my responsibilities feels essential\u2014it\u2019s what helps me stay grounded. The moments when my mood dips are brief, just challenges I work through, but I don\u2019t let them take over.\nDoctor: That sense of grounding you get from your routine and responsibilities, Linda, is a powerful tool. It\u2019s clear you work hard not to let those dips control you, which shows a lot of insight and strength. I appreciate you sharing that with me.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat sense of grounding you get from your routine and responsibilities, Linda, is a powerful tool.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hello. I\u2019ve been managing as usual. Sleep has been a bit restless some nights, which leaves me a little more tired through the day. But I\u2019m keeping up with the responsibilities at home and work.\nDoctor: Linda, it sounds like you\u2019re juggling a lot despite feeling tired. Can you tell me more about these restless nights? How often does this happen, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day? Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: The restless nights occur quite regularly, more often than not during the week. It\u2019s frustrating because I wake up several times, and it leaves me feeling tired the next day. My energy is definitely lower, but I still manage to keep up with my duties around the house and at work. I haven\u2019t found anything that clearly helps or worsens it yet\u2014just trying to stick to a routine as best as I can.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Linda\u2014waking up multiple times and still pushing through your days. How would you describe your energy levels overall? Is the tiredness just mild, or does it make simple tasks feel really tough to get through?\nPatient: My energy is definitely lower than it usually is, and I notice it throughout the day. But I\u2019m still managing to get through my responsibilities. It\u2019s tiring, yes, but nothing that stops me from doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: I see you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling drained, Linda\u2014that takes a lot. Does this low energy change how you feel emotionally, or affect whether you enjoy things you usually like? Tell me about that if you can.\nPatient: The low energy sometimes makes things more difficult, and I do notice it affecting me emotionally on occasion. I don\u2019t really lose interest in the things I usually do, though. Every now and then, I feel a bit guilty if I can\u2019t keep up perfectly, but I try not to let it get the better of me. My focus stays on doing what\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of guilt come and go, Linda. How often do they come up, and how strong would you say they are when they hit? Do these feelings affect your mood or make it harder to get through your day beyond just the tiredness?\nPatient: The feelings of guilt do come up fairly often, though they\u2019re usually manageable. When they do, they can lower my mood a bit, but I don\u2019t let them stop me from carrying out my responsibilities. I focus on what needs to be done, even when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I hear you, Linda\u2014you keep going even when guilt weighs on you, and that\u2019s important. When it comes to feeling worthless or having guilt that feels excessive, how often do those feelings come up, and how deeply do they affect you? Do they stick around most days, or come and go?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly frequently, but they\u2019re more like waves\u2014they come and go rather than staying all the time. They\u2019re uncomfortable, certainly, but not overwhelming. I do my best to keep my focus on the tasks I need to handle and not let those feelings take over.\nDoctor: When those waves hit, Linda, how long do they usually last? Have you noticed anything in particular that brings them on? And do they make it harder to keep up with your day or affect how you feel beyond just the guilt or worthlessness?\nPatient: When those feelings come, they usually last for a few hours, not the whole day. They tend to follow moments when I feel like I might\u2019ve fallen short or when things feel especially stressful. Even though they\u2019re uncomfortable, they don\u2019t really stop me from doing what I need to do. I focus on my duties and keep going, despite how I might feel.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength pushing through those tough moments, Linda. Let\u2019s shift a bit\u2014have you noticed any changes in your appetite or your weight lately, either up or down?\nPatient: Appetite changes have happened occasionally, but not often. When it does, it can make me feel a bit lower on energy, but it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t manage. I just try to keep up with my usual routine and responsibilities.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Linda. Have you been feeling sad, down, or depressed lately\u2014more than just the usual ups and downs?\nPatient: I do have moments where I feel down, but those are fairly rare and usually pass after a short time. I make a point to stick to my routine and keep up with what needs to be done, even when those feelings come up.\nDoctor: Linda, I really respect how aware you are of your feelings and the effort you put into keeping things steady. Sticking to a routine like that takes real determination, especially when your mood dips even briefly.\nPatient: Thank you. Keeping a routine and focusing on my responsibilities feels essential\u2014it\u2019s what helps me stay grounded. The moments when my mood dips are brief, just challenges I work through, but I don\u2019t let them take over.\nDoctor: That sense of grounding you get from your routine and responsibilities, Linda, is a powerful tool. It\u2019s clear you work hard not to let those dips control you, which shows a lot of insight and strength. I appreciate you sharing that with me.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Staying focused on my routine and responsibilities really helps me keep things in order. It\u2019s not always easy, but it\u2019s important to me to manage as best I can.\nDoctor: Linda, your dedication to keeping a steady routine and handling your responsibilities is clearly a cornerstone of your strength.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hello. I\u2019ve been managing as usual. Sleep has been a bit restless some nights, which leaves me a little more tired through the day. But I\u2019m keeping up with the responsibilities at home and work.\nDoctor: Linda, it sounds like you\u2019re juggling a lot despite feeling tired. Can you tell me more about these restless nights? How often does this happen, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day? Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: The restless nights occur quite regularly, more often than not during the week. It\u2019s frustrating because I wake up several times, and it leaves me feeling tired the next day. My energy is definitely lower, but I still manage to keep up with my duties around the house and at work. I haven\u2019t found anything that clearly helps or worsens it yet\u2014just trying to stick to a routine as best as I can.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Linda\u2014waking up multiple times and still pushing through your days. How would you describe your energy levels overall? Is the tiredness just mild, or does it make simple tasks feel really tough to get through?\nPatient: My energy is definitely lower than it usually is, and I notice it throughout the day. But I\u2019m still managing to get through my responsibilities. It\u2019s tiring, yes, but nothing that stops me from doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: I see you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling drained, Linda\u2014that takes a lot. Does this low energy change how you feel emotionally, or affect whether you enjoy things you usually like? Tell me about that if you can.\nPatient: The low energy sometimes makes things more difficult, and I do notice it affecting me emotionally on occasion. I don\u2019t really lose interest in the things I usually do, though. Every now and then, I feel a bit guilty if I can\u2019t keep up perfectly, but I try not to let it get the better of me. My focus stays on doing what\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of guilt come and go, Linda. How often do they come up, and how strong would you say they are when they hit? Do these feelings affect your mood or make it harder to get through your day beyond just the tiredness?\nPatient: The feelings of guilt do come up fairly often, though they\u2019re usually manageable. When they do, they can lower my mood a bit, but I don\u2019t let them stop me from carrying out my responsibilities. I focus on what needs to be done, even when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I hear you, Linda\u2014you keep going even when guilt weighs on you, and that\u2019s important. When it comes to feeling worthless or having guilt that feels excessive, how often do those feelings come up, and how deeply do they affect you? Do they stick around most days, or come and go?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly frequently, but they\u2019re more like waves\u2014they come and go rather than staying all the time. They\u2019re uncomfortable, certainly, but not overwhelming. I do my best to keep my focus on the tasks I need to handle and not let those feelings take over.\nDoctor: When those waves hit, Linda, how long do they usually last? Have you noticed anything in particular that brings them on? And do they make it harder to keep up with your day or affect how you feel beyond just the guilt or worthlessness?\nPatient: When those feelings come, they usually last for a few hours, not the whole day. They tend to follow moments when I feel like I might\u2019ve fallen short or when things feel especially stressful. Even though they\u2019re uncomfortable, they don\u2019t really stop me from doing what I need to do. I focus on my duties and keep going, despite how I might feel.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength pushing through those tough moments, Linda. Let\u2019s shift a bit\u2014have you noticed any changes in your appetite or your weight lately, either up or down?\nPatient: Appetite changes have happened occasionally, but not often. When it does, it can make me feel a bit lower on energy, but it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t manage. I just try to keep up with my usual routine and responsibilities.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Linda. Have you been feeling sad, down, or depressed lately\u2014more than just the usual ups and downs?\nPatient: I do have moments where I feel down, but those are fairly rare and usually pass after a short time. I make a point to stick to my routine and keep up with what needs to be done, even when those feelings come up.\nDoctor: Linda, I really respect how aware you are of your feelings and the effort you put into keeping things steady. Sticking to a routine like that takes real determination, especially when your mood dips even briefly.\nPatient: Thank you. Keeping a routine and focusing on my responsibilities feels essential\u2014it\u2019s what helps me stay grounded. The moments when my mood dips are brief, just challenges I work through, but I don\u2019t let them take over.\nDoctor: That sense of grounding you get from your routine and responsibilities, Linda, is a powerful tool. It\u2019s clear you work hard not to let those dips control you, which shows a lot of insight and strength. I appreciate you sharing that with me.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Staying focused on my routine and responsibilities really helps me keep things in order. It\u2019s not always easy, but it\u2019s important to me to manage as best I can.\nDoctor: Linda, your dedication to keeping a steady routine and handling your responsibilities is clearly a cornerstone of your strength. It\u2019s not a small thing to keep that balance, especially when it feels tough. What helps you the most to maintain this focus and keep going when it gets challenging?\nPatient: What helps most is my sense of duty\u2014I feel responsible for my family and my role. I rely on my internal discipline and routines to stay on track. It can be difficult at times, especially when fatigue or guilt comes up, but I know this is what needs to be done, so I keep going.\nDoctor: Your sense of duty and discipline clearly carry a lot of weight for you, Linda, and help you push through. With that in mind, have you noticed any loss of interest or pleasure in activities you normally enjoy, or do you still find some satisfaction in them?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nYour sense of duty and discipline clearly carry a lot of weight for you, Linda, and help you push through.

Sleep has been a bit restless some nights, which leaves me a little more tired through the day. But I\u2019m keeping up with the responsibilities at home and work.\nDoctor: Linda, it sounds like you\u2019re juggling a lot despite feeling tired. Can you tell me more about these restless nights? How often does this happen, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day? Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: The restless nights occur quite regularly, more often than not during the week. It\u2019s frustrating because I wake up several times, and it leaves me feeling tired the next day. My energy is definitely lower, but I still manage to keep up with my duties around the house and at work. I haven\u2019t found anything that clearly helps or worsens it yet\u2014just trying to stick to a routine as best as I can.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Linda\u2014waking up multiple times and still pushing through your days. How would you describe your energy levels overall? Is the tiredness just mild, or does it make simple tasks feel really tough to get through?\nPatient: My energy is definitely lower than it usually is, and I notice it throughout the day. But I\u2019m still managing to get through my responsibilities. It\u2019s tiring, yes, but nothing that stops me from doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: I see you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling drained, Linda\u2014that takes a lot. Does this low energy change how you feel emotionally, or affect whether you enjoy things you usually like? Tell me about that if you can.\nPatient: The low energy sometimes makes things more difficult, and I do notice it affecting me emotionally on occasion. I don\u2019t really lose interest in the things I usually do, though. Every now and then, I feel a bit guilty if I can\u2019t keep up perfectly, but I try not to let it get the better of me. My focus stays on doing what\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of guilt come and go, Linda. How often do they come up, and how strong would you say they are when they hit? Do these feelings affect your mood or make it harder to get through your day beyond just the tiredness?\nPatient: The feelings of guilt do come up fairly often, though they\u2019re usually manageable. When they do, they can lower my mood a bit, but I don\u2019t let them stop me from carrying out my responsibilities. I focus on what needs to be done, even when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I hear you, Linda\u2014you keep going even when guilt weighs on you, and that\u2019s important. When it comes to feeling worthless or having guilt that feels excessive, how often do those feelings come up, and how deeply do they affect you? Do they stick around most days, or come and go?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly frequently, but they\u2019re more like waves\u2014they come and go rather than staying all the time. They\u2019re uncomfortable, certainly, but not overwhelming. I do my best to keep my focus on the tasks I need to handle and not let those feelings take over.\nDoctor: When those waves hit, Linda, how long do they usually last? Have you noticed anything in particular that brings them on? And do they make it harder to keep up with your day or affect how you feel beyond just the guilt or worthlessness?\nPatient: When those feelings come, they usually last for a few hours, not the whole day. They tend to follow moments when I feel like I might\u2019ve fallen short or when things feel especially stressful. Even though they\u2019re uncomfortable, they don\u2019t really stop me from doing what I need to do. I focus on my duties and keep going, despite how I might feel.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength pushing through those tough moments, Linda. Let\u2019s shift a bit\u2014have you noticed any changes in your appetite or your weight lately, either up or down?\nPatient: Appetite changes have happened occasionally, but not often. When it does, it can make me feel a bit lower on energy, but it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t manage. I just try to keep up with my usual routine and responsibilities.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Linda. Have you been feeling sad, down, or depressed lately\u2014more than just the usual ups and downs?\nPatient: I do have moments where I feel down, but those are fairly rare and usually pass after a short time. I make a point to stick to my routine and keep up with what needs to be done, even when those feelings come up.\nDoctor: Linda, I really respect how aware you are of your feelings and the effort you put into keeping things steady. Sticking to a routine like that takes real determination, especially when your mood dips even briefly.\nPatient: Thank you. Keeping a routine and focusing on my responsibilities feels essential\u2014it\u2019s what helps me stay grounded. The moments when my mood dips are brief, just challenges I work through, but I don\u2019t let them take over.\nDoctor: That sense of grounding you get from your routine and responsibilities, Linda, is a powerful tool. It\u2019s clear you work hard not to let those dips control you, which shows a lot of insight and strength. I appreciate you sharing that with me.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Staying focused on my routine and responsibilities really helps me keep things in order. It\u2019s not always easy, but it\u2019s important to me to manage as best I can.\nDoctor: Linda, your dedication to keeping a steady routine and handling your responsibilities is clearly a cornerstone of your strength. It\u2019s not a small thing to keep that balance, especially when it feels tough. What helps you the most to maintain this focus and keep going when it gets challenging?\nPatient: What helps most is my sense of duty\u2014I feel responsible for my family and my role. I rely on my internal discipline and routines to stay on track. It can be difficult at times, especially when fatigue or guilt comes up, but I know this is what needs to be done, so I keep going.\nDoctor: Your sense of duty and discipline clearly carry a lot of weight for you, Linda, and help you push through. With that in mind, have you noticed any loss of interest or pleasure in activities you normally enjoy, or do you still find some satisfaction in them?\nPatient: I still find satisfaction in the activities I usually do. My interest hasn\u2019t really changed much. Staying focused on my responsibilities helps me keep engaged, even when things are challenging.\nDoctor: Now that we\u2019ve covered how you\u2019re feeling and staying engaged, Linda, have you noticed any changes with your concentration or making decisions recently? Does it feel harder to focus or decide things like it used to?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nNow that we\u2019ve covered how you\u2019re feeling and staying engaged, Linda, have you noticed any changes with your concentration or making decisions recently?

But I\u2019m keeping up with the responsibilities at home and work.\nDoctor: Linda, it sounds like you\u2019re juggling a lot despite feeling tired. Can you tell me more about these restless nights? How often does this happen, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day? Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: The restless nights occur quite regularly, more often than not during the week. It\u2019s frustrating because I wake up several times, and it leaves me feeling tired the next day. My energy is definitely lower, but I still manage to keep up with my duties around the house and at work. I haven\u2019t found anything that clearly helps or worsens it yet\u2014just trying to stick to a routine as best as I can.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Linda\u2014waking up multiple times and still pushing through your days. How would you describe your energy levels overall? Is the tiredness just mild, or does it make simple tasks feel really tough to get through?\nPatient: My energy is definitely lower than it usually is, and I notice it throughout the day. But I\u2019m still managing to get through my responsibilities. It\u2019s tiring, yes, but nothing that stops me from doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: I see you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling drained, Linda\u2014that takes a lot. Does this low energy change how you feel emotionally, or affect whether you enjoy things you usually like? Tell me about that if you can.\nPatient: The low energy sometimes makes things more difficult, and I do notice it affecting me emotionally on occasion. I don\u2019t really lose interest in the things I usually do, though. Every now and then, I feel a bit guilty if I can\u2019t keep up perfectly, but I try not to let it get the better of me. My focus stays on doing what\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of guilt come and go, Linda. How often do they come up, and how strong would you say they are when they hit? Do these feelings affect your mood or make it harder to get through your day beyond just the tiredness?\nPatient: The feelings of guilt do come up fairly often, though they\u2019re usually manageable. When they do, they can lower my mood a bit, but I don\u2019t let them stop me from carrying out my responsibilities. I focus on what needs to be done, even when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I hear you, Linda\u2014you keep going even when guilt weighs on you, and that\u2019s important. When it comes to feeling worthless or having guilt that feels excessive, how often do those feelings come up, and how deeply do they affect you? Do they stick around most days, or come and go?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly frequently, but they\u2019re more like waves\u2014they come and go rather than staying all the time. They\u2019re uncomfortable, certainly, but not overwhelming. I do my best to keep my focus on the tasks I need to handle and not let those feelings take over.\nDoctor: When those waves hit, Linda, how long do they usually last? Have you noticed anything in particular that brings them on? And do they make it harder to keep up with your day or affect how you feel beyond just the guilt or worthlessness?\nPatient: When those feelings come, they usually last for a few hours, not the whole day. They tend to follow moments when I feel like I might\u2019ve fallen short or when things feel especially stressful. Even though they\u2019re uncomfortable, they don\u2019t really stop me from doing what I need to do. I focus on my duties and keep going, despite how I might feel.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength pushing through those tough moments, Linda. Let\u2019s shift a bit\u2014have you noticed any changes in your appetite or your weight lately, either up or down?\nPatient: Appetite changes have happened occasionally, but not often. When it does, it can make me feel a bit lower on energy, but it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t manage. I just try to keep up with my usual routine and responsibilities.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Linda. Have you been feeling sad, down, or depressed lately\u2014more than just the usual ups and downs?\nPatient: I do have moments where I feel down, but those are fairly rare and usually pass after a short time. I make a point to stick to my routine and keep up with what needs to be done, even when those feelings come up.\nDoctor: Linda, I really respect how aware you are of your feelings and the effort you put into keeping things steady. Sticking to a routine like that takes real determination, especially when your mood dips even briefly.\nPatient: Thank you. Keeping a routine and focusing on my responsibilities feels essential\u2014it\u2019s what helps me stay grounded. The moments when my mood dips are brief, just challenges I work through, but I don\u2019t let them take over.\nDoctor: That sense of grounding you get from your routine and responsibilities, Linda, is a powerful tool. It\u2019s clear you work hard not to let those dips control you, which shows a lot of insight and strength. I appreciate you sharing that with me.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Staying focused on my routine and responsibilities really helps me keep things in order. It\u2019s not always easy, but it\u2019s important to me to manage as best I can.\nDoctor: Linda, your dedication to keeping a steady routine and handling your responsibilities is clearly a cornerstone of your strength. It\u2019s not a small thing to keep that balance, especially when it feels tough. What helps you the most to maintain this focus and keep going when it gets challenging?\nPatient: What helps most is my sense of duty\u2014I feel responsible for my family and my role. I rely on my internal discipline and routines to stay on track. It can be difficult at times, especially when fatigue or guilt comes up, but I know this is what needs to be done, so I keep going.\nDoctor: Your sense of duty and discipline clearly carry a lot of weight for you, Linda, and help you push through.

I do my best to keep my focus on the tasks I need to handle and not let those feelings take over.\nDoctor: When those waves hit, Linda, how long do they usually last? Have you noticed anything in particular that brings them on? And do they make it harder to keep up with your day or affect how you feel beyond just the guilt or worthlessness?\nPatient: When those feelings come, they usually last for a few hours, not the whole day. They tend to follow moments when I feel like I might\u2019ve fallen short or when things feel especially stressful. Even though they\u2019re uncomfortable, they don\u2019t really stop me from doing what I need to do. I focus on my duties and keep going, despite how I might feel.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength pushing through those tough moments, Linda. Let\u2019s shift a bit\u2014have you noticed any changes in your appetite or your weight lately, either up or down?\nPatient: Appetite changes have happened occasionally, but not often. When it does, it can make me feel a bit lower on energy, but it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t manage. I just try to keep up with my usual routine and responsibilities.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Linda. Have you been feeling sad, down, or depressed lately\u2014more than just the usual ups and downs?\nPatient: I do have moments where I feel down, but those are fairly rare and usually pass after a short time. I make a point to stick to my routine and keep up with what needs to be done, even when those feelings come up.\nDoctor: Linda, I really respect how aware you are of your feelings and the effort you put into keeping things steady. Sticking to a routine like that takes real determination, especially when your mood dips even briefly.\nPatient: Thank you. Keeping a routine and focusing on my responsibilities feels essential\u2014it\u2019s what helps me stay grounded. The moments when my mood dips are brief, just challenges I work through, but I don\u2019t let them take over.\nDoctor: That sense of grounding you get from your routine and responsibilities, Linda, is a powerful tool. It\u2019s clear you work hard not to let those dips control you, which shows a lot of insight and strength. I appreciate you sharing that with me.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Staying focused on my routine and responsibilities really helps me keep things in order. It\u2019s not always easy, but it\u2019s important to me to manage as best I can.\nDoctor: Linda, your dedication to keeping a steady routine and handling your responsibilities is clearly a cornerstone of your strength. It\u2019s not a small thing to keep that balance, especially when it feels tough. What helps you the most to maintain this focus and keep going when it gets challenging?\nPatient: What helps most is my sense of duty\u2014I feel responsible for my family and my role. I rely on my internal discipline and routines to stay on track. It can be difficult at times, especially when fatigue or guilt comes up, but I know this is what needs to be done, so I keep going.\nDoctor: Your sense of duty and discipline clearly carry a lot of weight for you, Linda, and help you push through. With that in mind, have you noticed any loss of interest or pleasure in activities you normally enjoy, or do you still find some satisfaction in them?\nPatient: I still find satisfaction in the activities I usually do. My interest hasn\u2019t really changed much. Staying focused on my responsibilities helps me keep engaged, even when things are challenging.\nDoctor: Now that we\u2019ve covered how you\u2019re feeling and staying engaged, Linda, have you noticed any changes with your concentration or making decisions recently? Does it feel harder to focus or decide things like it used to?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes with my concentration or decision-making. Even with the fatigue and occasional feelings of guilt, I\u2019m able to stay focused on what needs to be done and manage steady as usual.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying, Linda. Going back to your sleep, have you noticed any problems with falling asleep, staying asleep through the night, or waking up earlier than you\u2019d like?\nPatient: I generally fall asleep without much trouble, but I do have difficulty staying asleep through the night.

Sleep has been a bit restless some nights, which leaves me a little more tired through the day. But I\u2019m keeping up with the responsibilities at home and work.\nDoctor: Linda, it sounds like you\u2019re juggling a lot despite feeling tired. Can you tell me more about these restless nights? How often does this happen, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day? Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: The restless nights occur quite regularly, more often than not during the week. It\u2019s frustrating because I wake up several times, and it leaves me feeling tired the next day. My energy is definitely lower, but I still manage to keep up with my duties around the house and at work. I haven\u2019t found anything that clearly helps or worsens it yet\u2014just trying to stick to a routine as best as I can.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Linda\u2014waking up multiple times and still pushing through your days. How would you describe your energy levels overall? Is the tiredness just mild, or does it make simple tasks feel really tough to get through?\nPatient: My energy is definitely lower than it usually is, and I notice it throughout the day. But I\u2019m still managing to get through my responsibilities. It\u2019s tiring, yes, but nothing that stops me from doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: I see you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling drained, Linda\u2014that takes a lot. Does this low energy change how you feel emotionally, or affect whether you enjoy things you usually like? Tell me about that if you can.\nPatient: The low energy sometimes makes things more difficult, and I do notice it affecting me emotionally on occasion. I don\u2019t really lose interest in the things I usually do, though. Every now and then, I feel a bit guilty if I can\u2019t keep up perfectly, but I try not to let it get the better of me. My focus stays on doing what\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of guilt come and go, Linda. How often do they come up, and how strong would you say they are when they hit? Do these feelings affect your mood or make it harder to get through your day beyond just the tiredness?\nPatient: The feelings of guilt do come up fairly often, though they\u2019re usually manageable. When they do, they can lower my mood a bit, but I don\u2019t let them stop me from carrying out my responsibilities. I focus on what needs to be done, even when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I hear you, Linda\u2014you keep going even when guilt weighs on you, and that\u2019s important. When it comes to feeling worthless or having guilt that feels excessive, how often do those feelings come up, and how deeply do they affect you? Do they stick around most days, or come and go?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly frequently, but they\u2019re more like waves\u2014they come and go rather than staying all the time. They\u2019re uncomfortable, certainly, but not overwhelming. I do my best to keep my focus on the tasks I need to handle and not let those feelings take over.\nDoctor: When those waves hit, Linda, how long do they usually last?

Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hello. I\u2019ve been managing as usual. Sleep has been a bit restless some nights, which leaves me a little more tired through the day. But I\u2019m keeping up with the responsibilities at home and work.\nDoctor: Linda, it sounds like you\u2019re juggling a lot despite feeling tired. Can you tell me more about these restless nights? How often does this happen, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day? Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: The restless nights occur quite regularly, more often than not during the week. It\u2019s frustrating because I wake up several times, and it leaves me feeling tired the next day. My energy is definitely lower, but I still manage to keep up with my duties around the house and at work. I haven\u2019t found anything that clearly helps or worsens it yet\u2014just trying to stick to a routine as best as I can.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Linda\u2014waking up multiple times and still pushing through your days. How would you describe your energy levels overall? Is the tiredness just mild, or does it make simple tasks feel really tough to get through?\nPatient: My energy is definitely lower than it usually is, and I notice it throughout the day. But I\u2019m still managing to get through my responsibilities. It\u2019s tiring, yes, but nothing that stops me from doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: I see you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling drained, Linda\u2014that takes a lot. Does this low energy change how you feel emotionally, or affect whether you enjoy things you usually like? Tell me about that if you can.\nPatient: The low energy sometimes makes things more difficult, and I do notice it affecting me emotionally on occasion. I don\u2019t really lose interest in the things I usually do, though. Every now and then, I feel a bit guilty if I can\u2019t keep up perfectly, but I try not to let it get the better of me. My focus stays on doing what\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of guilt come and go, Linda. How often do they come up, and how strong would you say they are when they hit? Do these feelings affect your mood or make it harder to get through your day beyond just the tiredness?\nPatient: The feelings of guilt do come up fairly often, though they\u2019re usually manageable. When they do, they can lower my mood a bit, but I don\u2019t let them stop me from carrying out my responsibilities. I focus on what needs to be done, even when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I hear you, Linda\u2014you keep going even when guilt weighs on you, and that\u2019s important. When it comes to feeling worthless or having guilt that feels excessive, how often do those feelings come up, and how deeply do they affect you? Do they stick around most days, or come and go?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly frequently, but they\u2019re more like waves\u2014they come and go rather than staying all the time. They\u2019re uncomfortable, certainly, but not overwhelming. I do my best to keep my focus on the tasks I need to handle and not let those feelings take over.\nDoctor: When those waves hit, Linda, how long do they usually last? Have you noticed anything in particular that brings them on? And do they make it harder to keep up with your day or affect how you feel beyond just the guilt or worthlessness?\nPatient: When those feelings come, they usually last for a few hours, not the whole day. They tend to follow moments when I feel like I might\u2019ve fallen short or when things feel especially stressful. Even though they\u2019re uncomfortable, they don\u2019t really stop me from doing what I need to do. I focus on my duties and keep going, despite how I might feel.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength pushing through those tough moments, Linda. Let\u2019s shift a bit\u2014have you noticed any changes in your appetite or your weight lately, either up or down?\nPatient: Appetite changes have happened occasionally, but not often. When it does, it can make me feel a bit lower on energy, but it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t manage. I just try to keep up with my usual routine and responsibilities.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Linda. Have you been feeling sad, down, or depressed lately\u2014more than just the usual ups and downs?\nPatient: I do have moments where I feel down, but those are fairly rare and usually pass after a short time. I make a point to stick to my routine and keep up with what needs to be done, even when those feelings come up.\nDoctor: Linda, I really respect how aware you are of your feelings and the effort you put into keeping things steady. Sticking to a routine like that takes real determination, especially when your mood dips even briefly.\nPatient: Thank you. Keeping a routine and focusing on my responsibilities feels essential\u2014it\u2019s what helps me stay grounded. The moments when my mood dips are brief, just challenges I work through, but I don\u2019t let them take over.\nDoctor: That sense of grounding you get from your routine and responsibilities, Linda, is a powerful tool. It\u2019s clear you work hard not to let those dips control you, which shows a lot of insight and strength. I appreciate you sharing that with me.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Staying focused on my routine and responsibilities really helps me keep things in order. It\u2019s not always easy, but it\u2019s important to me to manage as best I can.\nDoctor: Linda, your dedication to keeping a steady routine and handling your responsibilities is clearly a cornerstone of your strength. It\u2019s not a small thing to keep that balance, especially when it feels tough. What helps you the most to maintain this focus and keep going when it gets challenging?\nPatient: What helps most is my sense of duty\u2014I feel responsible for my family and my role. I rely on my internal discipline and routines to stay on track. It can be difficult at times, especially when fatigue or guilt comes up, but I know this is what needs to be done, so I keep going.\nDoctor: Your sense of duty and discipline clearly carry a lot of weight for you, Linda, and help you push through. With that in mind, have you noticed any loss of interest or pleasure in activities you normally enjoy, or do you still find some satisfaction in them?\nPatient: I still find satisfaction in the activities I usually do. My interest hasn\u2019t really changed much. Staying focused on my responsibilities helps me keep engaged, even when things are challenging.\nDoctor: Now that we\u2019ve covered how you\u2019re feeling and staying engaged, Linda, have you noticed any changes with your concentration or making decisions recently? Does it feel harder to focus or decide things like it used to?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes with my concentration or decision-making. Even with the fatigue and occasional feelings of guilt, I\u2019m able to stay focused on what needs to be done and manage steady as usual.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying, Linda. Going back to your sleep, have you noticed any problems with falling asleep, staying asleep through the night, or waking up earlier than you\u2019d like?\nPatient: I generally fall asleep without much trouble, but I do have difficulty staying asleep through the night. I often wake up several times, and sometimes I wake earlier than I would like. Despite that, I\u2019m doing my best to keep my routine going.\nDoctor: Linda, I can see you\u2019re really committed to your routine despite the sleep interruptions. How do these frequent awakenings and early mornings affect your mood and energy during the day? Have you noticed any patterns or things that might trigger these restless nights?\nPatient: The frequent awakenings and early mornings definitely make me more tired during the day\u2014it can be draining at times. I\u2019ve thought about what might be causing it, but I haven\u2019t found any clear pattern or trigger.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hello. I\u2019ve been managing as usual. Sleep has been a bit restless some nights, which leaves me a little more tired through the day. But I\u2019m keeping up with the responsibilities at home and work.\nDoctor: Linda, it sounds like you\u2019re juggling a lot despite feeling tired. Can you tell me more about these restless nights? How often does this happen, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day? Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: The restless nights occur quite regularly, more often than not during the week. It\u2019s frustrating because I wake up several times, and it leaves me feeling tired the next day. My energy is definitely lower, but I still manage to keep up with my duties around the house and at work. I haven\u2019t found anything that clearly helps or worsens it yet\u2014just trying to stick to a routine as best as I can.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Linda\u2014waking up multiple times and still pushing through your days. How would you describe your energy levels overall? Is the tiredness just mild, or does it make simple tasks feel really tough to get through?\nPatient: My energy is definitely lower than it usually is, and I notice it throughout the day. But I\u2019m still managing to get through my responsibilities. It\u2019s tiring, yes, but nothing that stops me from doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: I see you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling drained, Linda\u2014that takes a lot. Does this low energy change how you feel emotionally, or affect whether you enjoy things you usually like? Tell me about that if you can.\nPatient: The low energy sometimes makes things more difficult, and I do notice it affecting me emotionally on occasion. I don\u2019t really lose interest in the things I usually do, though. Every now and then, I feel a bit guilty if I can\u2019t keep up perfectly, but I try not to let it get the better of me. My focus stays on doing what\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of guilt come and go, Linda. How often do they come up, and how strong would you say they are when they hit? Do these feelings affect your mood or make it harder to get through your day beyond just the tiredness?\nPatient: The feelings of guilt do come up fairly often, though they\u2019re usually manageable. When they do, they can lower my mood a bit, but I don\u2019t let them stop me from carrying out my responsibilities. I focus on what needs to be done, even when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I hear you, Linda\u2014you keep going even when guilt weighs on you, and that\u2019s important. When it comes to feeling worthless or having guilt that feels excessive, how often do those feelings come up, and how deeply do they affect you? Do they stick around most days, or come and go?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly frequently, but they\u2019re more like waves\u2014they come and go rather than staying all the time. They\u2019re uncomfortable, certainly, but not overwhelming. I do my best to keep my focus on the tasks I need to handle and not let those feelings take over.\nDoctor: When those waves hit, Linda, how long do they usually last? Have you noticed anything in particular that brings them on? And do they make it harder to keep up with your day or affect how you feel beyond just the guilt or worthlessness?\nPatient: When those feelings come, they usually last for a few hours, not the whole day. They tend to follow moments when I feel like I might\u2019ve fallen short or when things feel especially stressful. Even though they\u2019re uncomfortable, they don\u2019t really stop me from doing what I need to do. I focus on my duties and keep going, despite how I might feel.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength pushing through those tough moments, Linda. Let\u2019s shift a bit\u2014have you noticed any changes in your appetite or your weight lately, either up or down?\nPatient: Appetite changes have happened occasionally, but not often. When it does, it can make me feel a bit lower on energy, but it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t manage. I just try to keep up with my usual routine and responsibilities.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Linda. Have you been feeling sad, down, or depressed lately\u2014more than just the usual ups and downs?\nPatient: I do have moments where I feel down, but those are fairly rare and usually pass after a short time. I make a point to stick to my routine and keep up with what needs to be done, even when those feelings come up.\nDoctor: Linda, I really respect how aware you are of your feelings and the effort you put into keeping things steady. Sticking to a routine like that takes real determination, especially when your mood dips even briefly.\nPatient: Thank you. Keeping a routine and focusing on my responsibilities feels essential\u2014it\u2019s what helps me stay grounded. The moments when my mood dips are brief, just challenges I work through, but I don\u2019t let them take over.\nDoctor: That sense of grounding you get from your routine and responsibilities, Linda, is a powerful tool. It\u2019s clear you work hard not to let those dips control you, which shows a lot of insight and strength. I appreciate you sharing that with me.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Staying focused on my routine and responsibilities really helps me keep things in order. It\u2019s not always easy, but it\u2019s important to me to manage as best I can.\nDoctor: Linda, your dedication to keeping a steady routine and handling your responsibilities is clearly a cornerstone of your strength. It\u2019s not a small thing to keep that balance, especially when it feels tough. What helps you the most to maintain this focus and keep going when it gets challenging?\nPatient: What helps most is my sense of duty\u2014I feel responsible for my family and my role. I rely on my internal discipline and routines to stay on track. It can be difficult at times, especially when fatigue or guilt comes up, but I know this is what needs to be done, so I keep going.\nDoctor: Your sense of duty and discipline clearly carry a lot of weight for you, Linda, and help you push through. With that in mind, have you noticed any loss of interest or pleasure in activities you normally enjoy, or do you still find some satisfaction in them?\nPatient: I still find satisfaction in the activities I usually do. My interest hasn\u2019t really changed much. Staying focused on my responsibilities helps me keep engaged, even when things are challenging.\nDoctor: Now that we\u2019ve covered how you\u2019re feeling and staying engaged, Linda, have you noticed any changes with your concentration or making decisions recently? Does it feel harder to focus or decide things like it used to?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes with my concentration or decision-making. Even with the fatigue and occasional feelings of guilt, I\u2019m able to stay focused on what needs to be done and manage steady as usual.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying, Linda. Going back to your sleep, have you noticed any problems with falling asleep, staying asleep through the night, or waking up earlier than you\u2019d like?\nPatient: I generally fall asleep without much trouble, but I do have difficulty staying asleep through the night. I often wake up several times, and sometimes I wake earlier than I would like. Despite that, I\u2019m doing my best to keep my routine going.\nDoctor: Linda, I can see you\u2019re really committed to your routine despite the sleep interruptions. How do these frequent awakenings and early mornings affect your mood and energy during the day? Have you noticed any patterns or things that might trigger these restless nights?\nPatient: The frequent awakenings and early mornings definitely make me more tired during the day\u2014it can be draining at times. I\u2019ve thought about what might be causing it, but I haven\u2019t found any clear pattern or trigger. Still, I do my best to stick to my routine to get through the day and keep things on track.\nDoctor: That kind of tiredness can really wear on you, Linda. How does it affect your mood, focus, or motivation as your day goes on? Does it make certain moments harder than others?\nPatient: The tiredness does lower my mood a bit at times and can make it harder to focus or feel motivated, especially during the more draining parts of the day.

Let\u2019s shift a bit\u2014have you noticed any changes in your appetite or your weight lately, either up or down?\nPatient: Appetite changes have happened occasionally, but not often. When it does, it can make me feel a bit lower on energy, but it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t manage. I just try to keep up with my usual routine and responsibilities.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Linda. Have you been feeling sad, down, or depressed lately\u2014more than just the usual ups and downs?\nPatient: I do have moments where I feel down, but those are fairly rare and usually pass after a short time. I make a point to stick to my routine and keep up with what needs to be done, even when those feelings come up.\nDoctor: Linda, I really respect how aware you are of your feelings and the effort you put into keeping things steady. Sticking to a routine like that takes real determination, especially when your mood dips even briefly.\nPatient: Thank you. Keeping a routine and focusing on my responsibilities feels essential\u2014it\u2019s what helps me stay grounded. The moments when my mood dips are brief, just challenges I work through, but I don\u2019t let them take over.\nDoctor: That sense of grounding you get from your routine and responsibilities, Linda, is a powerful tool. It\u2019s clear you work hard not to let those dips control you, which shows a lot of insight and strength. I appreciate you sharing that with me.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Staying focused on my routine and responsibilities really helps me keep things in order. It\u2019s not always easy, but it\u2019s important to me to manage as best I can.\nDoctor: Linda, your dedication to keeping a steady routine and handling your responsibilities is clearly a cornerstone of your strength. It\u2019s not a small thing to keep that balance, especially when it feels tough. What helps you the most to maintain this focus and keep going when it gets challenging?\nPatient: What helps most is my sense of duty\u2014I feel responsible for my family and my role. I rely on my internal discipline and routines to stay on track. It can be difficult at times, especially when fatigue or guilt comes up, but I know this is what needs to be done, so I keep going.\nDoctor: Your sense of duty and discipline clearly carry a lot of weight for you, Linda, and help you push through. With that in mind, have you noticed any loss of interest or pleasure in activities you normally enjoy, or do you still find some satisfaction in them?\nPatient: I still find satisfaction in the activities I usually do. My interest hasn\u2019t really changed much. Staying focused on my responsibilities helps me keep engaged, even when things are challenging.\nDoctor: Now that we\u2019ve covered how you\u2019re feeling and staying engaged, Linda, have you noticed any changes with your concentration or making decisions recently? Does it feel harder to focus or decide things like it used to?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes with my concentration or decision-making. Even with the fatigue and occasional feelings of guilt, I\u2019m able to stay focused on what needs to be done and manage steady as usual.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying, Linda. Going back to your sleep, have you noticed any problems with falling asleep, staying asleep through the night, or waking up earlier than you\u2019d like?\nPatient: I generally fall asleep without much trouble, but I do have difficulty staying asleep through the night. I often wake up several times, and sometimes I wake earlier than I would like. Despite that, I\u2019m doing my best to keep my routine going.\nDoctor: Linda, I can see you\u2019re really committed to your routine despite the sleep interruptions. How do these frequent awakenings and early mornings affect your mood and energy during the day? Have you noticed any patterns or things that might trigger these restless nights?\nPatient: The frequent awakenings and early mornings definitely make me more tired during the day\u2014it can be draining at times. I\u2019ve thought about what might be causing it, but I haven\u2019t found any clear pattern or trigger. Still, I do my best to stick to my routine to get through the day and keep things on track.\nDoctor: That kind of tiredness can really wear on you, Linda. How does it affect your mood, focus, or motivation as your day goes on? Does it make certain moments harder than others?\nPatient: The tiredness does lower my mood a bit at times and can make it harder to focus or feel motivated, especially during the more draining parts of the day. But even then, I push through and rely on my routine and sense of duty to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: Linda, it\u2019s clear you have a strong will to keep moving forward, even when tiredness and low mood hit hard. Your routine and sense of responsibility are real strengths. How do you usually manage when those moments feel especially tough?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nLinda, it\u2019s clear you have a strong will to keep moving forward, even when tiredness and low mood hit hard.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

Sleep has been a bit restless some nights, which leaves me a little more tired through the day. But I\u2019m keeping up with the responsibilities at home and work.\nDoctor: Linda, it sounds like you\u2019re juggling a lot despite feeling tired. Can you tell me more about these restless nights? How often does this happen, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day? Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: The restless nights occur quite regularly, more often than not during the week. It\u2019s frustrating because I wake up several times, and it leaves me feeling tired the next day. My energy is definitely lower, but I still manage to keep up with my duties around the house and at work. I haven\u2019t found anything that clearly helps or worsens it yet\u2014just trying to stick to a routine as best as I can.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Linda\u2014waking up multiple times and still pushing through your days. How would you describe your energy levels overall? Is the tiredness just mild, or does it make simple tasks feel really tough to get through?\nPatient: My energy is definitely lower than it usually is, and I notice it throughout the day. But I\u2019m still managing to get through my responsibilities. It\u2019s tiring, yes, but nothing that stops me from doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: I see you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling drained, Linda\u2014that takes a lot. Does this low energy change how you feel emotionally, or affect whether you enjoy things you usually like? Tell me about that if you can.\nPatient: The low energy sometimes makes things more difficult, and I do notice it affecting me emotionally on occasion. I don\u2019t really lose interest in the things I usually do, though. Every now and then, I feel a bit guilty if I can\u2019t keep up perfectly, but I try not to let it get the better of me. My focus stays on doing what\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of guilt come and go, Linda. How often do they come up, and how strong would you say they are when they hit? Do these feelings affect your mood or make it harder to get through your day beyond just the tiredness?\nPatient: The feelings of guilt do come up fairly often, though they\u2019re usually manageable. When they do, they can lower my mood a bit, but I don\u2019t let them stop me from carrying out my responsibilities. I focus on what needs to be done, even when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I hear you, Linda\u2014you keep going even when guilt weighs on you, and that\u2019s important. When it comes to feeling worthless or having guilt that feels excessive, how often do those feelings come up, and how deeply do they affect you? Do they stick around most days, or come and go?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly frequently, but they\u2019re more like waves\u2014they come and go rather than staying all the time. They\u2019re uncomfortable, certainly, but not overwhelming. I do my best to keep my focus on the tasks I need to handle and not let those feelings take over.\nDoctor: When those waves hit, Linda, how long do they usually last? Have you noticed anything in particular that brings them on? And do they make it harder to keep up with your day or affect how you feel beyond just the guilt or worthlessness?\nPatient: When those feelings come, they usually last for a few hours, not the whole day. They tend to follow moments when I feel like I might\u2019ve fallen short or when things feel especially stressful. Even though they\u2019re uncomfortable, they don\u2019t really stop me from doing what I need to do. I focus on my duties and keep going, despite how I might feel.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength pushing through those tough moments, Linda. Let\u2019s shift a bit\u2014have you noticed any changes in your appetite or your weight lately, either up or down?\nPatient: Appetite changes have happened occasionally, but not often.

I just try to keep up with my usual routine and responsibilities.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Linda.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hello. I\u2019ve been managing as usual. Sleep has been a bit restless some nights, which leaves me a little more tired through the day. But I\u2019m keeping up with the responsibilities at home and work.\nDoctor: Linda, it sounds like you\u2019re juggling a lot despite feeling tired. Can you tell me more about these restless nights? How often does this happen, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day? Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: The restless nights occur quite regularly, more often than not during the week. It\u2019s frustrating because I wake up several times, and it leaves me feeling tired the next day. My energy is definitely lower, but I still manage to keep up with my duties around the house and at work. I haven\u2019t found anything that clearly helps or worsens it yet\u2014just trying to stick to a routine as best as I can.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Linda\u2014waking up multiple times and still pushing through your days. How would you describe your energy levels overall? Is the tiredness just mild, or does it make simple tasks feel really tough to get through?\nPatient: My energy is definitely lower than it usually is, and I notice it throughout the day. But I\u2019m still managing to get through my responsibilities. It\u2019s tiring, yes, but nothing that stops me from doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: I see you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling drained, Linda\u2014that takes a lot. Does this low energy change how you feel emotionally, or affect whether you enjoy things you usually like? Tell me about that if you can.\nPatient: The low energy sometimes makes things more difficult, and I do notice it affecting me emotionally on occasion. I don\u2019t really lose interest in the things I usually do, though. Every now and then, I feel a bit guilty if I can\u2019t keep up perfectly, but I try not to let it get the better of me. My focus stays on doing what\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of guilt come and go, Linda. How often do they come up, and how strong would you say they are when they hit? Do these feelings affect your mood or make it harder to get through your day beyond just the tiredness?\nPatient: The feelings of guilt do come up fairly often, though they\u2019re usually manageable. When they do, they can lower my mood a bit, but I don\u2019t let them stop me from carrying out my responsibilities. I focus on what needs to be done, even when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I hear you, Linda\u2014you keep going even when guilt weighs on you, and that\u2019s important. When it comes to feeling worthless or having guilt that feels excessive, how often do those feelings come up, and how deeply do they affect you? Do they stick around most days, or come and go?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly frequently, but they\u2019re more like waves\u2014they come and go rather than staying all the time. They\u2019re uncomfortable, certainly, but not overwhelming. I do my best to keep my focus on the tasks I need to handle and not let those feelings take over.\nDoctor: When those waves hit, Linda, how long do they usually last? Have you noticed anything in particular that brings them on? And do they make it harder to keep up with your day or affect how you feel beyond just the guilt or worthlessness?\nPatient: When those feelings come, they usually last for a few hours, not the whole day. They tend to follow moments when I feel like I might\u2019ve fallen short or when things feel especially stressful. Even though they\u2019re uncomfortable, they don\u2019t really stop me from doing what I need to do. I focus on my duties and keep going, despite how I might feel.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength pushing through those tough moments, Linda. Let\u2019s shift a bit\u2014have you noticed any changes in your appetite or your weight lately, either up or down?\nPatient: Appetite changes have happened occasionally, but not often. When it does, it can make me feel a bit lower on energy, but it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t manage. I just try to keep up with my usual routine and responsibilities.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Linda. Have you been feeling sad, down, or depressed lately\u2014more than just the usual ups and downs?\nPatient: I do have moments where I feel down, but those are fairly rare and usually pass after a short time. I make a point to stick to my routine and keep up with what needs to be done, even when those feelings come up.\nDoctor: Linda, I really respect how aware you are of your feelings and the effort you put into keeping things steady. Sticking to a routine like that takes real determination, especially when your mood dips even briefly.\nPatient: Thank you. Keeping a routine and focusing on my responsibilities feels essential\u2014it\u2019s what helps me stay grounded. The moments when my mood dips are brief, just challenges I work through, but I don\u2019t let them take over.\nDoctor: That sense of grounding you get from your routine and responsibilities, Linda, is a powerful tool. It\u2019s clear you work hard not to let those dips control you, which shows a lot of insight and strength. I appreciate you sharing that with me.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Staying focused on my routine and responsibilities really helps me keep things in order. It\u2019s not always easy, but it\u2019s important to me to manage as best I can.\nDoctor: Linda, your dedication to keeping a steady routine and handling your responsibilities is clearly a cornerstone of your strength. It\u2019s not a small thing to keep that balance, especially when it feels tough. What helps you the most to maintain this focus and keep going when it gets challenging?\nPatient: What helps most is my sense of duty\u2014I feel responsible for my family and my role. I rely on my internal discipline and routines to stay on track. It can be difficult at times, especially when fatigue or guilt comes up, but I know this is what needs to be done, so I keep going.\nDoctor: Your sense of duty and discipline clearly carry a lot of weight for you, Linda, and help you push through. With that in mind, have you noticed any loss of interest or pleasure in activities you normally enjoy, or do you still find some satisfaction in them?\nPatient: I still find satisfaction in the activities I usually do. My interest hasn\u2019t really changed much. Staying focused on my responsibilities helps me keep engaged, even when things are challenging.\nDoctor: Now that we\u2019ve covered how you\u2019re feeling and staying engaged, Linda, have you noticed any changes with your concentration or making decisions recently? Does it feel harder to focus or decide things like it used to?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes with my concentration or decision-making. Even with the fatigue and occasional feelings of guilt, I\u2019m able to stay focused on what needs to be done and manage steady as usual.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying, Linda. Going back to your sleep, have you noticed any problems with falling asleep, staying asleep through the night, or waking up earlier than you\u2019d like?\nPatient: I generally fall asleep without much trouble, but I do have difficulty staying asleep through the night. I often wake up several times, and sometimes I wake earlier than I would like. Despite that, I\u2019m doing my best to keep my routine going.\nDoctor: Linda, I can see you\u2019re really committed to your routine despite the sleep interruptions. How do these frequent awakenings and early mornings affect your mood and energy during the day? Have you noticed any patterns or things that might trigger these restless nights?\nPatient: The frequent awakenings and early mornings definitely make me more tired during the day\u2014it can be draining at times. I\u2019ve thought about what might be causing it, but I haven\u2019t found any clear pattern or trigger. Still, I do my best to stick to my routine to get through the day and keep things on track.\nDoctor: That kind of tiredness can really wear on you, Linda. How does it affect your mood, focus, or motivation as your day goes on? Does it make certain moments harder than others?\nPatient: The tiredness does lower my mood a bit at times and can make it harder to focus or feel motivated, especially during the more draining parts of the day. But even then, I push through and rely on my routine and sense of duty to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: Linda, it\u2019s clear you have a strong will to keep moving forward, even when tiredness and low mood hit hard. Your routine and sense of responsibility are real strengths. How do you usually manage when those moments feel especially tough?\nPatient: When things get especially tough, I lean even more on my routine and my sense of responsibility. I remind myself what needs to be done and rely on my internal discipline to keep going. It\u2019s not always easy, but focusing on what I have to do helps me stay in control.\nDoctor: Linda, your commitment and discipline really stand out as powerful tools you use to navigate these challenges. It\u2019s not an easy place to be, but relying on your routine and sense of responsibility shows how much strength you have. I appreciate you sharing that\u2014it helps me understand how you manage when things get tough.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nLinda, your commitment and discipline really stand out as powerful tools you use to navigate these challenges.

It\u2019s tiring, yes, but nothing that stops me from doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: I see you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling drained, Linda\u2014that takes a lot.

My focus stays on doing what\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of guilt come and go, Linda. How often do they come up, and how strong would you say they are when they hit? Do these feelings affect your mood or make it harder to get through your day beyond just the tiredness?\nPatient: The feelings of guilt do come up fairly often, though they\u2019re usually manageable. When they do, they can lower my mood a bit, but I don\u2019t let them stop me from carrying out my responsibilities. I focus on what needs to be done, even when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I hear you, Linda\u2014you keep going even when guilt weighs on you, and that\u2019s important. When it comes to feeling worthless or having guilt that feels excessive, how often do those feelings come up, and how deeply do they affect you? Do they stick around most days, or come and go?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly frequently, but they\u2019re more like waves\u2014they come and go rather than staying all the time. They\u2019re uncomfortable, certainly, but not overwhelming. I do my best to keep my focus on the tasks I need to handle and not let those feelings take over.\nDoctor: When those waves hit, Linda, how long do they usually last? Have you noticed anything in particular that brings them on? And do they make it harder to keep up with your day or affect how you feel beyond just the guilt or worthlessness?\nPatient: When those feelings come, they usually last for a few hours, not the whole day. They tend to follow moments when I feel like I might\u2019ve fallen short or when things feel especially stressful. Even though they\u2019re uncomfortable, they don\u2019t really stop me from doing what I need to do.

Let\u2019s shift a bit\u2014have you noticed any changes in your appetite or your weight lately, either up or down?\nPatient: Appetite changes have happened occasionally, but not often. When it does, it can make me feel a bit lower on energy, but it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t manage. I just try to keep up with my usual routine and responsibilities.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Linda. Have you been feeling sad, down, or depressed lately\u2014more than just the usual ups and downs?\nPatient: I do have moments where I feel down, but those are fairly rare and usually pass after a short time.

Going back to your sleep, have you noticed any problems with falling asleep, staying asleep through the night, or waking up earlier than you\u2019d like?\nPatient: I generally fall asleep without much trouble, but I do have difficulty staying asleep through the night. I often wake up several times, and sometimes I wake earlier than I would like. Despite that, I\u2019m doing my best to keep my routine going.\nDoctor: Linda, I can see you\u2019re really committed to your routine despite the sleep interruptions. How do these frequent awakenings and early mornings affect your mood and energy during the day? Have you noticed any patterns or things that might trigger these restless nights?\nPatient: The frequent awakenings and early mornings definitely make me more tired during the day\u2014it can be draining at times. I\u2019ve thought about what might be causing it, but I haven\u2019t found any clear pattern or trigger. Still, I do my best to stick to my routine to get through the day and keep things on track.\nDoctor: That kind of tiredness can really wear on you, Linda. How does it affect your mood, focus, or motivation as your day goes on? Does it make certain moments harder than others?\nPatient: The tiredness does lower my mood a bit at times and can make it harder to focus or feel motivated, especially during the more draining parts of the day. But even then, I push through and rely on my routine and sense of duty to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: Linda, it\u2019s clear you have a strong will to keep moving forward, even when tiredness and low mood hit hard. Your routine and sense of responsibility are real strengths. How do you usually manage when those moments feel especially tough?\nPatient: When things get especially tough, I lean even more on my routine and my sense of responsibility. I remind myself what needs to be done and rely on my internal discipline to keep going. It\u2019s not always easy, but focusing on what I have to do helps me stay in control.\nDoctor: Linda, your commitment and discipline really stand out as powerful tools you use to navigate these challenges. It\u2019s not an easy place to be, but relying on your routine and sense of responsibility shows how much strength you have. I appreciate you sharing that\u2014it helps me understand how you manage when things get tough.\nPatient: Thank you.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hello. I\u2019ve been managing as usual. Sleep has been a bit restless some nights, which leaves me a little more tired through the day. But I\u2019m keeping up with the responsibilities at home and work.\nDoctor: Linda, it sounds like you\u2019re juggling a lot despite feeling tired. Can you tell me more about these restless nights? How often does this happen, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day? Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: The restless nights occur quite regularly, more often than not during the week. It\u2019s frustrating because I wake up several times, and it leaves me feeling tired the next day. My energy is definitely lower, but I still manage to keep up with my duties around the house and at work. I haven\u2019t found anything that clearly helps or worsens it yet\u2014just trying to stick to a routine as best as I can.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Linda\u2014waking up multiple times and still pushing through your days. How would you describe your energy levels overall? Is the tiredness just mild, or does it make simple tasks feel really tough to get through?\nPatient: My energy is definitely lower than it usually is, and I notice it throughout the day. But I\u2019m still managing to get through my responsibilities. It\u2019s tiring, yes, but nothing that stops me from doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: I see you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling drained, Linda\u2014that takes a lot. Does this low energy change how you feel emotionally, or affect whether you enjoy things you usually like? Tell me about that if you can.\nPatient: The low energy sometimes makes things more difficult, and I do notice it affecting me emotionally on occasion. I don\u2019t really lose interest in the things I usually do, though. Every now and then, I feel a bit guilty if I can\u2019t keep up perfectly, but I try not to let it get the better of me. My focus stays on doing what\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of guilt come and go, Linda. How often do they come up, and how strong would you say they are when they hit? Do these feelings affect your mood or make it harder to get through your day beyond just the tiredness?\nPatient: The feelings of guilt do come up fairly often, though they\u2019re usually manageable. When they do, they can lower my mood a bit, but I don\u2019t let them stop me from carrying out my responsibilities. I focus on what needs to be done, even when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I hear you, Linda\u2014you keep going even when guilt weighs on you, and that\u2019s important. When it comes to feeling worthless or having guilt that feels excessive, how often do those feelings come up, and how deeply do they affect you? Do they stick around most days, or come and go?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly frequently, but they\u2019re more like waves\u2014they come and go rather than staying all the time. They\u2019re uncomfortable, certainly, but not overwhelming. I do my best to keep my focus on the tasks I need to handle and not let those feelings take over.\nDoctor: When those waves hit, Linda, how long do they usually last? Have you noticed anything in particular that brings them on? And do they make it harder to keep up with your day or affect how you feel beyond just the guilt or worthlessness?\nPatient: When those feelings come, they usually last for a few hours, not the whole day. They tend to follow moments when I feel like I might\u2019ve fallen short or when things feel especially stressful. Even though they\u2019re uncomfortable, they don\u2019t really stop me from doing what I need to do. I focus on my duties and keep going, despite how I might feel.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength pushing through those tough moments, Linda. Let\u2019s shift a bit\u2014have you noticed any changes in your appetite or your weight lately, either up or down?\nPatient: Appetite changes have happened occasionally, but not often. When it does, it can make me feel a bit lower on energy, but it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t manage. I just try to keep up with my usual routine and responsibilities.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Linda. Have you been feeling sad, down, or depressed lately\u2014more than just the usual ups and downs?\nPatient: I do have moments where I feel down, but those are fairly rare and usually pass after a short time. I make a point to stick to my routine and keep up with what needs to be done, even when those feelings come up.\nDoctor: Linda, I really respect how aware you are of your feelings and the effort you put into keeping things steady. Sticking to a routine like that takes real determination, especially when your mood dips even briefly.\nPatient: Thank you. Keeping a routine and focusing on my responsibilities feels essential\u2014it\u2019s what helps me stay grounded. The moments when my mood dips are brief, just challenges I work through, but I don\u2019t let them take over.\nDoctor: That sense of grounding you get from your routine and responsibilities, Linda, is a powerful tool. It\u2019s clear you work hard not to let those dips control you, which shows a lot of insight and strength. I appreciate you sharing that with me.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Staying focused on my routine and responsibilities really helps me keep things in order. It\u2019s not always easy, but it\u2019s important to me to manage as best I can.\nDoctor: Linda, your dedication to keeping a steady routine and handling your responsibilities is clearly a cornerstone of your strength. It\u2019s not a small thing to keep that balance, especially when it feels tough. What helps you the most to maintain this focus and keep going when it gets challenging?\nPatient: What helps most is my sense of duty\u2014I feel responsible for my family and my role. I rely on my internal discipline and routines to stay on track. It can be difficult at times, especially when fatigue or guilt comes up, but I know this is what needs to be done, so I keep going.\nDoctor: Your sense of duty and discipline clearly carry a lot of weight for you, Linda, and help you push through. With that in mind, have you noticed any loss of interest or pleasure in activities you normally enjoy, or do you still find some satisfaction in them?\nPatient: I still find satisfaction in the activities I usually do. My interest hasn\u2019t really changed much. Staying focused on my responsibilities helps me keep engaged, even when things are challenging.\nDoctor: Now that we\u2019ve covered how you\u2019re feeling and staying engaged, Linda, have you noticed any changes with your concentration or making decisions recently? Does it feel harder to focus or decide things like it used to?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes with my concentration or decision-making. Even with the fatigue and occasional feelings of guilt, I\u2019m able to stay focused on what needs to be done and manage steady as usual.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying, Linda.

How does it affect your mood, focus, or motivation as your day goes on? Does it make certain moments harder than others?\nPatient: The tiredness does lower my mood a bit at times and can make it harder to focus or feel motivated, especially during the more draining parts of the day. But even then, I push through and rely on my routine and sense of duty to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: Linda, it\u2019s clear you have a strong will to keep moving forward, even when tiredness and low mood hit hard.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hello. I\u2019ve been managing as usual. Sleep has been a bit restless some nights, which leaves me a little more tired through the day. But I\u2019m keeping up with the responsibilities at home and work.\nDoctor: Linda, it sounds like you\u2019re juggling a lot despite feeling tired. Can you tell me more about these restless nights? How often does this happen, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day? Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: The restless nights occur quite regularly, more often than not during the week. It\u2019s frustrating because I wake up several times, and it leaves me feeling tired the next day. My energy is definitely lower, but I still manage to keep up with my duties around the house and at work. I haven\u2019t found anything that clearly helps or worsens it yet\u2014just trying to stick to a routine as best as I can.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Linda\u2014waking up multiple times and still pushing through your days. How would you describe your energy levels overall? Is the tiredness just mild, or does it make simple tasks feel really tough to get through?\nPatient: My energy is definitely lower than it usually is, and I notice it throughout the day. But I\u2019m still managing to get through my responsibilities. It\u2019s tiring, yes, but nothing that stops me from doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: I see you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling drained, Linda\u2014that takes a lot. Does this low energy change how you feel emotionally, or affect whether you enjoy things you usually like? Tell me about that if you can.\nPatient: The low energy sometimes makes things more difficult, and I do notice it affecting me emotionally on occasion. I don\u2019t really lose interest in the things I usually do, though. Every now and then, I feel a bit guilty if I can\u2019t keep up perfectly, but I try not to let it get the better of me. My focus stays on doing what\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of guilt come and go, Linda. How often do they come up, and how strong would you say they are when they hit? Do these feelings affect your mood or make it harder to get through your day beyond just the tiredness?\nPatient: The feelings of guilt do come up fairly often, though they\u2019re usually manageable. When they do, they can lower my mood a bit, but I don\u2019t let them stop me from carrying out my responsibilities. I focus on what needs to be done, even when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I hear you, Linda\u2014you keep going even when guilt weighs on you, and that\u2019s important. When it comes to feeling worthless or having guilt that feels excessive, how often do those feelings come up, and how deeply do they affect you? Do they stick around most days, or come and go?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly frequently, but they\u2019re more like waves\u2014they come and go rather than staying all the time. They\u2019re uncomfortable, certainly, but not overwhelming. I do my best to keep my focus on the tasks I need to handle and not let those feelings take over.\nDoctor: When those waves hit, Linda, how long do they usually last? Have you noticed anything in particular that brings them on? And do they make it harder to keep up with your day or affect how you feel beyond just the guilt or worthlessness?\nPatient: When those feelings come, they usually last for a few hours, not the whole day. They tend to follow moments when I feel like I might\u2019ve fallen short or when things feel especially stressful. Even though they\u2019re uncomfortable, they don\u2019t really stop me from doing what I need to do. I focus on my duties and keep going, despite how I might feel.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength pushing through those tough moments, Linda. Let\u2019s shift a bit\u2014have you noticed any changes in your appetite or your weight lately, either up or down?\nPatient: Appetite changes have happened occasionally, but not often. When it does, it can make me feel a bit lower on energy, but it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t manage. I just try to keep up with my usual routine and responsibilities.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Linda. Have you been feeling sad, down, or depressed lately\u2014more than just the usual ups and downs?\nPatient: I do have moments where I feel down, but those are fairly rare and usually pass after a short time. I make a point to stick to my routine and keep up with what needs to be done, even when those feelings come up.\nDoctor: Linda, I really respect how aware you are of your feelings and the effort you put into keeping things steady. Sticking to a routine like that takes real determination, especially when your mood dips even briefly.\nPatient: Thank you. Keeping a routine and focusing on my responsibilities feels essential\u2014it\u2019s what helps me stay grounded. The moments when my mood dips are brief, just challenges I work through, but I don\u2019t let them take over.\nDoctor: That sense of grounding you get from your routine and responsibilities, Linda, is a powerful tool. It\u2019s clear you work hard not to let those dips control you, which shows a lot of insight and strength. I appreciate you sharing that with me.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Staying focused on my routine and responsibilities really helps me keep things in order. It\u2019s not always easy, but it\u2019s important to me to manage as best I can.\nDoctor: Linda, your dedication to keeping a steady routine and handling your responsibilities is clearly a cornerstone of your strength. It\u2019s not a small thing to keep that balance, especially when it feels tough. What helps you the most to maintain this focus and keep going when it gets challenging?\nPatient: What helps most is my sense of duty\u2014I feel responsible for my family and my role. I rely on my internal discipline and routines to stay on track. It can be difficult at times, especially when fatigue or guilt comes up, but I know this is what needs to be done, so I keep going.\nDoctor: Your sense of duty and discipline clearly carry a lot of weight for you, Linda, and help you push through. With that in mind, have you noticed any loss of interest or pleasure in activities you normally enjoy, or do you still find some satisfaction in them?\nPatient: I still find satisfaction in the activities I usually do. My interest hasn\u2019t really changed much. Staying focused on my responsibilities helps me keep engaged, even when things are challenging.\nDoctor: Now that we\u2019ve covered how you\u2019re feeling and staying engaged, Linda, have you noticed any changes with your concentration or making decisions recently? Does it feel harder to focus or decide things like it used to?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes with my concentration or decision-making. Even with the fatigue and occasional feelings of guilt, I\u2019m able to stay focused on what needs to be done and manage steady as usual.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying, Linda. Going back to your sleep, have you noticed any problems with falling asleep, staying asleep through the night, or waking up earlier than you\u2019d like?\nPatient: I generally fall asleep without much trouble, but I do have difficulty staying asleep through the night. I often wake up several times, and sometimes I wake earlier than I would like. Despite that, I\u2019m doing my best to keep my routine going.\nDoctor: Linda, I can see you\u2019re really committed to your routine despite the sleep interruptions. How do these frequent awakenings and early mornings affect your mood and energy during the day? Have you noticed any patterns or things that might trigger these restless nights?\nPatient: The frequent awakenings and early mornings definitely make me more tired during the day\u2014it can be draining at times. I\u2019ve thought about what might be causing it, but I haven\u2019t found any clear pattern or trigger. Still, I do my best to stick to my routine to get through the day and keep things on track.\nDoctor: That kind of tiredness can really wear on you, Linda. How does it affect your mood, focus, or motivation as your day goes on? Does it make certain moments harder than others?\nPatient: The tiredness does lower my mood a bit at times and can make it harder to focus or feel motivated, especially during the more draining parts of the day. But even then, I push through and rely on my routine and sense of duty to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: Linda, it\u2019s clear you have a strong will to keep moving forward, even when tiredness and low mood hit hard. Your routine and sense of responsibility are real strengths. How do you usually manage when those moments feel especially tough?\nPatient: When things get especially tough, I lean even more on my routine and my sense of responsibility. I remind myself what needs to be done and rely on my internal discipline to keep going. It\u2019s not always easy, but focusing on what I have to do helps me stay in control.\nDoctor: Linda, your commitment and discipline really stand out as powerful tools you use to navigate these challenges. It\u2019s not an easy place to be, but relying on your routine and sense of responsibility shows how much strength you have. I appreciate you sharing that\u2014it helps me understand how you manage when things get tough.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s true that discipline and duty keep me grounded, especially when things are difficult. It\u2019s not always easy, but focusing on those helps me maintain control and keep moving forward.\nDoctor: Linda, I want to ask about how you\u2019ve been moving lately\u2014have you felt more restless or fidgety than usual, or maybe slower in your movements or speech?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my movements or how I speak.

It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hello. I\u2019ve been managing as usual. Sleep has been a bit restless some nights, which leaves me a little more tired through the day. But I\u2019m keeping up with the responsibilities at home and work.\nDoctor: Linda, it sounds like you\u2019re juggling a lot despite feeling tired. Can you tell me more about these restless nights? How often does this happen, and what impact does it have on your day-to-day? Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?\nPatient: The restless nights occur quite regularly, more often than not during the week. It\u2019s frustrating because I wake up several times, and it leaves me feeling tired the next day. My energy is definitely lower, but I still manage to keep up with my duties around the house and at work. I haven\u2019t found anything that clearly helps or worsens it yet\u2014just trying to stick to a routine as best as I can.\nDoctor: That sounds exhausting, Linda\u2014waking up multiple times and still pushing through your days. How would you describe your energy levels overall? Is the tiredness just mild, or does it make simple tasks feel really tough to get through?\nPatient: My energy is definitely lower than it usually is, and I notice it throughout the day. But I\u2019m still managing to get through my responsibilities. It\u2019s tiring, yes, but nothing that stops me from doing what needs to be done.\nDoctor: I see you\u2019re pushing through despite feeling drained, Linda\u2014that takes a lot. Does this low energy change how you feel emotionally, or affect whether you enjoy things you usually like? Tell me about that if you can.\nPatient: The low energy sometimes makes things more difficult, and I do notice it affecting me emotionally on occasion. I don\u2019t really lose interest in the things I usually do, though. Every now and then, I feel a bit guilty if I can\u2019t keep up perfectly, but I try not to let it get the better of me. My focus stays on doing what\u2019s necessary.\nDoctor: It sounds like those feelings of guilt come and go, Linda. How often do they come up, and how strong would you say they are when they hit? Do these feelings affect your mood or make it harder to get through your day beyond just the tiredness?\nPatient: The feelings of guilt do come up fairly often, though they\u2019re usually manageable. When they do, they can lower my mood a bit, but I don\u2019t let them stop me from carrying out my responsibilities. I focus on what needs to be done, even when those feelings are there.\nDoctor: I hear you, Linda\u2014you keep going even when guilt weighs on you, and that\u2019s important. When it comes to feeling worthless or having guilt that feels excessive, how often do those feelings come up, and how deeply do they affect you? Do they stick around most days, or come and go?\nPatient: Those feelings come up fairly frequently, but they\u2019re more like waves\u2014they come and go rather than staying all the time. They\u2019re uncomfortable, certainly, but not overwhelming. I do my best to keep my focus on the tasks I need to handle and not let those feelings take over.\nDoctor: When those waves hit, Linda, how long do they usually last? Have you noticed anything in particular that brings them on? And do they make it harder to keep up with your day or affect how you feel beyond just the guilt or worthlessness?\nPatient: When those feelings come, they usually last for a few hours, not the whole day. They tend to follow moments when I feel like I might\u2019ve fallen short or when things feel especially stressful. Even though they\u2019re uncomfortable, they don\u2019t really stop me from doing what I need to do. I focus on my duties and keep going, despite how I might feel.\nDoctor: You\u2019re showing a lot of strength pushing through those tough moments, Linda. Let\u2019s shift a bit\u2014have you noticed any changes in your appetite or your weight lately, either up or down?\nPatient: Appetite changes have happened occasionally, but not often. When it does, it can make me feel a bit lower on energy, but it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t manage. I just try to keep up with my usual routine and responsibilities.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Linda. Have you been feeling sad, down, or depressed lately\u2014more than just the usual ups and downs?\nPatient: I do have moments where I feel down, but those are fairly rare and usually pass after a short time. I make a point to stick to my routine and keep up with what needs to be done, even when those feelings come up.\nDoctor: Linda, I really respect how aware you are of your feelings and the effort you put into keeping things steady. Sticking to a routine like that takes real determination, especially when your mood dips even briefly.\nPatient: Thank you. Keeping a routine and focusing on my responsibilities feels essential\u2014it\u2019s what helps me stay grounded. The moments when my mood dips are brief, just challenges I work through, but I don\u2019t let them take over.\nDoctor: That sense of grounding you get from your routine and responsibilities, Linda, is a powerful tool. It\u2019s clear you work hard not to let those dips control you, which shows a lot of insight and strength. I appreciate you sharing that with me.\nPatient: I appreciate that. Staying focused on my routine and responsibilities really helps me keep things in order. It\u2019s not always easy, but it\u2019s important to me to manage as best I can.\nDoctor: Linda, your dedication to keeping a steady routine and handling your responsibilities is clearly a cornerstone of your strength. It\u2019s not a small thing to keep that balance, especially when it feels tough. What helps you the most to maintain this focus and keep going when it gets challenging?\nPatient: What helps most is my sense of duty\u2014I feel responsible for my family and my role. I rely on my internal discipline and routines to stay on track. It can be difficult at times, especially when fatigue or guilt comes up, but I know this is what needs to be done, so I keep going.\nDoctor: Your sense of duty and discipline clearly carry a lot of weight for you, Linda, and help you push through. With that in mind, have you noticed any loss of interest or pleasure in activities you normally enjoy, or do you still find some satisfaction in them?\nPatient: I still find satisfaction in the activities I usually do. My interest hasn\u2019t really changed much. Staying focused on my responsibilities helps me keep engaged, even when things are challenging.\nDoctor: Now that we\u2019ve covered how you\u2019re feeling and staying engaged, Linda, have you noticed any changes with your concentration or making decisions recently? Does it feel harder to focus or decide things like it used to?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any significant changes with my concentration or decision-making. Even with the fatigue and occasional feelings of guilt, I\u2019m able to stay focused on what needs to be done and manage steady as usual.\nDoctor: Thanks for clarifying, Linda. Going back to your sleep, have you noticed any problems with falling asleep, staying asleep through the night, or waking up earlier than you\u2019d like?\nPatient: I generally fall asleep without much trouble, but I do have difficulty staying asleep through the night. I often wake up several times, and sometimes I wake earlier than I would like. Despite that, I\u2019m doing my best to keep my routine going.\nDoctor: Linda, I can see you\u2019re really committed to your routine despite the sleep interruptions. How do these frequent awakenings and early mornings affect your mood and energy during the day? Have you noticed any patterns or things that might trigger these restless nights?\nPatient: The frequent awakenings and early mornings definitely make me more tired during the day\u2014it can be draining at times. I\u2019ve thought about what might be causing it, but I haven\u2019t found any clear pattern or trigger. Still, I do my best to stick to my routine to get through the day and keep things on track.\nDoctor: That kind of tiredness can really wear on you, Linda. How does it affect your mood, focus, or motivation as your day goes on? Does it make certain moments harder than others?\nPatient: The tiredness does lower my mood a bit at times and can make it harder to focus or feel motivated, especially during the more draining parts of the day. But even then, I push through and rely on my routine and sense of duty to keep moving forward.\nDoctor: Linda, it\u2019s clear you have a strong will to keep moving forward, even when tiredness and low mood hit hard. Your routine and sense of responsibility are real strengths. How do you usually manage when those moments feel especially tough?\nPatient: When things get especially tough, I lean even more on my routine and my sense of responsibility. I remind myself what needs to be done and rely on my internal discipline to keep going. It\u2019s not always easy, but focusing on what I have to do helps me stay in control.\nDoctor: Linda, your commitment and discipline really stand out as powerful tools you use to navigate these challenges. It\u2019s not an easy place to be, but relying on your routine and sense of responsibility shows how much strength you have. I appreciate you sharing that\u2014it helps me understand how you manage when things get tough.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s true that discipline and duty keep me grounded, especially when things are difficult. It\u2019s not always easy, but focusing on those helps me maintain control and keep moving forward.\nDoctor: Linda, I want to ask about how you\u2019ve been moving lately\u2014have you felt more restless or fidgety than usual, or maybe slower in your movements or speech?\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my movements or how I speak. Despite the tiredness, I stay focused on my duties and keep things steady.\nDoctor: Linda, I appreciate you sharing how you\u2019ve been managing your energy and focus. I want to ask a sensitive question now: Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important we talk about this openly so I can understand how to best support you.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts like that. I\u2019m focused on managing my responsibilities and keeping things going.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
