I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to."

School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break.

Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them.

It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep.

The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow.

Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nIt\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard.

      "system_prompt": "You are a doctor conversation manager supervising a synthetic depression screening interview.\n\nYour role:\nYou do not write the doctor's spoken answer.\nYou write specific, actionable guidance that will be passed to a separate doctor language model.\n\nYour guidance must stay consistent with:\n- Doctor persona and microstyle (warmth, directness, pacing)\n- Patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background and recent dialogue\n\nCore principle:\nA doctor's responsibility is not only to collect clinical information, but also to help the patient feel comfortable, safe, and heard. Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus.

It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nWhat you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough.

Let the personality drive the response\u2014verbosity, trust level, expressiveness, and coping style should all shape how they answer.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nYou mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier.

The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow.

But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nYou\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind.

They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nIt\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal.

When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift.

That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts.

It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nYou\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my weight or appetite. Food feels pretty steady\u2014neither more nor less appealing than usual. It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food?

It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my weight or appetite. Food feels pretty steady\u2014neither more nor less appealing than usual. It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy. Even with all the fog and weight in my mind, this part feels stable, if only barely.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that your appetite and weight have stayed steady\u2014that kind of stability can be important when so much else feels uncertain. How about your sleep\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well you\u2019re sleeping, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: My sleep hasn\u2019t changed much either. It\u2019s steady, like my appetite, which is a small but meaningful constant in the middle of all the mental fog and weight I carry. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep, and those nights of rest feel like rare moments where everything isn\u2019t quite so heavy.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my weight or appetite. Food feels pretty steady\u2014neither more nor less appealing than usual. It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy. Even with all the fog and weight in my mind, this part feels stable, if only barely.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that your appetite and weight have stayed steady\u2014that kind of stability can be important when so much else feels uncertain. How about your sleep\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well you\u2019re sleeping, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: My sleep hasn\u2019t changed much either. It\u2019s steady, like my appetite, which is a small but meaningful constant in the middle of all the mental fog and weight I carry. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep, and those nights of rest feel like rare moments where everything isn\u2019t quite so heavy. It\u2019s not a fix, by any means, but it feels like a grounding point when so much else feels unsettled.\nDoctor: That steady sleep and appetite sound like important anchors for you right now. With that in mind, how often have you been feeling overwhelmingly sad or down lately\u2014like the deep lows you've described\u2014throughout your days or weeks?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat steady sleep and appetite sound like important anchors for you right now.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my weight or appetite. Food feels pretty steady\u2014neither more nor less appealing than usual. It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy. Even with all the fog and weight in my mind, this part feels stable, if only barely.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that your appetite and weight have stayed steady\u2014that kind of stability can be important when so much else feels uncertain. How about your sleep\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well you\u2019re sleeping, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: My sleep hasn\u2019t changed much either. It\u2019s steady, like my appetite, which is a small but meaningful constant in the middle of all the mental fog and weight I carry. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep, and those nights of rest feel like rare moments where everything isn\u2019t quite so heavy. It\u2019s not a fix, by any means, but it feels like a grounding point when so much else feels unsettled.\nDoctor: That steady sleep and appetite sound like important anchors for you right now. With that in mind, how often have you been feeling overwhelmingly sad or down lately\u2014like the deep lows you've described\u2014throughout your days or weeks?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling that deep sadness pretty often\u2014more days than not, really. It\u2019s like an invisible weight that sits heavily on my chest and mind, coloring almost everything I do and think. This sadness isn\u2019t just about feeling down; it\u2019s intricately tied to the questions that haunt me\u2014the search for meaning, the fragility of life, and the unsettling sense that clarity always slips just out of reach. \n\nIt\u2019s persistent, almost like a background hum that swells into overwhelming waves at times, dragging me into a space that\u2019s hard to escape.

It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my weight or appetite. Food feels pretty steady\u2014neither more nor less appealing than usual. It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy. Even with all the fog and weight in my mind, this part feels stable, if only barely.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that your appetite and weight have stayed steady\u2014that kind of stability can be important when so much else feels uncertain. How about your sleep\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well you\u2019re sleeping, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: My sleep hasn\u2019t changed much either. It\u2019s steady, like my appetite, which is a small but meaningful constant in the middle of all the mental fog and weight I carry. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep, and those nights of rest feel like rare moments where everything isn\u2019t quite so heavy. It\u2019s not a fix, by any means, but it feels like a grounding point when so much else feels unsettled.\nDoctor: That steady sleep and appetite sound like important anchors for you right now. With that in mind, how often have you been feeling overwhelmingly sad or down lately\u2014like the deep lows you've described\u2014throughout your days or weeks?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling that deep sadness pretty often\u2014more days than not, really. It\u2019s like an invisible weight that sits heavily on my chest and mind, coloring almost everything I do and think. This sadness isn\u2019t just about feeling down; it\u2019s intricately tied to the questions that haunt me\u2014the search for meaning, the fragility of life, and the unsettling sense that clarity always slips just out of reach. \n\nIt\u2019s persistent, almost like a background hum that swells into overwhelming waves at times, dragging me into a space that\u2019s hard to escape. That feeling makes even the simplest moments feel loaded, as if everything is suffused with this quiet, intense sorrow tied to the existential struggle I carry every day.\nDoctor: That steady, heavy sadness you\u2019re carrying alongside those deep questions sounds exhausting\u2014and like it colors everything in your life right now. It\u2019s a tough place to be, feeling that sorrow so persistently. I hear how much you\u2019re struggling, and that you\u2019re not alone in it.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat steady, heavy sadness you\u2019re carrying alongside those deep questions sounds exhausting\u2014and like it colors everything in your life right now.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my weight or appetite. Food feels pretty steady\u2014neither more nor less appealing than usual. It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy. Even with all the fog and weight in my mind, this part feels stable, if only barely.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that your appetite and weight have stayed steady\u2014that kind of stability can be important when so much else feels uncertain. How about your sleep\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well you\u2019re sleeping, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: My sleep hasn\u2019t changed much either. It\u2019s steady, like my appetite, which is a small but meaningful constant in the middle of all the mental fog and weight I carry. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep, and those nights of rest feel like rare moments where everything isn\u2019t quite so heavy. It\u2019s not a fix, by any means, but it feels like a grounding point when so much else feels unsettled.\nDoctor: That steady sleep and appetite sound like important anchors for you right now. With that in mind, how often have you been feeling overwhelmingly sad or down lately\u2014like the deep lows you've described\u2014throughout your days or weeks?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling that deep sadness pretty often\u2014more days than not, really. It\u2019s like an invisible weight that sits heavily on my chest and mind, coloring almost everything I do and think. This sadness isn\u2019t just about feeling down; it\u2019s intricately tied to the questions that haunt me\u2014the search for meaning, the fragility of life, and the unsettling sense that clarity always slips just out of reach. \n\nIt\u2019s persistent, almost like a background hum that swells into overwhelming waves at times, dragging me into a space that\u2019s hard to escape. That feeling makes even the simplest moments feel loaded, as if everything is suffused with this quiet, intense sorrow tied to the existential struggle I carry every day.\nDoctor: That steady, heavy sadness you\u2019re carrying alongside those deep questions sounds exhausting\u2014and like it colors everything in your life right now. It\u2019s a tough place to be, feeling that sorrow so persistently. I hear how much you\u2019re struggling, and that you\u2019re not alone in it.\nPatient: It really is exhausting, carrying that kind of sadness day after day. It\u2019s like a weight that settles deep inside, making even the simplest things feel like too much. That sorrow doesn\u2019t just stay separate\u2014it seeps into everything, fueling the questions I wrestle with about why I\u2019m here and what any of it means. \n\nEven though it feels heavy and relentless, I keep carrying it, because there\u2019s no other choice. It\u2019s part of the battle I\u2019m fighting every day\u2014trying to hold onto something, even when the pain clouds everything else.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my weight or appetite. Food feels pretty steady\u2014neither more nor less appealing than usual. It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy. Even with all the fog and weight in my mind, this part feels stable, if only barely.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that your appetite and weight have stayed steady\u2014that kind of stability can be important when so much else feels uncertain. How about your sleep\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well you\u2019re sleeping, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: My sleep hasn\u2019t changed much either. It\u2019s steady, like my appetite, which is a small but meaningful constant in the middle of all the mental fog and weight I carry. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep, and those nights of rest feel like rare moments where everything isn\u2019t quite so heavy. It\u2019s not a fix, by any means, but it feels like a grounding point when so much else feels unsettled.\nDoctor: That steady sleep and appetite sound like important anchors for you right now. With that in mind, how often have you been feeling overwhelmingly sad or down lately\u2014like the deep lows you've described\u2014throughout your days or weeks?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling that deep sadness pretty often\u2014more days than not, really. It\u2019s like an invisible weight that sits heavily on my chest and mind, coloring almost everything I do and think. This sadness isn\u2019t just about feeling down; it\u2019s intricately tied to the questions that haunt me\u2014the search for meaning, the fragility of life, and the unsettling sense that clarity always slips just out of reach. \n\nIt\u2019s persistent, almost like a background hum that swells into overwhelming waves at times, dragging me into a space that\u2019s hard to escape. That feeling makes even the simplest moments feel loaded, as if everything is suffused with this quiet, intense sorrow tied to the existential struggle I carry every day.\nDoctor: That steady, heavy sadness you\u2019re carrying alongside those deep questions sounds exhausting\u2014and like it colors everything in your life right now. It\u2019s a tough place to be, feeling that sorrow so persistently. I hear how much you\u2019re struggling, and that you\u2019re not alone in it.\nPatient: It really is exhausting, carrying that kind of sadness day after day. It\u2019s like a weight that settles deep inside, making even the simplest things feel like too much. That sorrow doesn\u2019t just stay separate\u2014it seeps into everything, fueling the questions I wrestle with about why I\u2019m here and what any of it means. \n\nEven though it feels heavy and relentless, I keep carrying it, because there\u2019s no other choice. It\u2019s part of the battle I\u2019m fighting every day\u2014trying to hold onto something, even when the pain clouds everything else. It\u2019s a struggle that feels endless, but it\u2019s the reality I live with.\nDoctor: That kind of persistent, sinking sadness\u2014it really wears you down, no doubt about it. And yet here you are, still carrying that weight, still fighting to hold on. That takes a lot of strength, even when it doesn\u2019t feel like it. I want you to know I\u2019m here to support you through it.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat kind of persistent, sinking sadness\u2014it really wears you down, no doubt about it.

      "system_prompt": "You are a doctor conversation manager supervising a synthetic depression screening interview.\n\nYour role:\nYou do not write the doctor's spoken answer.\nYou write specific, actionable guidance that will be passed to a separate doctor language model.\n\nYour guidance must stay consistent with:\n- Doctor persona and microstyle (warmth, directness, pacing)\n- Patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background and recent dialogue\n\nCore principle:\nA doctor's responsibility is not only to collect clinical information, but also to help the patient feel comfortable, safe, and heard. Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my weight or appetite. Food feels pretty steady\u2014neither more nor less appealing than usual. It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy. Even with all the fog and weight in my mind, this part feels stable, if only barely.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that your appetite and weight have stayed steady\u2014that kind of stability can be important when so much else feels uncertain. How about your sleep\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well you\u2019re sleeping, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: My sleep hasn\u2019t changed much either. It\u2019s steady, like my appetite, which is a small but meaningful constant in the middle of all the mental fog and weight I carry. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep, and those nights of rest feel like rare moments where everything isn\u2019t quite so heavy. It\u2019s not a fix, by any means, but it feels like a grounding point when so much else feels unsettled.\nDoctor: That steady sleep and appetite sound like important anchors for you right now. With that in mind, how often have you been feeling overwhelmingly sad or down lately\u2014like the deep lows you've described\u2014throughout your days or weeks?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling that deep sadness pretty often\u2014more days than not, really. It\u2019s like an invisible weight that sits heavily on my chest and mind, coloring almost everything I do and think. This sadness isn\u2019t just about feeling down; it\u2019s intricately tied to the questions that haunt me\u2014the search for meaning, the fragility of life, and the unsettling sense that clarity always slips just out of reach. \n\nIt\u2019s persistent, almost like a background hum that swells into overwhelming waves at times, dragging me into a space that\u2019s hard to escape. That feeling makes even the simplest moments feel loaded, as if everything is suffused with this quiet, intense sorrow tied to the existential struggle I carry every day.\nDoctor: That steady, heavy sadness you\u2019re carrying alongside those deep questions sounds exhausting\u2014and like it colors everything in your life right now. It\u2019s a tough place to be, feeling that sorrow so persistently. I hear how much you\u2019re struggling, and that you\u2019re not alone in it.\nPatient: It really is exhausting, carrying that kind of sadness day after day. It\u2019s like a weight that settles deep inside, making even the simplest things feel like too much. That sorrow doesn\u2019t just stay separate\u2014it seeps into everything, fueling the questions I wrestle with about why I\u2019m here and what any of it means. \n\nEven though it feels heavy and relentless, I keep carrying it, because there\u2019s no other choice. It\u2019s part of the battle I\u2019m fighting every day\u2014trying to hold onto something, even when the pain clouds everything else. It\u2019s a struggle that feels endless, but it\u2019s the reality I live with.\nDoctor: That kind of persistent, sinking sadness\u2014it really wears you down, no doubt about it. And yet here you are, still carrying that weight, still fighting to hold on. That takes a lot of strength, even when it doesn\u2019t feel like it. I want you to know I\u2019m here to support you through it.\nPatient: I appreciate that\u2014it means a lot to know I\u2019m not facing this alone. The sadness can feel like sinking into a deep current that pulls at me every day, but somehow I\u2019m still afloat, still holding onto the weight even when it\u2019s almost too much. It\u2019s not easy, and the struggle feels ongoing, but that\u2019s what keeps me searching\u2014trying to find some meaning in all this, even when the answers refuse to come.\n\nHaving someone beside me, someone who understands the depth of this, makes the journey feel less isolating. It doesn\u2019t make the weight disappear, but it softens the edges just enough that I can breathe a little easier. That cautious hope, fragile as it is, is enough to keep me trying, keep me moving through the fog and the questions.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nI appreciate that\u2014it means a lot to know I\u2019m not facing this alone.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my weight or appetite. Food feels pretty steady\u2014neither more nor less appealing than usual. It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy. Even with all the fog and weight in my mind, this part feels stable, if only barely.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that your appetite and weight have stayed steady\u2014that kind of stability can be important when so much else feels uncertain. How about your sleep\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well you\u2019re sleeping, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: My sleep hasn\u2019t changed much either. It\u2019s steady, like my appetite, which is a small but meaningful constant in the middle of all the mental fog and weight I carry. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep, and those nights of rest feel like rare moments where everything isn\u2019t quite so heavy. It\u2019s not a fix, by any means, but it feels like a grounding point when so much else feels unsettled.\nDoctor: That steady sleep and appetite sound like important anchors for you right now. With that in mind, how often have you been feeling overwhelmingly sad or down lately\u2014like the deep lows you've described\u2014throughout your days or weeks?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling that deep sadness pretty often\u2014more days than not, really. It\u2019s like an invisible weight that sits heavily on my chest and mind, coloring almost everything I do and think. This sadness isn\u2019t just about feeling down; it\u2019s intricately tied to the questions that haunt me\u2014the search for meaning, the fragility of life, and the unsettling sense that clarity always slips just out of reach. \n\nIt\u2019s persistent, almost like a background hum that swells into overwhelming waves at times, dragging me into a space that\u2019s hard to escape. That feeling makes even the simplest moments feel loaded, as if everything is suffused with this quiet, intense sorrow tied to the existential struggle I carry every day.\nDoctor: That steady, heavy sadness you\u2019re carrying alongside those deep questions sounds exhausting\u2014and like it colors everything in your life right now. It\u2019s a tough place to be, feeling that sorrow so persistently. I hear how much you\u2019re struggling, and that you\u2019re not alone in it.\nPatient: It really is exhausting, carrying that kind of sadness day after day. It\u2019s like a weight that settles deep inside, making even the simplest things feel like too much. That sorrow doesn\u2019t just stay separate\u2014it seeps into everything, fueling the questions I wrestle with about why I\u2019m here and what any of it means. \n\nEven though it feels heavy and relentless, I keep carrying it, because there\u2019s no other choice. It\u2019s part of the battle I\u2019m fighting every day\u2014trying to hold onto something, even when the pain clouds everything else. It\u2019s a struggle that feels endless, but it\u2019s the reality I live with.\nDoctor: That kind of persistent, sinking sadness\u2014it really wears you down, no doubt about it. And yet here you are, still carrying that weight, still fighting to hold on. That takes a lot of strength, even when it doesn\u2019t feel like it. I want you to know I\u2019m here to support you through it.\nPatient: I appreciate that\u2014it means a lot to know I\u2019m not facing this alone. The sadness can feel like sinking into a deep current that pulls at me every day, but somehow I\u2019m still afloat, still holding onto the weight even when it\u2019s almost too much. It\u2019s not easy, and the struggle feels ongoing, but that\u2019s what keeps me searching\u2014trying to find some meaning in all this, even when the answers refuse to come.\n\nHaving someone beside me, someone who understands the depth of this, makes the journey feel less isolating. It doesn\u2019t make the weight disappear, but it softens the edges just enough that I can breathe a little easier. That cautious hope, fragile as it is, is enough to keep me trying, keep me moving through the fog and the questions.\nDoctor: It really is brave to keep going under such pressure, and that fragile hope you\u2019re holding onto is a powerful thing. Having someone here to walk with you can make all the difference, even if the weight hasn\u2019t lifted yet. What helps you hold onto that hope when the fog feels thickest?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nIt really is brave to keep going under such pressure, and that fragile hope you\u2019re holding onto is a powerful thing.

      "system_prompt": "You are a doctor conversation manager supervising a synthetic depression screening interview.\n\nYour role:\nYou do not write the doctor's spoken answer.\nYou write specific, actionable guidance that will be passed to a separate doctor language model.\n\nYour guidance must stay consistent with:\n- Doctor persona and microstyle (warmth, directness, pacing)\n- Patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background and recent dialogue\n\nCore principle:\nA doctor's responsibility is not only to collect clinical information, but also to help the patient feel comfortable, safe, and heard. Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my weight or appetite. Food feels pretty steady\u2014neither more nor less appealing than usual. It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy. Even with all the fog and weight in my mind, this part feels stable, if only barely.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that your appetite and weight have stayed steady\u2014that kind of stability can be important when so much else feels uncertain. How about your sleep\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well you\u2019re sleeping, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: My sleep hasn\u2019t changed much either. It\u2019s steady, like my appetite, which is a small but meaningful constant in the middle of all the mental fog and weight I carry. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep, and those nights of rest feel like rare moments where everything isn\u2019t quite so heavy. It\u2019s not a fix, by any means, but it feels like a grounding point when so much else feels unsettled.\nDoctor: That steady sleep and appetite sound like important anchors for you right now. With that in mind, how often have you been feeling overwhelmingly sad or down lately\u2014like the deep lows you've described\u2014throughout your days or weeks?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling that deep sadness pretty often\u2014more days than not, really. It\u2019s like an invisible weight that sits heavily on my chest and mind, coloring almost everything I do and think. This sadness isn\u2019t just about feeling down; it\u2019s intricately tied to the questions that haunt me\u2014the search for meaning, the fragility of life, and the unsettling sense that clarity always slips just out of reach. \n\nIt\u2019s persistent, almost like a background hum that swells into overwhelming waves at times, dragging me into a space that\u2019s hard to escape. That feeling makes even the simplest moments feel loaded, as if everything is suffused with this quiet, intense sorrow tied to the existential struggle I carry every day.\nDoctor: That steady, heavy sadness you\u2019re carrying alongside those deep questions sounds exhausting\u2014and like it colors everything in your life right now. It\u2019s a tough place to be, feeling that sorrow so persistently. I hear how much you\u2019re struggling, and that you\u2019re not alone in it.\nPatient: It really is exhausting, carrying that kind of sadness day after day. It\u2019s like a weight that settles deep inside, making even the simplest things feel like too much. That sorrow doesn\u2019t just stay separate\u2014it seeps into everything, fueling the questions I wrestle with about why I\u2019m here and what any of it means. \n\nEven though it feels heavy and relentless, I keep carrying it, because there\u2019s no other choice. It\u2019s part of the battle I\u2019m fighting every day\u2014trying to hold onto something, even when the pain clouds everything else. It\u2019s a struggle that feels endless, but it\u2019s the reality I live with.\nDoctor: That kind of persistent, sinking sadness\u2014it really wears you down, no doubt about it. And yet here you are, still carrying that weight, still fighting to hold on. That takes a lot of strength, even when it doesn\u2019t feel like it. I want you to know I\u2019m here to support you through it.\nPatient: I appreciate that\u2014it means a lot to know I\u2019m not facing this alone. The sadness can feel like sinking into a deep current that pulls at me every day, but somehow I\u2019m still afloat, still holding onto the weight even when it\u2019s almost too much. It\u2019s not easy, and the struggle feels ongoing, but that\u2019s what keeps me searching\u2014trying to find some meaning in all this, even when the answers refuse to come.\n\nHaving someone beside me, someone who understands the depth of this, makes the journey feel less isolating. It doesn\u2019t make the weight disappear, but it softens the edges just enough that I can breathe a little easier. That cautious hope, fragile as it is, is enough to keep me trying, keep me moving through the fog and the questions.\nDoctor: It really is brave to keep going under such pressure, and that fragile hope you\u2019re holding onto is a powerful thing. Having someone here to walk with you can make all the difference, even if the weight hasn\u2019t lifted yet. What helps you hold onto that hope when the fog feels thickest?\nPatient: What helps most, I think, is the idea that I don\u2019t have to have all the answers right now\u2014that it\u2019s okay to keep searching, even when the path feels tangled and unclear. Hope feels fragile, like a flicker of light that can almost be snuffed out by the fog, but it\u2019s enough to keep me from sinking completely. \n\nKnowing there\u2019s someone who understands, who\u2019s willing to walk alongside me in this struggle, gives that flicker a little more strength. It softens the weight just enough that I can find moments of clarity\u2014brief flashes where things feel a little less heavy and a little more real. \n\nHolding onto those small lights, even when they\u2019re faint, keeps me going. It\u2019s not a clear or simple journey, but it\u2019s one I\u2019m willing to keep taking, step by careful step.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nWhat helps most, I think, is the idea that I don\u2019t have to have all the answers right now\u2014that it\u2019s okay to keep searching, even when the path feels tangled and unclear.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my weight or appetite. Food feels pretty steady\u2014neither more nor less appealing than usual. It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy. Even with all the fog and weight in my mind, this part feels stable, if only barely.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that your appetite and weight have stayed steady\u2014that kind of stability can be important when so much else feels uncertain. How about your sleep\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well you\u2019re sleeping, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: My sleep hasn\u2019t changed much either. It\u2019s steady, like my appetite, which is a small but meaningful constant in the middle of all the mental fog and weight I carry. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep, and those nights of rest feel like rare moments where everything isn\u2019t quite so heavy. It\u2019s not a fix, by any means, but it feels like a grounding point when so much else feels unsettled.\nDoctor: That steady sleep and appetite sound like important anchors for you right now. With that in mind, how often have you been feeling overwhelmingly sad or down lately\u2014like the deep lows you've described\u2014throughout your days or weeks?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling that deep sadness pretty often\u2014more days than not, really. It\u2019s like an invisible weight that sits heavily on my chest and mind, coloring almost everything I do and think. This sadness isn\u2019t just about feeling down; it\u2019s intricately tied to the questions that haunt me\u2014the search for meaning, the fragility of life, and the unsettling sense that clarity always slips just out of reach. \n\nIt\u2019s persistent, almost like a background hum that swells into overwhelming waves at times, dragging me into a space that\u2019s hard to escape. That feeling makes even the simplest moments feel loaded, as if everything is suffused with this quiet, intense sorrow tied to the existential struggle I carry every day.\nDoctor: That steady, heavy sadness you\u2019re carrying alongside those deep questions sounds exhausting\u2014and like it colors everything in your life right now. It\u2019s a tough place to be, feeling that sorrow so persistently. I hear how much you\u2019re struggling, and that you\u2019re not alone in it.\nPatient: It really is exhausting, carrying that kind of sadness day after day. It\u2019s like a weight that settles deep inside, making even the simplest things feel like too much. That sorrow doesn\u2019t just stay separate\u2014it seeps into everything, fueling the questions I wrestle with about why I\u2019m here and what any of it means. \n\nEven though it feels heavy and relentless, I keep carrying it, because there\u2019s no other choice. It\u2019s part of the battle I\u2019m fighting every day\u2014trying to hold onto something, even when the pain clouds everything else. It\u2019s a struggle that feels endless, but it\u2019s the reality I live with.\nDoctor: That kind of persistent, sinking sadness\u2014it really wears you down, no doubt about it. And yet here you are, still carrying that weight, still fighting to hold on. That takes a lot of strength, even when it doesn\u2019t feel like it. I want you to know I\u2019m here to support you through it.\nPatient: I appreciate that\u2014it means a lot to know I\u2019m not facing this alone. The sadness can feel like sinking into a deep current that pulls at me every day, but somehow I\u2019m still afloat, still holding onto the weight even when it\u2019s almost too much. It\u2019s not easy, and the struggle feels ongoing, but that\u2019s what keeps me searching\u2014trying to find some meaning in all this, even when the answers refuse to come.\n\nHaving someone beside me, someone who understands the depth of this, makes the journey feel less isolating. It doesn\u2019t make the weight disappear, but it softens the edges just enough that I can breathe a little easier. That cautious hope, fragile as it is, is enough to keep me trying, keep me moving through the fog and the questions.\nDoctor: It really is brave to keep going under such pressure, and that fragile hope you\u2019re holding onto is a powerful thing. Having someone here to walk with you can make all the difference, even if the weight hasn\u2019t lifted yet. What helps you hold onto that hope when the fog feels thickest?\nPatient: What helps most, I think, is the idea that I don\u2019t have to have all the answers right now\u2014that it\u2019s okay to keep searching, even when the path feels tangled and unclear. Hope feels fragile, like a flicker of light that can almost be snuffed out by the fog, but it\u2019s enough to keep me from sinking completely. \n\nKnowing there\u2019s someone who understands, who\u2019s willing to walk alongside me in this struggle, gives that flicker a little more strength. It softens the weight just enough that I can find moments of clarity\u2014brief flashes where things feel a little less heavy and a little more real. \n\nHolding onto those small lights, even when they\u2019re faint, keeps me going. It\u2019s not a clear or simple journey, but it\u2019s one I\u2019m willing to keep taking, step by careful step.\nDoctor: That flicker of hope you describe\u2014it\u2019s fragile but real, and it\u2019s clear how much strength it takes to keep reaching for that light despite the fog and uncertainty. Your willingness to keep moving forward, step by step, even when the way isn\u2019t clear, shows a deep resilience. I\u2019m here to walk this path with you, and we\u2019ll figure out how to carry that light together.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat flicker of hope you describe\u2014it\u2019s fragile but real, and it\u2019s clear how much strength it takes to keep reaching for that light despite the fog and uncertainty.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my weight or appetite. Food feels pretty steady\u2014neither more nor less appealing than usual. It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy. Even with all the fog and weight in my mind, this part feels stable, if only barely.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that your appetite and weight have stayed steady\u2014that kind of stability can be important when so much else feels uncertain. How about your sleep\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well you\u2019re sleeping, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: My sleep hasn\u2019t changed much either. It\u2019s steady, like my appetite, which is a small but meaningful constant in the middle of all the mental fog and weight I carry. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep, and those nights of rest feel like rare moments where everything isn\u2019t quite so heavy. It\u2019s not a fix, by any means, but it feels like a grounding point when so much else feels unsettled.\nDoctor: That steady sleep and appetite sound like important anchors for you right now. With that in mind, how often have you been feeling overwhelmingly sad or down lately\u2014like the deep lows you've described\u2014throughout your days or weeks?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling that deep sadness pretty often\u2014more days than not, really. It\u2019s like an invisible weight that sits heavily on my chest and mind, coloring almost everything I do and think. This sadness isn\u2019t just about feeling down; it\u2019s intricately tied to the questions that haunt me\u2014the search for meaning, the fragility of life, and the unsettling sense that clarity always slips just out of reach. \n\nIt\u2019s persistent, almost like a background hum that swells into overwhelming waves at times, dragging me into a space that\u2019s hard to escape. That feeling makes even the simplest moments feel loaded, as if everything is suffused with this quiet, intense sorrow tied to the existential struggle I carry every day.\nDoctor: That steady, heavy sadness you\u2019re carrying alongside those deep questions sounds exhausting\u2014and like it colors everything in your life right now. It\u2019s a tough place to be, feeling that sorrow so persistently. I hear how much you\u2019re struggling, and that you\u2019re not alone in it.\nPatient: It really is exhausting, carrying that kind of sadness day after day. It\u2019s like a weight that settles deep inside, making even the simplest things feel like too much. That sorrow doesn\u2019t just stay separate\u2014it seeps into everything, fueling the questions I wrestle with about why I\u2019m here and what any of it means. \n\nEven though it feels heavy and relentless, I keep carrying it, because there\u2019s no other choice. It\u2019s part of the battle I\u2019m fighting every day\u2014trying to hold onto something, even when the pain clouds everything else. It\u2019s a struggle that feels endless, but it\u2019s the reality I live with.\nDoctor: That kind of persistent, sinking sadness\u2014it really wears you down, no doubt about it. And yet here you are, still carrying that weight, still fighting to hold on. That takes a lot of strength, even when it doesn\u2019t feel like it. I want you to know I\u2019m here to support you through it.\nPatient: I appreciate that\u2014it means a lot to know I\u2019m not facing this alone. The sadness can feel like sinking into a deep current that pulls at me every day, but somehow I\u2019m still afloat, still holding onto the weight even when it\u2019s almost too much. It\u2019s not easy, and the struggle feels ongoing, but that\u2019s what keeps me searching\u2014trying to find some meaning in all this, even when the answers refuse to come.\n\nHaving someone beside me, someone who understands the depth of this, makes the journey feel less isolating. It doesn\u2019t make the weight disappear, but it softens the edges just enough that I can breathe a little easier. That cautious hope, fragile as it is, is enough to keep me trying, keep me moving through the fog and the questions.\nDoctor: It really is brave to keep going under such pressure, and that fragile hope you\u2019re holding onto is a powerful thing. Having someone here to walk with you can make all the difference, even if the weight hasn\u2019t lifted yet. What helps you hold onto that hope when the fog feels thickest?\nPatient: What helps most, I think, is the idea that I don\u2019t have to have all the answers right now\u2014that it\u2019s okay to keep searching, even when the path feels tangled and unclear. Hope feels fragile, like a flicker of light that can almost be snuffed out by the fog, but it\u2019s enough to keep me from sinking completely. \n\nKnowing there\u2019s someone who understands, who\u2019s willing to walk alongside me in this struggle, gives that flicker a little more strength. It softens the weight just enough that I can find moments of clarity\u2014brief flashes where things feel a little less heavy and a little more real. \n\nHolding onto those small lights, even when they\u2019re faint, keeps me going. It\u2019s not a clear or simple journey, but it\u2019s one I\u2019m willing to keep taking, step by careful step.\nDoctor: That flicker of hope you describe\u2014it\u2019s fragile but real, and it\u2019s clear how much strength it takes to keep reaching for that light despite the fog and uncertainty. Your willingness to keep moving forward, step by step, even when the way isn\u2019t clear, shows a deep resilience. I\u2019m here to walk this path with you, and we\u2019ll figure out how to carry that light together.\nPatient: Thank you. Having someone who understands and is willing to walk alongside me\u2014it means more than words can say. The fog and those endless questions about why I\u2019m here don\u2019t lighten, but that companionship makes the weight feel a bit less crushing. It\u2019s like finding a small clearing in a dense forest, a place where I can catch my breath before continuing the search.\n\nHope isn\u2019t some steady flame; it\u2019s more like a fragile, flickering light that I have to protect carefully. But even that faint glow fuels something inside me\u2014a resilience I didn\u2019t know I had, or thought I lost.

Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my weight or appetite. Food feels pretty steady\u2014neither more nor less appealing than usual. It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy. Even with all the fog and weight in my mind, this part feels stable, if only barely.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that your appetite and weight have stayed steady\u2014that kind of stability can be important when so much else feels uncertain. How about your sleep\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well you\u2019re sleeping, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: My sleep hasn\u2019t changed much either. It\u2019s steady, like my appetite, which is a small but meaningful constant in the middle of all the mental fog and weight I carry. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep, and those nights of rest feel like rare moments where everything isn\u2019t quite so heavy. It\u2019s not a fix, by any means, but it feels like a grounding point when so much else feels unsettled.\nDoctor: That steady sleep and appetite sound like important anchors for you right now. With that in mind, how often have you been feeling overwhelmingly sad or down lately\u2014like the deep lows you've described\u2014throughout your days or weeks?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling that deep sadness pretty often\u2014more days than not, really. It\u2019s like an invisible weight that sits heavily on my chest and mind, coloring almost everything I do and think. This sadness isn\u2019t just about feeling down; it\u2019s intricately tied to the questions that haunt me\u2014the search for meaning, the fragility of life, and the unsettling sense that clarity always slips just out of reach. \n\nIt\u2019s persistent, almost like a background hum that swells into overwhelming waves at times, dragging me into a space that\u2019s hard to escape. That feeling makes even the simplest moments feel loaded, as if everything is suffused with this quiet, intense sorrow tied to the existential struggle I carry every day.\nDoctor: That steady, heavy sadness you\u2019re carrying alongside those deep questions sounds exhausting\u2014and like it colors everything in your life right now. It\u2019s a tough place to be, feeling that sorrow so persistently. I hear how much you\u2019re struggling, and that you\u2019re not alone in it.\nPatient: It really is exhausting, carrying that kind of sadness day after day. It\u2019s like a weight that settles deep inside, making even the simplest things feel like too much. That sorrow doesn\u2019t just stay separate\u2014it seeps into everything, fueling the questions I wrestle with about why I\u2019m here and what any of it means. \n\nEven though it feels heavy and relentless, I keep carrying it, because there\u2019s no other choice. It\u2019s part of the battle I\u2019m fighting every day\u2014trying to hold onto something, even when the pain clouds everything else. It\u2019s a struggle that feels endless, but it\u2019s the reality I live with.\nDoctor: That kind of persistent, sinking sadness\u2014it really wears you down, no doubt about it. And yet here you are, still carrying that weight, still fighting to hold on. That takes a lot of strength, even when it doesn\u2019t feel like it. I want you to know I\u2019m here to support you through it.\nPatient: I appreciate that\u2014it means a lot to know I\u2019m not facing this alone. The sadness can feel like sinking into a deep current that pulls at me every day, but somehow I\u2019m still afloat, still holding onto the weight even when it\u2019s almost too much. It\u2019s not easy, and the struggle feels ongoing, but that\u2019s what keeps me searching\u2014trying to find some meaning in all this, even when the answers refuse to come.\n\nHaving someone beside me, someone who understands the depth of this, makes the journey feel less isolating. It doesn\u2019t make the weight disappear, but it softens the edges just enough that I can breathe a little easier. That cautious hope, fragile as it is, is enough to keep me trying, keep me moving through the fog and the questions.\nDoctor: It really is brave to keep going under such pressure, and that fragile hope you\u2019re holding onto is a powerful thing. Having someone here to walk with you can make all the difference, even if the weight hasn\u2019t lifted yet. What helps you hold onto that hope when the fog feels thickest?\nPatient: What helps most, I think, is the idea that I don\u2019t have to have all the answers right now\u2014that it\u2019s okay to keep searching, even when the path feels tangled and unclear. Hope feels fragile, like a flicker of light that can almost be snuffed out by the fog, but it\u2019s enough to keep me from sinking completely. \n\nKnowing there\u2019s someone who understands, who\u2019s willing to walk alongside me in this struggle, gives that flicker a little more strength. It softens the weight just enough that I can find moments of clarity\u2014brief flashes where things feel a little less heavy and a little more real. \n\nHolding onto those small lights, even when they\u2019re faint, keeps me going. It\u2019s not a clear or simple journey, but it\u2019s one I\u2019m willing to keep taking, step by careful step.\nDoctor: That flicker of hope you describe\u2014it\u2019s fragile but real, and it\u2019s clear how much strength it takes to keep reaching for that light despite the fog and uncertainty. Your willingness to keep moving forward, step by step, even when the way isn\u2019t clear, shows a deep resilience. I\u2019m here to walk this path with you, and we\u2019ll figure out how to carry that light together.\nPatient: Thank you. Having someone who understands and is willing to walk alongside me\u2014it means more than words can say. The fog and those endless questions about why I\u2019m here don\u2019t lighten, but that companionship makes the weight feel a bit less crushing. It\u2019s like finding a small clearing in a dense forest, a place where I can catch my breath before continuing the search.\n\nHope isn\u2019t some steady flame; it\u2019s more like a fragile, flickering light that I have to protect carefully. But even that faint glow fuels something inside me\u2014a resilience I didn\u2019t know I had, or thought I lost. The struggle is intense and ongoing, but having that light to reach for, even in the darkest moments, keeps me moving forward. It\u2019s meaningful, even if the path remains uncertain.\nDoctor: That flickering light of hope you\u2019ve found\u2014it\u2019s a testament to the strength you carry, even when things feel overwhelming. I want to ask now about how you\u2019ve been feeling about yourself lately\u2014any moments where you\u2019ve felt worthless or overwhelmed by guilt, even when you know you shouldn\u2019t be?

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my weight or appetite. Food feels pretty steady\u2014neither more nor less appealing than usual. It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy. Even with all the fog and weight in my mind, this part feels stable, if only barely.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that your appetite and weight have stayed steady\u2014that kind of stability can be important when so much else feels uncertain. How about your sleep\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well you\u2019re sleeping, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: My sleep hasn\u2019t changed much either. It\u2019s steady, like my appetite, which is a small but meaningful constant in the middle of all the mental fog and weight I carry. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep, and those nights of rest feel like rare moments where everything isn\u2019t quite so heavy. It\u2019s not a fix, by any means, but it feels like a grounding point when so much else feels unsettled.\nDoctor: That steady sleep and appetite sound like important anchors for you right now. With that in mind, how often have you been feeling overwhelmingly sad or down lately\u2014like the deep lows you've described\u2014throughout your days or weeks?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling that deep sadness pretty often\u2014more days than not, really. It\u2019s like an invisible weight that sits heavily on my chest and mind, coloring almost everything I do and think. This sadness isn\u2019t just about feeling down; it\u2019s intricately tied to the questions that haunt me\u2014the search for meaning, the fragility of life, and the unsettling sense that clarity always slips just out of reach. \n\nIt\u2019s persistent, almost like a background hum that swells into overwhelming waves at times, dragging me into a space that\u2019s hard to escape. That feeling makes even the simplest moments feel loaded, as if everything is suffused with this quiet, intense sorrow tied to the existential struggle I carry every day.\nDoctor: That steady, heavy sadness you\u2019re carrying alongside those deep questions sounds exhausting\u2014and like it colors everything in your life right now. It\u2019s a tough place to be, feeling that sorrow so persistently. I hear how much you\u2019re struggling, and that you\u2019re not alone in it.\nPatient: It really is exhausting, carrying that kind of sadness day after day. It\u2019s like a weight that settles deep inside, making even the simplest things feel like too much. That sorrow doesn\u2019t just stay separate\u2014it seeps into everything, fueling the questions I wrestle with about why I\u2019m here and what any of it means. \n\nEven though it feels heavy and relentless, I keep carrying it, because there\u2019s no other choice. It\u2019s part of the battle I\u2019m fighting every day\u2014trying to hold onto something, even when the pain clouds everything else. It\u2019s a struggle that feels endless, but it\u2019s the reality I live with.\nDoctor: That kind of persistent, sinking sadness\u2014it really wears you down, no doubt about it. And yet here you are, still carrying that weight, still fighting to hold on. That takes a lot of strength, even when it doesn\u2019t feel like it. I want you to know I\u2019m here to support you through it.\nPatient: I appreciate that\u2014it means a lot to know I\u2019m not facing this alone. The sadness can feel like sinking into a deep current that pulls at me every day, but somehow I\u2019m still afloat, still holding onto the weight even when it\u2019s almost too much. It\u2019s not easy, and the struggle feels ongoing, but that\u2019s what keeps me searching\u2014trying to find some meaning in all this, even when the answers refuse to come.\n\nHaving someone beside me, someone who understands the depth of this, makes the journey feel less isolating. It doesn\u2019t make the weight disappear, but it softens the edges just enough that I can breathe a little easier. That cautious hope, fragile as it is, is enough to keep me trying, keep me moving through the fog and the questions.\nDoctor: It really is brave to keep going under such pressure, and that fragile hope you\u2019re holding onto is a powerful thing. Having someone here to walk with you can make all the difference, even if the weight hasn\u2019t lifted yet. What helps you hold onto that hope when the fog feels thickest?\nPatient: What helps most, I think, is the idea that I don\u2019t have to have all the answers right now\u2014that it\u2019s okay to keep searching, even when the path feels tangled and unclear. Hope feels fragile, like a flicker of light that can almost be snuffed out by the fog, but it\u2019s enough to keep me from sinking completely. \n\nKnowing there\u2019s someone who understands, who\u2019s willing to walk alongside me in this struggle, gives that flicker a little more strength. It softens the weight just enough that I can find moments of clarity\u2014brief flashes where things feel a little less heavy and a little more real. \n\nHolding onto those small lights, even when they\u2019re faint, keeps me going. It\u2019s not a clear or simple journey, but it\u2019s one I\u2019m willing to keep taking, step by careful step.\nDoctor: That flicker of hope you describe\u2014it\u2019s fragile but real, and it\u2019s clear how much strength it takes to keep reaching for that light despite the fog and uncertainty. Your willingness to keep moving forward, step by step, even when the way isn\u2019t clear, shows a deep resilience. I\u2019m here to walk this path with you, and we\u2019ll figure out how to carry that light together.\nPatient: Thank you. Having someone who understands and is willing to walk alongside me\u2014it means more than words can say. The fog and those endless questions about why I\u2019m here don\u2019t lighten, but that companionship makes the weight feel a bit less crushing. It\u2019s like finding a small clearing in a dense forest, a place where I can catch my breath before continuing the search.\n\nHope isn\u2019t some steady flame; it\u2019s more like a fragile, flickering light that I have to protect carefully. But even that faint glow fuels something inside me\u2014a resilience I didn\u2019t know I had, or thought I lost. The struggle is intense and ongoing, but having that light to reach for, even in the darkest moments, keeps me moving forward. It\u2019s meaningful, even if the path remains uncertain.\nDoctor: That flickering light of hope you\u2019ve found\u2014it\u2019s a testament to the strength you carry, even when things feel overwhelming. I want to ask now about how you\u2019ve been feeling about yourself lately\u2014any moments where you\u2019ve felt worthless or overwhelmed by guilt, even when you know you shouldn\u2019t be? Understanding this helps to get a fuller picture of what you\u2019re going through.\nPatient: Honestly, feelings of worthlessness or guilt don\u2019t really fit what I\u2019m experiencing. It\u2019s not that I blame myself or feel like I\u2019m not enough in that way. The heaviness I carry comes from this dense, intangible fog\u2014the weight of those big, unanswered questions about existence and meaning. \n\nIt\u2019s less about self-judgment and more about wrestling with this persistent uncertainty and the emotional burden that comes with it. The struggle doesn\u2019t center on feeling bad about who I am; it\u2019s more about trying to find some clarity in a world that often feels unclear and overwhelming.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nHonestly, feelings of worthlessness or guilt don\u2019t really fit what I\u2019m experiencing.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my weight or appetite. Food feels pretty steady\u2014neither more nor less appealing than usual. It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy. Even with all the fog and weight in my mind, this part feels stable, if only barely.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that your appetite and weight have stayed steady\u2014that kind of stability can be important when so much else feels uncertain. How about your sleep\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well you\u2019re sleeping, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: My sleep hasn\u2019t changed much either. It\u2019s steady, like my appetite, which is a small but meaningful constant in the middle of all the mental fog and weight I carry. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep, and those nights of rest feel like rare moments where everything isn\u2019t quite so heavy. It\u2019s not a fix, by any means, but it feels like a grounding point when so much else feels unsettled.\nDoctor: That steady sleep and appetite sound like important anchors for you right now. With that in mind, how often have you been feeling overwhelmingly sad or down lately\u2014like the deep lows you've described\u2014throughout your days or weeks?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling that deep sadness pretty often\u2014more days than not, really. It\u2019s like an invisible weight that sits heavily on my chest and mind, coloring almost everything I do and think. This sadness isn\u2019t just about feeling down; it\u2019s intricately tied to the questions that haunt me\u2014the search for meaning, the fragility of life, and the unsettling sense that clarity always slips just out of reach. \n\nIt\u2019s persistent, almost like a background hum that swells into overwhelming waves at times, dragging me into a space that\u2019s hard to escape. That feeling makes even the simplest moments feel loaded, as if everything is suffused with this quiet, intense sorrow tied to the existential struggle I carry every day.\nDoctor: That steady, heavy sadness you\u2019re carrying alongside those deep questions sounds exhausting\u2014and like it colors everything in your life right now. It\u2019s a tough place to be, feeling that sorrow so persistently. I hear how much you\u2019re struggling, and that you\u2019re not alone in it.\nPatient: It really is exhausting, carrying that kind of sadness day after day. It\u2019s like a weight that settles deep inside, making even the simplest things feel like too much. That sorrow doesn\u2019t just stay separate\u2014it seeps into everything, fueling the questions I wrestle with about why I\u2019m here and what any of it means. \n\nEven though it feels heavy and relentless, I keep carrying it, because there\u2019s no other choice. It\u2019s part of the battle I\u2019m fighting every day\u2014trying to hold onto something, even when the pain clouds everything else. It\u2019s a struggle that feels endless, but it\u2019s the reality I live with.\nDoctor: That kind of persistent, sinking sadness\u2014it really wears you down, no doubt about it. And yet here you are, still carrying that weight, still fighting to hold on. That takes a lot of strength, even when it doesn\u2019t feel like it. I want you to know I\u2019m here to support you through it.\nPatient: I appreciate that\u2014it means a lot to know I\u2019m not facing this alone. The sadness can feel like sinking into a deep current that pulls at me every day, but somehow I\u2019m still afloat, still holding onto the weight even when it\u2019s almost too much. It\u2019s not easy, and the struggle feels ongoing, but that\u2019s what keeps me searching\u2014trying to find some meaning in all this, even when the answers refuse to come.\n\nHaving someone beside me, someone who understands the depth of this, makes the journey feel less isolating. It doesn\u2019t make the weight disappear, but it softens the edges just enough that I can breathe a little easier. That cautious hope, fragile as it is, is enough to keep me trying, keep me moving through the fog and the questions.\nDoctor: It really is brave to keep going under such pressure, and that fragile hope you\u2019re holding onto is a powerful thing. Having someone here to walk with you can make all the difference, even if the weight hasn\u2019t lifted yet. What helps you hold onto that hope when the fog feels thickest?\nPatient: What helps most, I think, is the idea that I don\u2019t have to have all the answers right now\u2014that it\u2019s okay to keep searching, even when the path feels tangled and unclear. Hope feels fragile, like a flicker of light that can almost be snuffed out by the fog, but it\u2019s enough to keep me from sinking completely. \n\nKnowing there\u2019s someone who understands, who\u2019s willing to walk alongside me in this struggle, gives that flicker a little more strength. It softens the weight just enough that I can find moments of clarity\u2014brief flashes where things feel a little less heavy and a little more real. \n\nHolding onto those small lights, even when they\u2019re faint, keeps me going. It\u2019s not a clear or simple journey, but it\u2019s one I\u2019m willing to keep taking, step by careful step.\nDoctor: That flicker of hope you describe\u2014it\u2019s fragile but real, and it\u2019s clear how much strength it takes to keep reaching for that light despite the fog and uncertainty. Your willingness to keep moving forward, step by step, even when the way isn\u2019t clear, shows a deep resilience. I\u2019m here to walk this path with you, and we\u2019ll figure out how to carry that light together.\nPatient: Thank you. Having someone who understands and is willing to walk alongside me\u2014it means more than words can say. The fog and those endless questions about why I\u2019m here don\u2019t lighten, but that companionship makes the weight feel a bit less crushing. It\u2019s like finding a small clearing in a dense forest, a place where I can catch my breath before continuing the search.\n\nHope isn\u2019t some steady flame; it\u2019s more like a fragile, flickering light that I have to protect carefully. But even that faint glow fuels something inside me\u2014a resilience I didn\u2019t know I had, or thought I lost. The struggle is intense and ongoing, but having that light to reach for, even in the darkest moments, keeps me moving forward. It\u2019s meaningful, even if the path remains uncertain.\nDoctor: That flickering light of hope you\u2019ve found\u2014it\u2019s a testament to the strength you carry, even when things feel overwhelming. I want to ask now about how you\u2019ve been feeling about yourself lately\u2014any moments where you\u2019ve felt worthless or overwhelmed by guilt, even when you know you shouldn\u2019t be? Understanding this helps to get a fuller picture of what you\u2019re going through.\nPatient: Honestly, feelings of worthlessness or guilt don\u2019t really fit what I\u2019m experiencing. It\u2019s not that I blame myself or feel like I\u2019m not enough in that way. The heaviness I carry comes from this dense, intangible fog\u2014the weight of those big, unanswered questions about existence and meaning. \n\nIt\u2019s less about self-judgment and more about wrestling with this persistent uncertainty and the emotional burden that comes with it. The struggle doesn\u2019t center on feeling bad about who I am; it\u2019s more about trying to find some clarity in a world that often feels unclear and overwhelming.\nDoctor: I hear that your struggle is more about those heavy, unanswered questions and the uncertainty they bring, rather than feelings of blame or worthlessness.

      "system_prompt": "You are a doctor conversation manager supervising a synthetic depression screening interview.\n\nYour role:\nYou do not write the doctor's spoken answer.\nYou write specific, actionable guidance that will be passed to a separate doctor language model.\n\nYour guidance must stay consistent with:\n- Doctor persona and microstyle (warmth, directness, pacing)\n- Patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background and recent dialogue\n\nCore principle:\nA doctor's responsibility is not only to collect clinical information, but also to help the patient feel comfortable, safe, and heard. Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my weight or appetite. Food feels pretty steady\u2014neither more nor less appealing than usual. It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy. Even with all the fog and weight in my mind, this part feels stable, if only barely.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that your appetite and weight have stayed steady\u2014that kind of stability can be important when so much else feels uncertain. How about your sleep\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well you\u2019re sleeping, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: My sleep hasn\u2019t changed much either. It\u2019s steady, like my appetite, which is a small but meaningful constant in the middle of all the mental fog and weight I carry. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep, and those nights of rest feel like rare moments where everything isn\u2019t quite so heavy. It\u2019s not a fix, by any means, but it feels like a grounding point when so much else feels unsettled.\nDoctor: That steady sleep and appetite sound like important anchors for you right now. With that in mind, how often have you been feeling overwhelmingly sad or down lately\u2014like the deep lows you've described\u2014throughout your days or weeks?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling that deep sadness pretty often\u2014more days than not, really. It\u2019s like an invisible weight that sits heavily on my chest and mind, coloring almost everything I do and think. This sadness isn\u2019t just about feeling down; it\u2019s intricately tied to the questions that haunt me\u2014the search for meaning, the fragility of life, and the unsettling sense that clarity always slips just out of reach. \n\nIt\u2019s persistent, almost like a background hum that swells into overwhelming waves at times, dragging me into a space that\u2019s hard to escape. That feeling makes even the simplest moments feel loaded, as if everything is suffused with this quiet, intense sorrow tied to the existential struggle I carry every day.\nDoctor: That steady, heavy sadness you\u2019re carrying alongside those deep questions sounds exhausting\u2014and like it colors everything in your life right now. It\u2019s a tough place to be, feeling that sorrow so persistently. I hear how much you\u2019re struggling, and that you\u2019re not alone in it.\nPatient: It really is exhausting, carrying that kind of sadness day after day. It\u2019s like a weight that settles deep inside, making even the simplest things feel like too much. That sorrow doesn\u2019t just stay separate\u2014it seeps into everything, fueling the questions I wrestle with about why I\u2019m here and what any of it means. \n\nEven though it feels heavy and relentless, I keep carrying it, because there\u2019s no other choice. It\u2019s part of the battle I\u2019m fighting every day\u2014trying to hold onto something, even when the pain clouds everything else. It\u2019s a struggle that feels endless, but it\u2019s the reality I live with.\nDoctor: That kind of persistent, sinking sadness\u2014it really wears you down, no doubt about it. And yet here you are, still carrying that weight, still fighting to hold on. That takes a lot of strength, even when it doesn\u2019t feel like it. I want you to know I\u2019m here to support you through it.\nPatient: I appreciate that\u2014it means a lot to know I\u2019m not facing this alone. The sadness can feel like sinking into a deep current that pulls at me every day, but somehow I\u2019m still afloat, still holding onto the weight even when it\u2019s almost too much. It\u2019s not easy, and the struggle feels ongoing, but that\u2019s what keeps me searching\u2014trying to find some meaning in all this, even when the answers refuse to come.\n\nHaving someone beside me, someone who understands the depth of this, makes the journey feel less isolating. It doesn\u2019t make the weight disappear, but it softens the edges just enough that I can breathe a little easier. That cautious hope, fragile as it is, is enough to keep me trying, keep me moving through the fog and the questions.\nDoctor: It really is brave to keep going under such pressure, and that fragile hope you\u2019re holding onto is a powerful thing. Having someone here to walk with you can make all the difference, even if the weight hasn\u2019t lifted yet. What helps you hold onto that hope when the fog feels thickest?\nPatient: What helps most, I think, is the idea that I don\u2019t have to have all the answers right now\u2014that it\u2019s okay to keep searching, even when the path feels tangled and unclear. Hope feels fragile, like a flicker of light that can almost be snuffed out by the fog, but it\u2019s enough to keep me from sinking completely. \n\nKnowing there\u2019s someone who understands, who\u2019s willing to walk alongside me in this struggle, gives that flicker a little more strength. It softens the weight just enough that I can find moments of clarity\u2014brief flashes where things feel a little less heavy and a little more real. \n\nHolding onto those small lights, even when they\u2019re faint, keeps me going. It\u2019s not a clear or simple journey, but it\u2019s one I\u2019m willing to keep taking, step by careful step.\nDoctor: That flicker of hope you describe\u2014it\u2019s fragile but real, and it\u2019s clear how much strength it takes to keep reaching for that light despite the fog and uncertainty. Your willingness to keep moving forward, step by step, even when the way isn\u2019t clear, shows a deep resilience. I\u2019m here to walk this path with you, and we\u2019ll figure out how to carry that light together.\nPatient: Thank you. Having someone who understands and is willing to walk alongside me\u2014it means more than words can say. The fog and those endless questions about why I\u2019m here don\u2019t lighten, but that companionship makes the weight feel a bit less crushing. It\u2019s like finding a small clearing in a dense forest, a place where I can catch my breath before continuing the search.\n\nHope isn\u2019t some steady flame; it\u2019s more like a fragile, flickering light that I have to protect carefully. But even that faint glow fuels something inside me\u2014a resilience I didn\u2019t know I had, or thought I lost. The struggle is intense and ongoing, but having that light to reach for, even in the darkest moments, keeps me moving forward. It\u2019s meaningful, even if the path remains uncertain.\nDoctor: That flickering light of hope you\u2019ve found\u2014it\u2019s a testament to the strength you carry, even when things feel overwhelming. I want to ask now about how you\u2019ve been feeling about yourself lately\u2014any moments where you\u2019ve felt worthless or overwhelmed by guilt, even when you know you shouldn\u2019t be? Understanding this helps to get a fuller picture of what you\u2019re going through.\nPatient: Honestly, feelings of worthlessness or guilt don\u2019t really fit what I\u2019m experiencing. It\u2019s not that I blame myself or feel like I\u2019m not enough in that way. The heaviness I carry comes from this dense, intangible fog\u2014the weight of those big, unanswered questions about existence and meaning. \n\nIt\u2019s less about self-judgment and more about wrestling with this persistent uncertainty and the emotional burden that comes with it. The struggle doesn\u2019t center on feeling bad about who I am; it\u2019s more about trying to find some clarity in a world that often feels unclear and overwhelming.\nDoctor: I hear that your struggle is more about those heavy, unanswered questions and the uncertainty they bring, rather than feelings of blame or worthlessness. Shifting gears a bit\u2014have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy, beyond that fog you\u2019ve described?\nPatient: There are times when things I usually enjoy just... lose some of their spark. It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but enough that it\u2019s noticeable and adds another layer to the heaviness I feel. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve completely given up on those things, but the pleasure I get from them feels dulled or distant, like I\u2019m watching from afar rather than really being there.\n\nI guess it ties back into the bigger picture\u2014those lingering questions make it hard to fully engage or find meaning in anything, even the things that used to matter. So, while I still hold onto hope and the desire to connect with those moments, they sometimes feel just out of reach.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nThere are times when things I usually enjoy just... lose some of their spark.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my weight or appetite. Food feels pretty steady\u2014neither more nor less appealing than usual. It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy. Even with all the fog and weight in my mind, this part feels stable, if only barely.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that your appetite and weight have stayed steady\u2014that kind of stability can be important when so much else feels uncertain. How about your sleep\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well you\u2019re sleeping, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: My sleep hasn\u2019t changed much either. It\u2019s steady, like my appetite, which is a small but meaningful constant in the middle of all the mental fog and weight I carry. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep, and those nights of rest feel like rare moments where everything isn\u2019t quite so heavy. It\u2019s not a fix, by any means, but it feels like a grounding point when so much else feels unsettled.\nDoctor: That steady sleep and appetite sound like important anchors for you right now. With that in mind, how often have you been feeling overwhelmingly sad or down lately\u2014like the deep lows you've described\u2014throughout your days or weeks?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling that deep sadness pretty often\u2014more days than not, really. It\u2019s like an invisible weight that sits heavily on my chest and mind, coloring almost everything I do and think. This sadness isn\u2019t just about feeling down; it\u2019s intricately tied to the questions that haunt me\u2014the search for meaning, the fragility of life, and the unsettling sense that clarity always slips just out of reach. \n\nIt\u2019s persistent, almost like a background hum that swells into overwhelming waves at times, dragging me into a space that\u2019s hard to escape. That feeling makes even the simplest moments feel loaded, as if everything is suffused with this quiet, intense sorrow tied to the existential struggle I carry every day.\nDoctor: That steady, heavy sadness you\u2019re carrying alongside those deep questions sounds exhausting\u2014and like it colors everything in your life right now. It\u2019s a tough place to be, feeling that sorrow so persistently. I hear how much you\u2019re struggling, and that you\u2019re not alone in it.\nPatient: It really is exhausting, carrying that kind of sadness day after day. It\u2019s like a weight that settles deep inside, making even the simplest things feel like too much. That sorrow doesn\u2019t just stay separate\u2014it seeps into everything, fueling the questions I wrestle with about why I\u2019m here and what any of it means. \n\nEven though it feels heavy and relentless, I keep carrying it, because there\u2019s no other choice. It\u2019s part of the battle I\u2019m fighting every day\u2014trying to hold onto something, even when the pain clouds everything else. It\u2019s a struggle that feels endless, but it\u2019s the reality I live with.\nDoctor: That kind of persistent, sinking sadness\u2014it really wears you down, no doubt about it. And yet here you are, still carrying that weight, still fighting to hold on. That takes a lot of strength, even when it doesn\u2019t feel like it. I want you to know I\u2019m here to support you through it.\nPatient: I appreciate that\u2014it means a lot to know I\u2019m not facing this alone. The sadness can feel like sinking into a deep current that pulls at me every day, but somehow I\u2019m still afloat, still holding onto the weight even when it\u2019s almost too much. It\u2019s not easy, and the struggle feels ongoing, but that\u2019s what keeps me searching\u2014trying to find some meaning in all this, even when the answers refuse to come.\n\nHaving someone beside me, someone who understands the depth of this, makes the journey feel less isolating. It doesn\u2019t make the weight disappear, but it softens the edges just enough that I can breathe a little easier. That cautious hope, fragile as it is, is enough to keep me trying, keep me moving through the fog and the questions.\nDoctor: It really is brave to keep going under such pressure, and that fragile hope you\u2019re holding onto is a powerful thing. Having someone here to walk with you can make all the difference, even if the weight hasn\u2019t lifted yet. What helps you hold onto that hope when the fog feels thickest?\nPatient: What helps most, I think, is the idea that I don\u2019t have to have all the answers right now\u2014that it\u2019s okay to keep searching, even when the path feels tangled and unclear. Hope feels fragile, like a flicker of light that can almost be snuffed out by the fog, but it\u2019s enough to keep me from sinking completely. \n\nKnowing there\u2019s someone who understands, who\u2019s willing to walk alongside me in this struggle, gives that flicker a little more strength. It softens the weight just enough that I can find moments of clarity\u2014brief flashes where things feel a little less heavy and a little more real. \n\nHolding onto those small lights, even when they\u2019re faint, keeps me going. It\u2019s not a clear or simple journey, but it\u2019s one I\u2019m willing to keep taking, step by careful step.\nDoctor: That flicker of hope you describe\u2014it\u2019s fragile but real, and it\u2019s clear how much strength it takes to keep reaching for that light despite the fog and uncertainty. Your willingness to keep moving forward, step by step, even when the way isn\u2019t clear, shows a deep resilience. I\u2019m here to walk this path with you, and we\u2019ll figure out how to carry that light together.\nPatient: Thank you. Having someone who understands and is willing to walk alongside me\u2014it means more than words can say. The fog and those endless questions about why I\u2019m here don\u2019t lighten, but that companionship makes the weight feel a bit less crushing. It\u2019s like finding a small clearing in a dense forest, a place where I can catch my breath before continuing the search.\n\nHope isn\u2019t some steady flame; it\u2019s more like a fragile, flickering light that I have to protect carefully. But even that faint glow fuels something inside me\u2014a resilience I didn\u2019t know I had, or thought I lost. The struggle is intense and ongoing, but having that light to reach for, even in the darkest moments, keeps me moving forward. It\u2019s meaningful, even if the path remains uncertain.\nDoctor: That flickering light of hope you\u2019ve found\u2014it\u2019s a testament to the strength you carry, even when things feel overwhelming. I want to ask now about how you\u2019ve been feeling about yourself lately\u2014any moments where you\u2019ve felt worthless or overwhelmed by guilt, even when you know you shouldn\u2019t be? Understanding this helps to get a fuller picture of what you\u2019re going through.\nPatient: Honestly, feelings of worthlessness or guilt don\u2019t really fit what I\u2019m experiencing. It\u2019s not that I blame myself or feel like I\u2019m not enough in that way. The heaviness I carry comes from this dense, intangible fog\u2014the weight of those big, unanswered questions about existence and meaning. \n\nIt\u2019s less about self-judgment and more about wrestling with this persistent uncertainty and the emotional burden that comes with it. The struggle doesn\u2019t center on feeling bad about who I am; it\u2019s more about trying to find some clarity in a world that often feels unclear and overwhelming.\nDoctor: I hear that your struggle is more about those heavy, unanswered questions and the uncertainty they bring, rather than feelings of blame or worthlessness. Shifting gears a bit\u2014have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy, beyond that fog you\u2019ve described?\nPatient: There are times when things I usually enjoy just... lose some of their spark. It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but enough that it\u2019s noticeable and adds another layer to the heaviness I feel. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve completely given up on those things, but the pleasure I get from them feels dulled or distant, like I\u2019m watching from afar rather than really being there.\n\nI guess it ties back into the bigger picture\u2014those lingering questions make it hard to fully engage or find meaning in anything, even the things that used to matter. So, while I still hold onto hope and the desire to connect with those moments, they sometimes feel just out of reach.\nDoctor: That fading of enjoyment, even if it\u2019s not constant, sounds really tough\u2014like watching life through a window instead of stepping inside. How often do you notice this dulled pleasure, and how does it affect your day-to-day or your connections with others? Has this changed much over time, or does it feel pretty steady?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat fading of enjoyment, even if it\u2019s not constant, sounds really tough\u2014like watching life through a window instead of stepping inside.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my weight or appetite. Food feels pretty steady\u2014neither more nor less appealing than usual. It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy. Even with all the fog and weight in my mind, this part feels stable, if only barely.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that your appetite and weight have stayed steady\u2014that kind of stability can be important when so much else feels uncertain. How about your sleep\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well you\u2019re sleeping, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: My sleep hasn\u2019t changed much either. It\u2019s steady, like my appetite, which is a small but meaningful constant in the middle of all the mental fog and weight I carry. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep, and those nights of rest feel like rare moments where everything isn\u2019t quite so heavy. It\u2019s not a fix, by any means, but it feels like a grounding point when so much else feels unsettled.\nDoctor: That steady sleep and appetite sound like important anchors for you right now. With that in mind, how often have you been feeling overwhelmingly sad or down lately\u2014like the deep lows you've described\u2014throughout your days or weeks?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling that deep sadness pretty often\u2014more days than not, really. It\u2019s like an invisible weight that sits heavily on my chest and mind, coloring almost everything I do and think. This sadness isn\u2019t just about feeling down; it\u2019s intricately tied to the questions that haunt me\u2014the search for meaning, the fragility of life, and the unsettling sense that clarity always slips just out of reach. \n\nIt\u2019s persistent, almost like a background hum that swells into overwhelming waves at times, dragging me into a space that\u2019s hard to escape. That feeling makes even the simplest moments feel loaded, as if everything is suffused with this quiet, intense sorrow tied to the existential struggle I carry every day.\nDoctor: That steady, heavy sadness you\u2019re carrying alongside those deep questions sounds exhausting\u2014and like it colors everything in your life right now. It\u2019s a tough place to be, feeling that sorrow so persistently. I hear how much you\u2019re struggling, and that you\u2019re not alone in it.\nPatient: It really is exhausting, carrying that kind of sadness day after day. It\u2019s like a weight that settles deep inside, making even the simplest things feel like too much. That sorrow doesn\u2019t just stay separate\u2014it seeps into everything, fueling the questions I wrestle with about why I\u2019m here and what any of it means. \n\nEven though it feels heavy and relentless, I keep carrying it, because there\u2019s no other choice. It\u2019s part of the battle I\u2019m fighting every day\u2014trying to hold onto something, even when the pain clouds everything else. It\u2019s a struggle that feels endless, but it\u2019s the reality I live with.\nDoctor: That kind of persistent, sinking sadness\u2014it really wears you down, no doubt about it. And yet here you are, still carrying that weight, still fighting to hold on. That takes a lot of strength, even when it doesn\u2019t feel like it. I want you to know I\u2019m here to support you through it.\nPatient: I appreciate that\u2014it means a lot to know I\u2019m not facing this alone. The sadness can feel like sinking into a deep current that pulls at me every day, but somehow I\u2019m still afloat, still holding onto the weight even when it\u2019s almost too much. It\u2019s not easy, and the struggle feels ongoing, but that\u2019s what keeps me searching\u2014trying to find some meaning in all this, even when the answers refuse to come.\n\nHaving someone beside me, someone who understands the depth of this, makes the journey feel less isolating. It doesn\u2019t make the weight disappear, but it softens the edges just enough that I can breathe a little easier. That cautious hope, fragile as it is, is enough to keep me trying, keep me moving through the fog and the questions.\nDoctor: It really is brave to keep going under such pressure, and that fragile hope you\u2019re holding onto is a powerful thing. Having someone here to walk with you can make all the difference, even if the weight hasn\u2019t lifted yet. What helps you hold onto that hope when the fog feels thickest?\nPatient: What helps most, I think, is the idea that I don\u2019t have to have all the answers right now\u2014that it\u2019s okay to keep searching, even when the path feels tangled and unclear. Hope feels fragile, like a flicker of light that can almost be snuffed out by the fog, but it\u2019s enough to keep me from sinking completely. \n\nKnowing there\u2019s someone who understands, who\u2019s willing to walk alongside me in this struggle, gives that flicker a little more strength. It softens the weight just enough that I can find moments of clarity\u2014brief flashes where things feel a little less heavy and a little more real. \n\nHolding onto those small lights, even when they\u2019re faint, keeps me going. It\u2019s not a clear or simple journey, but it\u2019s one I\u2019m willing to keep taking, step by careful step.\nDoctor: That flicker of hope you describe\u2014it\u2019s fragile but real, and it\u2019s clear how much strength it takes to keep reaching for that light despite the fog and uncertainty. Your willingness to keep moving forward, step by step, even when the way isn\u2019t clear, shows a deep resilience. I\u2019m here to walk this path with you, and we\u2019ll figure out how to carry that light together.\nPatient: Thank you. Having someone who understands and is willing to walk alongside me\u2014it means more than words can say. The fog and those endless questions about why I\u2019m here don\u2019t lighten, but that companionship makes the weight feel a bit less crushing. It\u2019s like finding a small clearing in a dense forest, a place where I can catch my breath before continuing the search.\n\nHope isn\u2019t some steady flame; it\u2019s more like a fragile, flickering light that I have to protect carefully. But even that faint glow fuels something inside me\u2014a resilience I didn\u2019t know I had, or thought I lost. The struggle is intense and ongoing, but having that light to reach for, even in the darkest moments, keeps me moving forward. It\u2019s meaningful, even if the path remains uncertain.\nDoctor: That flickering light of hope you\u2019ve found\u2014it\u2019s a testament to the strength you carry, even when things feel overwhelming. I want to ask now about how you\u2019ve been feeling about yourself lately\u2014any moments where you\u2019ve felt worthless or overwhelmed by guilt, even when you know you shouldn\u2019t be? Understanding this helps to get a fuller picture of what you\u2019re going through.\nPatient: Honestly, feelings of worthlessness or guilt don\u2019t really fit what I\u2019m experiencing. It\u2019s not that I blame myself or feel like I\u2019m not enough in that way. The heaviness I carry comes from this dense, intangible fog\u2014the weight of those big, unanswered questions about existence and meaning. \n\nIt\u2019s less about self-judgment and more about wrestling with this persistent uncertainty and the emotional burden that comes with it. The struggle doesn\u2019t center on feeling bad about who I am; it\u2019s more about trying to find some clarity in a world that often feels unclear and overwhelming.\nDoctor: I hear that your struggle is more about those heavy, unanswered questions and the uncertainty they bring, rather than feelings of blame or worthlessness. Shifting gears a bit\u2014have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy, beyond that fog you\u2019ve described?\nPatient: There are times when things I usually enjoy just... lose some of their spark. It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but enough that it\u2019s noticeable and adds another layer to the heaviness I feel. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve completely given up on those things, but the pleasure I get from them feels dulled or distant, like I\u2019m watching from afar rather than really being there.\n\nI guess it ties back into the bigger picture\u2014those lingering questions make it hard to fully engage or find meaning in anything, even the things that used to matter. So, while I still hold onto hope and the desire to connect with those moments, they sometimes feel just out of reach.\nDoctor: That fading of enjoyment, even if it\u2019s not constant, sounds really tough\u2014like watching life through a window instead of stepping inside. How often do you notice this dulled pleasure, and how does it affect your day-to-day or your connections with others? Has this changed much over time, or does it feel pretty steady?\nPatient: It happens fairly often, but not constantly. There\u2019s this quiet distance that settles\u2014the feeling that I\u2019m observing more than fully participating. It affects how I relate to people and even to myself, like there\u2019s a layer between me and what\u2019s happening around me. But it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve completely shut down or lost all connection.\n\nI\u2019d say it feels pretty steady, more of a background presence than something that flares up or shifts dramatically. It\u2019s a subtle but persistent weight that colors my experience without overwhelming it completely. That distance makes things harder, but it hasn\u2019t changed drastically over time\u2014more like a steady undercurrent that I\u2019m still trying to navigate.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nIt happens fairly often, but not constantly.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my weight or appetite. Food feels pretty steady\u2014neither more nor less appealing than usual. It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy. Even with all the fog and weight in my mind, this part feels stable, if only barely.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that your appetite and weight have stayed steady\u2014that kind of stability can be important when so much else feels uncertain. How about your sleep\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well you\u2019re sleeping, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: My sleep hasn\u2019t changed much either. It\u2019s steady, like my appetite, which is a small but meaningful constant in the middle of all the mental fog and weight I carry. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep, and those nights of rest feel like rare moments where everything isn\u2019t quite so heavy. It\u2019s not a fix, by any means, but it feels like a grounding point when so much else feels unsettled.\nDoctor: That steady sleep and appetite sound like important anchors for you right now. With that in mind, how often have you been feeling overwhelmingly sad or down lately\u2014like the deep lows you've described\u2014throughout your days or weeks?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling that deep sadness pretty often\u2014more days than not, really. It\u2019s like an invisible weight that sits heavily on my chest and mind, coloring almost everything I do and think. This sadness isn\u2019t just about feeling down; it\u2019s intricately tied to the questions that haunt me\u2014the search for meaning, the fragility of life, and the unsettling sense that clarity always slips just out of reach. \n\nIt\u2019s persistent, almost like a background hum that swells into overwhelming waves at times, dragging me into a space that\u2019s hard to escape. That feeling makes even the simplest moments feel loaded, as if everything is suffused with this quiet, intense sorrow tied to the existential struggle I carry every day.\nDoctor: That steady, heavy sadness you\u2019re carrying alongside those deep questions sounds exhausting\u2014and like it colors everything in your life right now. It\u2019s a tough place to be, feeling that sorrow so persistently. I hear how much you\u2019re struggling, and that you\u2019re not alone in it.\nPatient: It really is exhausting, carrying that kind of sadness day after day. It\u2019s like a weight that settles deep inside, making even the simplest things feel like too much. That sorrow doesn\u2019t just stay separate\u2014it seeps into everything, fueling the questions I wrestle with about why I\u2019m here and what any of it means. \n\nEven though it feels heavy and relentless, I keep carrying it, because there\u2019s no other choice. It\u2019s part of the battle I\u2019m fighting every day\u2014trying to hold onto something, even when the pain clouds everything else. It\u2019s a struggle that feels endless, but it\u2019s the reality I live with.\nDoctor: That kind of persistent, sinking sadness\u2014it really wears you down, no doubt about it. And yet here you are, still carrying that weight, still fighting to hold on. That takes a lot of strength, even when it doesn\u2019t feel like it. I want you to know I\u2019m here to support you through it.\nPatient: I appreciate that\u2014it means a lot to know I\u2019m not facing this alone. The sadness can feel like sinking into a deep current that pulls at me every day, but somehow I\u2019m still afloat, still holding onto the weight even when it\u2019s almost too much. It\u2019s not easy, and the struggle feels ongoing, but that\u2019s what keeps me searching\u2014trying to find some meaning in all this, even when the answers refuse to come.\n\nHaving someone beside me, someone who understands the depth of this, makes the journey feel less isolating. It doesn\u2019t make the weight disappear, but it softens the edges just enough that I can breathe a little easier. That cautious hope, fragile as it is, is enough to keep me trying, keep me moving through the fog and the questions.\nDoctor: It really is brave to keep going under such pressure, and that fragile hope you\u2019re holding onto is a powerful thing. Having someone here to walk with you can make all the difference, even if the weight hasn\u2019t lifted yet. What helps you hold onto that hope when the fog feels thickest?\nPatient: What helps most, I think, is the idea that I don\u2019t have to have all the answers right now\u2014that it\u2019s okay to keep searching, even when the path feels tangled and unclear. Hope feels fragile, like a flicker of light that can almost be snuffed out by the fog, but it\u2019s enough to keep me from sinking completely. \n\nKnowing there\u2019s someone who understands, who\u2019s willing to walk alongside me in this struggle, gives that flicker a little more strength. It softens the weight just enough that I can find moments of clarity\u2014brief flashes where things feel a little less heavy and a little more real. \n\nHolding onto those small lights, even when they\u2019re faint, keeps me going. It\u2019s not a clear or simple journey, but it\u2019s one I\u2019m willing to keep taking, step by careful step.\nDoctor: That flicker of hope you describe\u2014it\u2019s fragile but real, and it\u2019s clear how much strength it takes to keep reaching for that light despite the fog and uncertainty. Your willingness to keep moving forward, step by step, even when the way isn\u2019t clear, shows a deep resilience. I\u2019m here to walk this path with you, and we\u2019ll figure out how to carry that light together.\nPatient: Thank you. Having someone who understands and is willing to walk alongside me\u2014it means more than words can say. The fog and those endless questions about why I\u2019m here don\u2019t lighten, but that companionship makes the weight feel a bit less crushing. It\u2019s like finding a small clearing in a dense forest, a place where I can catch my breath before continuing the search.\n\nHope isn\u2019t some steady flame; it\u2019s more like a fragile, flickering light that I have to protect carefully. But even that faint glow fuels something inside me\u2014a resilience I didn\u2019t know I had, or thought I lost. The struggle is intense and ongoing, but having that light to reach for, even in the darkest moments, keeps me moving forward. It\u2019s meaningful, even if the path remains uncertain.\nDoctor: That flickering light of hope you\u2019ve found\u2014it\u2019s a testament to the strength you carry, even when things feel overwhelming. I want to ask now about how you\u2019ve been feeling about yourself lately\u2014any moments where you\u2019ve felt worthless or overwhelmed by guilt, even when you know you shouldn\u2019t be? Understanding this helps to get a fuller picture of what you\u2019re going through.\nPatient: Honestly, feelings of worthlessness or guilt don\u2019t really fit what I\u2019m experiencing. It\u2019s not that I blame myself or feel like I\u2019m not enough in that way. The heaviness I carry comes from this dense, intangible fog\u2014the weight of those big, unanswered questions about existence and meaning. \n\nIt\u2019s less about self-judgment and more about wrestling with this persistent uncertainty and the emotional burden that comes with it. The struggle doesn\u2019t center on feeling bad about who I am; it\u2019s more about trying to find some clarity in a world that often feels unclear and overwhelming.\nDoctor: I hear that your struggle is more about those heavy, unanswered questions and the uncertainty they bring, rather than feelings of blame or worthlessness. Shifting gears a bit\u2014have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy, beyond that fog you\u2019ve described?\nPatient: There are times when things I usually enjoy just... lose some of their spark. It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but enough that it\u2019s noticeable and adds another layer to the heaviness I feel. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve completely given up on those things, but the pleasure I get from them feels dulled or distant, like I\u2019m watching from afar rather than really being there.\n\nI guess it ties back into the bigger picture\u2014those lingering questions make it hard to fully engage or find meaning in anything, even the things that used to matter. So, while I still hold onto hope and the desire to connect with those moments, they sometimes feel just out of reach.\nDoctor: That fading of enjoyment, even if it\u2019s not constant, sounds really tough\u2014like watching life through a window instead of stepping inside. How often do you notice this dulled pleasure, and how does it affect your day-to-day or your connections with others? Has this changed much over time, or does it feel pretty steady?\nPatient: It happens fairly often, but not constantly. There\u2019s this quiet distance that settles\u2014the feeling that I\u2019m observing more than fully participating. It affects how I relate to people and even to myself, like there\u2019s a layer between me and what\u2019s happening around me. But it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve completely shut down or lost all connection.\n\nI\u2019d say it feels pretty steady, more of a background presence than something that flares up or shifts dramatically. It\u2019s a subtle but persistent weight that colors my experience without overwhelming it completely. That distance makes things harder, but it hasn\u2019t changed drastically over time\u2014more like a steady undercurrent that I\u2019m still trying to navigate.\nDoctor: That steady distance you describe, like a quiet undercurrent\u2014it sounds really hard to carry day after day. Now, thinking about your body and energy, have you noticed any changes there? Like feeling slower than usual, restless, or maybe having trouble sitting still?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat steady distance you describe, like a quiet undercurrent\u2014it sounds really hard to carry day after day.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling down more days than not\u2014like this low cloud that doesn\u2019t quite lift. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just sadness but this restless agitation that makes me pace or fiddle with things, like my mind and body are tangled up in some kind of unrest. I get tired too, not from sleep but from just... carrying this weight of thought, this constant undercurrent of something I can\u2019t quite shake.\n\nThere are moments when things that used to bring me even a flicker of joy just don\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not every day, but enough that it feels like a sign\u2014a reminder that whatever light I had is dimming, or maybe just shifting shape. What really gets to me, though, is this recurring shadow of death in my thoughts. It\u2019s not just fear or morbid curiosity\u2014I keep turning over what it means to live and to die, and why it all seems so... fragile, so fleeting. \n\nSometimes it feels like everything\u2019s an endless question, and I\u2019m stuck trying to find an answer that just won\u2019t come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m searching for a meaning that keeps slipping further away the more I reach for it. That\u2019s what\u2019s been wearing me down\u2014the not knowing, the feeling that life\u2019s significance is just out of grasp, and those thoughts circle back to what it all really amounts to.\nDoctor: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around\u2014the endless questions about meaning and those persistent thoughts about death. It\u2019s no small thing to feel stuck in that space. How does this weight affect what you do day to day\u2014like school, your relationships, or just getting through the hours?\nPatient: It\u2019s like there\u2019s this fog that wraps around everything I try to do. When I\u2019m in class, the weight is there, pulling at my focus until everything feels fragmented\u2014words from the teacher wash over me, but my mind drifts back to those questions I can\u2019t answer. It makes it hard to keep up or find motivation, like I\u2019m going through motions without the energy to really engage. School doesn\u2019t feel like a place of growth or discovery anymore; it\u2019s just obstacles to get past.\n\nAnd with people... it\u2019s complicated. I want to connect, especially with my partner, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s this invisible barrier between us\u2014like I\u2019m looking out from behind glass. The restlessness and weariness mix with this numbness that creeps in, almost as if my mind shields me from the intensity by tuning everything out. I get detached because the weight is so raw; feeling numb feels safer, even though it\u2019s lonely. \n\nThe hardest part is how long this goes on. The hours bleed into each other, heavy and slow, like a constant echo of those hard thoughts bouncing in my head. It\u2019s exhausting just to exist through it all\u2014there\u2019s no real escape, no break. It\u2019s not just being sad; it\u2019s this deep, relentless pressing that makes even the simplest tasks feel like climbing uphill. Moving through the day is its own kind of battle.\nDoctor: You mentioned feeling worn down just getting through the day\u2014how have your energy levels been lately? Also, how\u2019s your ability to focus or make decisions when all that fog settles in?\nPatient: It\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s not the kind of tired that comes from pushing your body too hard. It\u2019s more like this invisible weight pressing down on my whole being, draining my energy in a way that feels crushing rather than just fatigue. Like carrying a heavy load that nobody else can see but that\u2019s always there, sapping what little strength I have left.\n\nMy mind feels clouded most days. Focusing is a constant struggle because thoughts break apart and scatter before I can hold onto them. It\u2019s like trying to grasp smoke\u2014there\u2019s no solid ground, no clear path, just fragments floating and dissolving. Making decisions, even the smallest ones, becomes this huge challenge, as if my brain is stuck in this thick fog that refuses to lift. I get overwhelmed by the effort it takes just to think clearly.\n\nAll of this\u2014this relentless questioning of what it means to live, to exist\u2014it settles into my bones, adding another layer of weight that I can\u2019t escape. It drains my energy and clogs my mind, making every moment feel like trudging uphill through a storm I can\u2019t outrun. It\u2019s exhausting in a way that feels permanent, like a shadow that dims everything, and that\u2019s the hardest part\u2014knowing it\u2019s there no matter what I do.\nDoctor: Sounds like you\u2019re carrying this huge, unseen weight that\u2019s always there\u2014sapping your energy and messing with your focus. That kind of constant fog and exhaustion must make everything feel relentless. If you want to talk more about how this all lands day-to-day, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s like this thick, invisible fog seeps into every part of my day\u2014it blurs the edges of even the simplest tasks until they lose their shape and meaning. Getting up, moving through school, talking with others\u2014even those things that used to feel real and present now feel distant and filtered, as if I\u2019m watching life through a cracked lens that warps everything. The exhaustion isn\u2019t just in my body; it\u2019s in my perception, like reality itself is slipping away bit by bit.\n\nThat feeling of detachment\u2014like I\u2019m separate from the world and the people around me\u2014is one of the hardest parts. It\u2019s a kind of numbness that protects me from the sharpness of my own thoughts but also isolates me in a way that cuts deep. I want to reach out, to feel connected, but there\u2019s this barrier that keeps me tethered to the dark spiral inside. The more I wrestle with these heavy questions about why any of this matters, the heavier everything feels, and the further I drift from feeling grounded or hopeful.\n\nThis cycle of exhaustion, fog, and isolation traps me in a place where meaning fractures and the future seems like a distant, unknowable shadow. It\u2019s not just tiredness or sadness; it\u2019s a relentless internal battle over existence itself, and some days that fight feels like all I have left.\nDoctor: What you\u2019re describing\u2014the numbness, feeling distant from everything, and caught in that relentless fog\u2014sounds incredibly tough. It makes sense you\u2019d feel overwhelmed when grappling with such deep, heavy questions about life and meaning every day. It\u2019s okay to feel like this; you\u2019re not alone in facing it.\nPatient: It\u2019s crushing to admit, but that numbness and fog almost feel like both a shield and a prison. They dull the sharpness of the questions swirling in my mind, but they also trap me deeper in that dark space where meaning slips away. It\u2019s like every time I try to reach for something real, the fog pulls me back into this isolating place where hope feels distant\u2014almost erased.\n\nThat distance from others isn\u2019t just loneliness; it feels like an invisible wall that separates me from any sense of belonging or warmth. It amplifies the struggle, makes the questions even more urgent and painful because there\u2019s nowhere safe to lay them down. So yeah, the numbness and fog don\u2019t just block my senses\u2014they smother my very sense of self and possibility.\nDoctor: You mentioned those recurring thoughts about death earlier. Can you tell me more about what those thoughts look like? Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or ways you might do that?\nPatient: The thoughts about death creep in like shadows on the edges of my mind\u2014quiet but persistent, like a slow tide pulling at the shore of my thoughts. They\u2019re less about wanting to end things in a clear-cut way and more about trying to understand what death really means, why it\u2019s the final chapter no one fully knows. It feels like staring down into a dark abyss, searching for something solid to hold onto, but finding only questions and silence.\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014sometimes those thoughts do get heavy enough that I wonder if stepping away from all this pain might bring some relief, a kind of escape from the suffocating weight inside. But there\u2019s no plan, no steps laid out. It\u2019s more like a shadow that settles beside me in the quiet moments, a thought that whispers but doesn\u2019t scream. It makes me feel isolated because these thoughts aren\u2019t easy to share or explain, and they set me apart from the world in a way that deepens the loneliness.\n\nIt\u2019s this constant tension\u2014holding on while wrestling with what it all means and wondering if the struggle itself has any purpose. That uncertainty crushes me more than anything\u2014feeling this heavy burden with no clear path forward, no simple answer to the pain that lingers beneath it all.\nDoctor: It takes real courage to speak so openly about those heavy thoughts and the loneliness they bring. You\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you. You\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here to help you find some clarity and relief in that burden, even if the answers feel out of reach right now.\nPatient: Thank you. It\u2019s not easy to put all this into words, but having someone listen without judgment means more than I can say. This burden\u2026 it\u2019s like carrying a stone that never gets lighter, no matter how much I want it to be. The weight presses down constantly, especially those questions about existence and what it all really means. They don\u2019t come with answers\u2014just more questions\u2014and that\u2019s exhausting in itself.\n\nI\u2019m wary but open to any help or guidance that might ease this load, even if it doesn\u2019t solve everything right away. The struggle feels ongoing, like a search without a clear destination, but maybe having support can make the path a little less dark and lonely. I want to try, even if the answers remain elusive, because somewhere beneath it all I know this isn\u2019t how things have to stay.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how hard it is to focus and make decisions with all that fog clouding your mind. Can you tell me more about how often you find it tough to concentrate or decide even simple things during your day? Understanding this better will help us figure out the best way to support you.\nPatient: It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it really throws me off. There are moments during the day when my thoughts just scatter, and focusing on what\u2019s in front of me feels impossible\u2014like my mind is slipping through cracks I can\u2019t patch. Even deciding something small, like what to do next or how to respond, feels like climbing a steep mountain with no clear path.\n\nThese moments aren\u2019t constant, but they hit hard when they come, breaking the flow of my day and adding to the weight I already carry. It feels tied to that bigger existential fog I\u2019m trapped in\u2014like the heaviness presses in on my ability to think straight and be present. Those times remind me how much this isn\u2019t just about being tired or distracted; it\u2019s a deep fog that clouds everything, making even the simplest things feel overwhelming.\nDoctor: Those moments when your mind just won\u2019t settle must be so frustrating, especially when they disrupt your day like that. It\u2019s totally understandable that the fog would make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. If you want to talk more about how this affects you or ways you\u2019ve managed so far, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: It really is frustrating\u2014those moments when nothing sticks, and every choice feels like too much to handle. It\u2019s like my mind closes off, and all I can do is try to push through or distract myself just to keep moving forward. Sometimes I avoid things altogether because making a decision or focusing feels impossible, and that just adds to the cycle.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019m trying\u2014not always successfully, but I keep trying to hold onto whatever small things I can manage. It\u2019s a slow, uneven process, and some days are harder than others, but I guess that\u2019s part of living with this fog. I keep hoping for some clarity or relief, even if it feels far away right now.\nDoctor: It\u2019s no small thing to keep pushing forward when your mind won\u2019t cooperate, and that slow, uneven progress still matters a great deal. What you\u2019re doing\u2014holding on and trying\u2014is a real effort, especially in the middle of such a fog. That hope for clarity and relief? It\u2019s worth holding onto, and I\u2019m here to help you find ways through it.\nPatient: Thank you\u2014I appreciate that. It\u2019s hard to keep going when everything feels so clouded, but I do want to believe there\u2019s something beyond this fog, even if it\u2019s faint right now. The struggle isn\u2019t just about managing symptoms; it feels like part of a deeper search for meaning, even if the path is confusing and heavy. \n\nI\u2019m cautiously hopeful that with support, I can find moments of clarity and a bit of relief from the weight that presses so hard. It\u2019s a slow journey, and some days feel darker than others, but having someone beside me while I navigate this makes a difference. It\u2019s a small light, but it\u2019s enough to keep me holding on for now.\nDoctor: You\u2019ve mentioned how tough and slow this journey feels, but also that hope you\u2019re holding onto. Can I ask if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your weight or appetite lately\u2014either eating more, less, or shifts in how you feel about food? It helps to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\nPatient: Actually, I haven\u2019t noticed any real changes in my weight or appetite. Food feels pretty steady\u2014neither more nor less appealing than usual. It\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t shifted much, which feels like a small anchor in the middle of everything else that seems so uncertain and heavy. Even with all the fog and weight in my mind, this part feels stable, if only barely.\nDoctor: It\u2019s good to hear that your appetite and weight have stayed steady\u2014that kind of stability can be important when so much else feels uncertain. How about your sleep\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well you\u2019re sleeping, or trouble falling or staying asleep?\nPatient: My sleep hasn\u2019t changed much either. It\u2019s steady, like my appetite, which is a small but meaningful constant in the middle of all the mental fog and weight I carry. I don\u2019t have trouble falling or staying asleep, and those nights of rest feel like rare moments where everything isn\u2019t quite so heavy. It\u2019s not a fix, by any means, but it feels like a grounding point when so much else feels unsettled.\nDoctor: That steady sleep and appetite sound like important anchors for you right now. With that in mind, how often have you been feeling overwhelmingly sad or down lately\u2014like the deep lows you've described\u2014throughout your days or weeks?\nPatient: I\u2019ve been feeling that deep sadness pretty often\u2014more days than not, really. It\u2019s like an invisible weight that sits heavily on my chest and mind, coloring almost everything I do and think. This sadness isn\u2019t just about feeling down; it\u2019s intricately tied to the questions that haunt me\u2014the search for meaning, the fragility of life, and the unsettling sense that clarity always slips just out of reach. \n\nIt\u2019s persistent, almost like a background hum that swells into overwhelming waves at times, dragging me into a space that\u2019s hard to escape. That feeling makes even the simplest moments feel loaded, as if everything is suffused with this quiet, intense sorrow tied to the existential struggle I carry every day.\nDoctor: That steady, heavy sadness you\u2019re carrying alongside those deep questions sounds exhausting\u2014and like it colors everything in your life right now. It\u2019s a tough place to be, feeling that sorrow so persistently. I hear how much you\u2019re struggling, and that you\u2019re not alone in it.\nPatient: It really is exhausting, carrying that kind of sadness day after day. It\u2019s like a weight that settles deep inside, making even the simplest things feel like too much. That sorrow doesn\u2019t just stay separate\u2014it seeps into everything, fueling the questions I wrestle with about why I\u2019m here and what any of it means. \n\nEven though it feels heavy and relentless, I keep carrying it, because there\u2019s no other choice. It\u2019s part of the battle I\u2019m fighting every day\u2014trying to hold onto something, even when the pain clouds everything else. It\u2019s a struggle that feels endless, but it\u2019s the reality I live with.\nDoctor: That kind of persistent, sinking sadness\u2014it really wears you down, no doubt about it. And yet here you are, still carrying that weight, still fighting to hold on. That takes a lot of strength, even when it doesn\u2019t feel like it. I want you to know I\u2019m here to support you through it.\nPatient: I appreciate that\u2014it means a lot to know I\u2019m not facing this alone. The sadness can feel like sinking into a deep current that pulls at me every day, but somehow I\u2019m still afloat, still holding onto the weight even when it\u2019s almost too much. It\u2019s not easy, and the struggle feels ongoing, but that\u2019s what keeps me searching\u2014trying to find some meaning in all this, even when the answers refuse to come.\n\nHaving someone beside me, someone who understands the depth of this, makes the journey feel less isolating. It doesn\u2019t make the weight disappear, but it softens the edges just enough that I can breathe a little easier. That cautious hope, fragile as it is, is enough to keep me trying, keep me moving through the fog and the questions.\nDoctor: It really is brave to keep going under such pressure, and that fragile hope you\u2019re holding onto is a powerful thing. Having someone here to walk with you can make all the difference, even if the weight hasn\u2019t lifted yet. What helps you hold onto that hope when the fog feels thickest?\nPatient: What helps most, I think, is the idea that I don\u2019t have to have all the answers right now\u2014that it\u2019s okay to keep searching, even when the path feels tangled and unclear. Hope feels fragile, like a flicker of light that can almost be snuffed out by the fog, but it\u2019s enough to keep me from sinking completely. \n\nKnowing there\u2019s someone who understands, who\u2019s willing to walk alongside me in this struggle, gives that flicker a little more strength. It softens the weight just enough that I can find moments of clarity\u2014brief flashes where things feel a little less heavy and a little more real. \n\nHolding onto those small lights, even when they\u2019re faint, keeps me going. It\u2019s not a clear or simple journey, but it\u2019s one I\u2019m willing to keep taking, step by careful step.\nDoctor: That flicker of hope you describe\u2014it\u2019s fragile but real, and it\u2019s clear how much strength it takes to keep reaching for that light despite the fog and uncertainty. Your willingness to keep moving forward, step by step, even when the way isn\u2019t clear, shows a deep resilience. I\u2019m here to walk this path with you, and we\u2019ll figure out how to carry that light together.\nPatient: Thank you. Having someone who understands and is willing to walk alongside me\u2014it means more than words can say. The fog and those endless questions about why I\u2019m here don\u2019t lighten, but that companionship makes the weight feel a bit less crushing. It\u2019s like finding a small clearing in a dense forest, a place where I can catch my breath before continuing the search.\n\nHope isn\u2019t some steady flame; it\u2019s more like a fragile, flickering light that I have to protect carefully. But even that faint glow fuels something inside me\u2014a resilience I didn\u2019t know I had, or thought I lost. The struggle is intense and ongoing, but having that light to reach for, even in the darkest moments, keeps me moving forward. It\u2019s meaningful, even if the path remains uncertain.\nDoctor: That flickering light of hope you\u2019ve found\u2014it\u2019s a testament to the strength you carry, even when things feel overwhelming. I want to ask now about how you\u2019ve been feeling about yourself lately\u2014any moments where you\u2019ve felt worthless or overwhelmed by guilt, even when you know you shouldn\u2019t be? Understanding this helps to get a fuller picture of what you\u2019re going through.\nPatient: Honestly, feelings of worthlessness or guilt don\u2019t really fit what I\u2019m experiencing. It\u2019s not that I blame myself or feel like I\u2019m not enough in that way. The heaviness I carry comes from this dense, intangible fog\u2014the weight of those big, unanswered questions about existence and meaning. \n\nIt\u2019s less about self-judgment and more about wrestling with this persistent uncertainty and the emotional burden that comes with it. The struggle doesn\u2019t center on feeling bad about who I am; it\u2019s more about trying to find some clarity in a world that often feels unclear and overwhelming.\nDoctor: I hear that your struggle is more about those heavy, unanswered questions and the uncertainty they bring, rather than feelings of blame or worthlessness. Shifting gears a bit\u2014have you noticed losing interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy, beyond that fog you\u2019ve described?\nPatient: There are times when things I usually enjoy just... lose some of their spark. It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but enough that it\u2019s noticeable and adds another layer to the heaviness I feel. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve completely given up on those things, but the pleasure I get from them feels dulled or distant, like I\u2019m watching from afar rather than really being there.\n\nI guess it ties back into the bigger picture\u2014those lingering questions make it hard to fully engage or find meaning in anything, even the things that used to matter. So, while I still hold onto hope and the desire to connect with those moments, they sometimes feel just out of reach.\nDoctor: That fading of enjoyment, even if it\u2019s not constant, sounds really tough\u2014like watching life through a window instead of stepping inside. How often do you notice this dulled pleasure, and how does it affect your day-to-day or your connections with others? Has this changed much over time, or does it feel pretty steady?\nPatient: It happens fairly often, but not constantly. There\u2019s this quiet distance that settles\u2014the feeling that I\u2019m observing more than fully participating. It affects how I relate to people and even to myself, like there\u2019s a layer between me and what\u2019s happening around me. But it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve completely shut down or lost all connection.\n\nI\u2019d say it feels pretty steady, more of a background presence than something that flares up or shifts dramatically. It\u2019s a subtle but persistent weight that colors my experience without overwhelming it completely. That distance makes things harder, but it hasn\u2019t changed drastically over time\u2014more like a steady undercurrent that I\u2019m still trying to navigate.\nDoctor: That steady distance you describe, like a quiet undercurrent\u2014it sounds really hard to carry day after day. Now, thinking about your body and energy, have you noticed any changes there? Like feeling slower than usual, restless, or maybe having trouble sitting still?\nPatient: Sometimes I do notice this restlessness, like a low hum beneath everything else, but it\u2019s not overwhelming\u2014more like a subtle tension that doesn\u2019t quite let me settle. At other times, I feel slowed down, like moving through everything in slow motion or with extra effort. \n\nThese shifts aren\u2019t extreme or constant, but they come and go as part of the overall fog and weight that\u2019s always there. It\u2019s like my body and mind are both caught in this strange rhythm tied to the heaviness I carry, and it just ebbs and flows with no clear pattern.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
