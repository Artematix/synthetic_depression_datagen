Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

It\u2019s aggravating to feel this dragged down and restless at the same time\u2014it\u2019s a lousy combination for getting anything done or feeling even halfway decent.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue and restlessness sounds really tough and draining, especially when it\u2019s interfering with your routines and projects. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight since these symptoms started? It\u2019s important to get a full picture for how your depression might be affecting you.\nPatient: No, there haven\u2019t been any changes in my appetite or weight.

Sleep\u2019s a nightmare; it\u2019s been dragging on just as long, restless nights that leave me wired and frustrated. The psychomotor agitation shows up now and then, not too often, but enough to be noticeable. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at, straightforward enough.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straightforward about this, Martin. Can you tell me more about how the restless sleep and that agitation are impacting your day-to-day life and your energy overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s a constant grind\u2014when I don\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m running on empty all day, and that tiredness just turns into raw irritability. I snap at small things and find it nearly impossible to focus on anything meaningful. The restlessness hits in waves; I can\u2019t sit still, which drives me nuts because it\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t shut off, and I\u2019m stuck pacing or shifting around without relief. It screws with any routine or personal projects I try to do, and honestly, it piles on more stress instead of easing anything. It\u2019s aggravating to feel this dragged down and restless at the same time\u2014it\u2019s a lousy combination for getting anything done or feeling even halfway decent.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue and restlessness sounds really tough and draining, especially when it\u2019s interfering with your routines and projects. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight since these symptoms started? It\u2019s important to get a full picture for how your depression might be affecting you.\nPatient: No, there haven\u2019t been any changes in my appetite or weight.

It\u2019s important to hear how you\u2019re thinking about yourself during this time.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve felt worthless at times. It\u2019s frustrating because I know it\u2019s not productive, but it\u2019s there\u2014like this nagging voice that reminds me I\u2019m not what I used to be. It doesn\u2019t spiral into guilt or anything dramatic, just this tired sense that I\u2019m falling short or not measuring up. I don\u2019t dwell on it too much, but it\u2019s definitely part of the background noise.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that nagging sense of not measuring up is for you. How often does this feeling of worthlessness show up, and when it does, how strongly does it affect your motivation or even how you take care of yourself day to day?\nPatient: It pops up now and then, not all the time\u2014but enough to be annoying. It\u2019s more like this low hum in the background than a full-blown takeover. When it hits, motivation definitely takes a hit, but I still manage to keep up with the basics. I\u2019m not falling apart or anything, just frustrated that it drags me down more than it should.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that\u2014sounds like it's a steady drain, even if not overwhelming. How about your interest or pleasure in things you usually enjoy? Are you still finding some satisfaction in your usual activities, like your volunteer work at the library?\nPatient: Yeah, I still get some satisfaction from the volunteer work at the library, but it\u2019s nowhere near what it used to be. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to stay engaged, but the motivation wavers a lot. I have to push myself more than I\u2019d like just to keep up with it.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Look, the mood\u2019s been a constant dark cloud most days\u2014six to ten days recently, if I\u2019m honest. Sleep\u2019s a nightmare; it\u2019s been dragging on just as long, restless nights that leave me wired and frustrated. The psychomotor agitation shows up now and then, not too often, but enough to be noticeable. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at, straightforward enough.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straightforward about this, Martin. Can you tell me more about how the restless sleep and that agitation are impacting your day-to-day life and your energy overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s a constant grind\u2014when I don\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m running on empty all day, and that tiredness just turns into raw irritability. I snap at small things and find it nearly impossible to focus on anything meaningful. The restlessness hits in waves; I can\u2019t sit still, which drives me nuts because it\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t shut off, and I\u2019m stuck pacing or shifting around without relief. It screws with any routine or personal projects I try to do, and honestly, it piles on more stress instead of easing anything. It\u2019s aggravating to feel this dragged down and restless at the same time\u2014it\u2019s a lousy combination for getting anything done or feeling even halfway decent.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue and restlessness sounds really tough and draining, especially when it\u2019s interfering with your routines and projects. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight since these symptoms started? It\u2019s important to get a full picture for how your depression might be affecting you.\nPatient: No, there haven\u2019t been any changes in my appetite or weight. That part\u2019s stayed steady.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014appetite and weight are steady. Now, have you been feeling a lot of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s important to hear how you\u2019re thinking about yourself during this time.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve felt worthless at times. It\u2019s frustrating because I know it\u2019s not productive, but it\u2019s there\u2014like this nagging voice that reminds me I\u2019m not what I used to be. It doesn\u2019t spiral into guilt or anything dramatic, just this tired sense that I\u2019m falling short or not measuring up. I don\u2019t dwell on it too much, but it\u2019s definitely part of the background noise.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that nagging sense of not measuring up is for you. How often does this feeling of worthlessness show up, and when it does, how strongly does it affect your motivation or even how you take care of yourself day to day?\nPatient: It pops up now and then, not all the time\u2014but enough to be annoying. It\u2019s more like this low hum in the background than a full-blown takeover. When it hits, motivation definitely takes a hit, but I still manage to keep up with the basics. I\u2019m not falling apart or anything, just frustrated that it drags me down more than it should.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that\u2014sounds like it's a steady drain, even if not overwhelming. How about your interest or pleasure in things you usually enjoy? Are you still finding some satisfaction in your usual activities, like your volunteer work at the library?\nPatient: Yeah, I still get some satisfaction from the volunteer work at the library, but it\u2019s nowhere near what it used to be. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to stay engaged, but the motivation wavers a lot. I have to push myself more than I\u2019d like just to keep up with it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve given up completely, but it\u2019s definitely been a struggle.\nDoctor: It sounds like your connection to the volunteering has taken a hit, even if you\u2019re still holding on to it. How has that drop in pleasure and drive changed over time, and what kind of impact is it having on your day-to-day mood and functioning?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a gradual decline\u2014little by little, the pleasure I used to get from volunteering has faded, and the drive to stay involved comes and goes. Some days I\u2019m able to push through, but other times it feels like a real effort just to show up.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Look, the mood\u2019s been a constant dark cloud most days\u2014six to ten days recently, if I\u2019m honest. Sleep\u2019s a nightmare; it\u2019s been dragging on just as long, restless nights that leave me wired and frustrated. The psychomotor agitation shows up now and then, not too often, but enough to be noticeable. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at, straightforward enough.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straightforward about this, Martin. Can you tell me more about how the restless sleep and that agitation are impacting your day-to-day life and your energy overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s a constant grind\u2014when I don\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m running on empty all day, and that tiredness just turns into raw irritability. I snap at small things and find it nearly impossible to focus on anything meaningful. The restlessness hits in waves; I can\u2019t sit still, which drives me nuts because it\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t shut off, and I\u2019m stuck pacing or shifting around without relief. It screws with any routine or personal projects I try to do, and honestly, it piles on more stress instead of easing anything. It\u2019s aggravating to feel this dragged down and restless at the same time\u2014it\u2019s a lousy combination for getting anything done or feeling even halfway decent.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue and restlessness sounds really tough and draining, especially when it\u2019s interfering with your routines and projects. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight since these symptoms started? It\u2019s important to get a full picture for how your depression might be affecting you.\nPatient: No, there haven\u2019t been any changes in my appetite or weight. That part\u2019s stayed steady.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014appetite and weight are steady. Now, have you been feeling a lot of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s important to hear how you\u2019re thinking about yourself during this time.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve felt worthless at times. It\u2019s frustrating because I know it\u2019s not productive, but it\u2019s there\u2014like this nagging voice that reminds me I\u2019m not what I used to be. It doesn\u2019t spiral into guilt or anything dramatic, just this tired sense that I\u2019m falling short or not measuring up. I don\u2019t dwell on it too much, but it\u2019s definitely part of the background noise.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that nagging sense of not measuring up is for you. How often does this feeling of worthlessness show up, and when it does, how strongly does it affect your motivation or even how you take care of yourself day to day?\nPatient: It pops up now and then, not all the time\u2014but enough to be annoying. It\u2019s more like this low hum in the background than a full-blown takeover. When it hits, motivation definitely takes a hit, but I still manage to keep up with the basics. I\u2019m not falling apart or anything, just frustrated that it drags me down more than it should.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that\u2014sounds like it's a steady drain, even if not overwhelming. How about your interest or pleasure in things you usually enjoy? Are you still finding some satisfaction in your usual activities, like your volunteer work at the library?\nPatient: Yeah, I still get some satisfaction from the volunteer work at the library, but it\u2019s nowhere near what it used to be. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to stay engaged, but the motivation wavers a lot. I have to push myself more than I\u2019d like just to keep up with it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve given up completely, but it\u2019s definitely been a struggle.\nDoctor: It sounds like your connection to the volunteering has taken a hit, even if you\u2019re still holding on to it. How has that drop in pleasure and drive changed over time, and what kind of impact is it having on your day-to-day mood and functioning?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a gradual decline\u2014little by little, the pleasure I used to get from volunteering has faded, and the drive to stay involved comes and goes. Some days I\u2019m able to push through, but other times it feels like a real effort just to show up. It\u2019s not always obvious on the surface, but that constant background frustration wears on me. It\u2019s this subtle weight dragging down my mood and making day-to-day functioning more of a chore than it should be.\nDoctor: That subtle but constant weight you describe can be really hard to carry day in and day out. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to talk about, and I want you to know you\u2019re in a safe space here.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts about death or suicide recently.

Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Look, the mood\u2019s been a constant dark cloud most days\u2014six to ten days recently, if I\u2019m honest. Sleep\u2019s a nightmare; it\u2019s been dragging on just as long, restless nights that leave me wired and frustrated. The psychomotor agitation shows up now and then, not too often, but enough to be noticeable. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at, straightforward enough.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straightforward about this, Martin. Can you tell me more about how the restless sleep and that agitation are impacting your day-to-day life and your energy overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s a constant grind\u2014when I don\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m running on empty all day, and that tiredness just turns into raw irritability. I snap at small things and find it nearly impossible to focus on anything meaningful. The restlessness hits in waves; I can\u2019t sit still, which drives me nuts because it\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t shut off, and I\u2019m stuck pacing or shifting around without relief. It screws with any routine or personal projects I try to do, and honestly, it piles on more stress instead of easing anything. It\u2019s aggravating to feel this dragged down and restless at the same time\u2014it\u2019s a lousy combination for getting anything done or feeling even halfway decent.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue and restlessness sounds really tough and draining, especially when it\u2019s interfering with your routines and projects. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight since these symptoms started? It\u2019s important to get a full picture for how your depression might be affecting you.\nPatient: No, there haven\u2019t been any changes in my appetite or weight. That part\u2019s stayed steady.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014appetite and weight are steady. Now, have you been feeling a lot of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s important to hear how you\u2019re thinking about yourself during this time.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve felt worthless at times. It\u2019s frustrating because I know it\u2019s not productive, but it\u2019s there\u2014like this nagging voice that reminds me I\u2019m not what I used to be. It doesn\u2019t spiral into guilt or anything dramatic, just this tired sense that I\u2019m falling short or not measuring up. I don\u2019t dwell on it too much, but it\u2019s definitely part of the background noise.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that nagging sense of not measuring up is for you. How often does this feeling of worthlessness show up, and when it does, how strongly does it affect your motivation or even how you take care of yourself day to day?\nPatient: It pops up now and then, not all the time\u2014but enough to be annoying. It\u2019s more like this low hum in the background than a full-blown takeover. When it hits, motivation definitely takes a hit, but I still manage to keep up with the basics. I\u2019m not falling apart or anything, just frustrated that it drags me down more than it should.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that\u2014sounds like it's a steady drain, even if not overwhelming. How about your interest or pleasure in things you usually enjoy? Are you still finding some satisfaction in your usual activities, like your volunteer work at the library?\nPatient: Yeah, I still get some satisfaction from the volunteer work at the library, but it\u2019s nowhere near what it used to be. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to stay engaged, but the motivation wavers a lot. I have to push myself more than I\u2019d like just to keep up with it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve given up completely, but it\u2019s definitely been a struggle.\nDoctor: It sounds like your connection to the volunteering has taken a hit, even if you\u2019re still holding on to it. How has that drop in pleasure and drive changed over time, and what kind of impact is it having on your day-to-day mood and functioning?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a gradual decline\u2014little by little, the pleasure I used to get from volunteering has faded, and the drive to stay involved comes and goes. Some days I\u2019m able to push through, but other times it feels like a real effort just to show up. It\u2019s not always obvious on the surface, but that constant background frustration wears on me. It\u2019s this subtle weight dragging down my mood and making day-to-day functioning more of a chore than it should be.\nDoctor: That subtle but constant weight you describe can be really hard to carry day in and day out. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to talk about, and I want you to know you\u2019re in a safe space here.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts about death or suicide recently. Just so we\u2019re clear.\nDoctor: Thanks for being clear on that. Have you noticed any trouble concentrating or making decisions lately? Understanding this helps get a full picture of how things might be affecting your daily life.\nPatient: Yeah, trouble concentrating and making decisions comes up fairly often. It\u2019s enough to slow me down and makes it harder to get anything done without feeling annoyed at myself. It\u2019s not a crash-and-burn situation, but it definitely adds to the daily frustration and makes things more difficult than they should be.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nYeah, trouble concentrating and making decisions comes up fairly often.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

Sleep\u2019s a nightmare; it\u2019s been dragging on just as long, restless nights that leave me wired and frustrated. The psychomotor agitation shows up now and then, not too often, but enough to be noticeable. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at, straightforward enough.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straightforward about this, Martin. Can you tell me more about how the restless sleep and that agitation are impacting your day-to-day life and your energy overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s a constant grind\u2014when I don\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m running on empty all day, and that tiredness just turns into raw irritability. I snap at small things and find it nearly impossible to focus on anything meaningful. The restlessness hits in waves; I can\u2019t sit still, which drives me nuts because it\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t shut off, and I\u2019m stuck pacing or shifting around without relief. It screws with any routine or personal projects I try to do, and honestly, it piles on more stress instead of easing anything. It\u2019s aggravating to feel this dragged down and restless at the same time\u2014it\u2019s a lousy combination for getting anything done or feeling even halfway decent.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue and restlessness sounds really tough and draining, especially when it\u2019s interfering with your routines and projects. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight since these symptoms started? It\u2019s important to get a full picture for how your depression might be affecting you.\nPatient: No, there haven\u2019t been any changes in my appetite or weight. That part\u2019s stayed steady.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014appetite and weight are steady. Now, have you been feeling a lot of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s important to hear how you\u2019re thinking about yourself during this time.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve felt worthless at times. It\u2019s frustrating because I know it\u2019s not productive, but it\u2019s there\u2014like this nagging voice that reminds me I\u2019m not what I used to be. It doesn\u2019t spiral into guilt or anything dramatic, just this tired sense that I\u2019m falling short or not measuring up. I don\u2019t dwell on it too much, but it\u2019s definitely part of the background noise.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that nagging sense of not measuring up is for you. How often does this feeling of worthlessness show up, and when it does, how strongly does it affect your motivation or even how you take care of yourself day to day?\nPatient: It pops up now and then, not all the time\u2014but enough to be annoying. It\u2019s more like this low hum in the background than a full-blown takeover. When it hits, motivation definitely takes a hit, but I still manage to keep up with the basics. I\u2019m not falling apart or anything, just frustrated that it drags me down more than it should.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that\u2014sounds like it's a steady drain, even if not overwhelming. How about your interest or pleasure in things you usually enjoy? Are you still finding some satisfaction in your usual activities, like your volunteer work at the library?\nPatient: Yeah, I still get some satisfaction from the volunteer work at the library, but it\u2019s nowhere near what it used to be. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to stay engaged, but the motivation wavers a lot. I have to push myself more than I\u2019d like just to keep up with it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve given up completely, but it\u2019s definitely been a struggle.\nDoctor: It sounds like your connection to the volunteering has taken a hit, even if you\u2019re still holding on to it. How has that drop in pleasure and drive changed over time, and what kind of impact is it having on your day-to-day mood and functioning?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a gradual decline\u2014little by little, the pleasure I used to get from volunteering has faded, and the drive to stay involved comes and goes. Some days I\u2019m able to push through, but other times it feels like a real effort just to show up. It\u2019s not always obvious on the surface, but that constant background frustration wears on me. It\u2019s this subtle weight dragging down my mood and making day-to-day functioning more of a chore than it should be.\nDoctor: That subtle but constant weight you describe can be really hard to carry day in and day out. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to talk about, and I want you to know you\u2019re in a safe space here.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts about death or suicide recently. Just so we\u2019re clear.\nDoctor: Thanks for being clear on that. Have you noticed any trouble concentrating or making decisions lately? Understanding this helps get a full picture of how things might be affecting your daily life.\nPatient: Yeah, trouble concentrating and making decisions comes up fairly often. It\u2019s enough to slow me down and makes it harder to get anything done without feeling annoyed at myself. It\u2019s not a crash-and-burn situation, but it definitely adds to the daily frustration and makes things more difficult than they should be.\nDoctor: Understood\u2014it sounds like these cognitive issues, while not overwhelming, still weigh on you and complicate daily tasks. How severe would you say these problems with focus and making choices are on most days?\nPatient: They\u2019re definitely a significant nuisance on most days\u2014enough to slow me down and wear on my patience\u2014but not so severe that I can\u2019t manage.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Look, the mood\u2019s been a constant dark cloud most days\u2014six to ten days recently, if I\u2019m honest. Sleep\u2019s a nightmare; it\u2019s been dragging on just as long, restless nights that leave me wired and frustrated. The psychomotor agitation shows up now and then, not too often, but enough to be noticeable. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at, straightforward enough.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straightforward about this, Martin. Can you tell me more about how the restless sleep and that agitation are impacting your day-to-day life and your energy overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s a constant grind\u2014when I don\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m running on empty all day, and that tiredness just turns into raw irritability. I snap at small things and find it nearly impossible to focus on anything meaningful. The restlessness hits in waves; I can\u2019t sit still, which drives me nuts because it\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t shut off, and I\u2019m stuck pacing or shifting around without relief. It screws with any routine or personal projects I try to do, and honestly, it piles on more stress instead of easing anything. It\u2019s aggravating to feel this dragged down and restless at the same time\u2014it\u2019s a lousy combination for getting anything done or feeling even halfway decent.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue and restlessness sounds really tough and draining, especially when it\u2019s interfering with your routines and projects. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight since these symptoms started? It\u2019s important to get a full picture for how your depression might be affecting you.\nPatient: No, there haven\u2019t been any changes in my appetite or weight. That part\u2019s stayed steady.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014appetite and weight are steady. Now, have you been feeling a lot of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s important to hear how you\u2019re thinking about yourself during this time.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve felt worthless at times. It\u2019s frustrating because I know it\u2019s not productive, but it\u2019s there\u2014like this nagging voice that reminds me I\u2019m not what I used to be. It doesn\u2019t spiral into guilt or anything dramatic, just this tired sense that I\u2019m falling short or not measuring up. I don\u2019t dwell on it too much, but it\u2019s definitely part of the background noise.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that nagging sense of not measuring up is for you. How often does this feeling of worthlessness show up, and when it does, how strongly does it affect your motivation or even how you take care of yourself day to day?\nPatient: It pops up now and then, not all the time\u2014but enough to be annoying. It\u2019s more like this low hum in the background than a full-blown takeover. When it hits, motivation definitely takes a hit, but I still manage to keep up with the basics. I\u2019m not falling apart or anything, just frustrated that it drags me down more than it should.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that\u2014sounds like it's a steady drain, even if not overwhelming. How about your interest or pleasure in things you usually enjoy? Are you still finding some satisfaction in your usual activities, like your volunteer work at the library?\nPatient: Yeah, I still get some satisfaction from the volunteer work at the library, but it\u2019s nowhere near what it used to be. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to stay engaged, but the motivation wavers a lot. I have to push myself more than I\u2019d like just to keep up with it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve given up completely, but it\u2019s definitely been a struggle.\nDoctor: It sounds like your connection to the volunteering has taken a hit, even if you\u2019re still holding on to it. How has that drop in pleasure and drive changed over time, and what kind of impact is it having on your day-to-day mood and functioning?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a gradual decline\u2014little by little, the pleasure I used to get from volunteering has faded, and the drive to stay involved comes and goes. Some days I\u2019m able to push through, but other times it feels like a real effort just to show up. It\u2019s not always obvious on the surface, but that constant background frustration wears on me. It\u2019s this subtle weight dragging down my mood and making day-to-day functioning more of a chore than it should be.\nDoctor: That subtle but constant weight you describe can be really hard to carry day in and day out. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to talk about, and I want you to know you\u2019re in a safe space here.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts about death or suicide recently. Just so we\u2019re clear.\nDoctor: Thanks for being clear on that. Have you noticed any trouble concentrating or making decisions lately? Understanding this helps get a full picture of how things might be affecting your daily life.\nPatient: Yeah, trouble concentrating and making decisions comes up fairly often. It\u2019s enough to slow me down and makes it harder to get anything done without feeling annoyed at myself. It\u2019s not a crash-and-burn situation, but it definitely adds to the daily frustration and makes things more difficult than they should be.\nDoctor: Understood\u2014it sounds like these cognitive issues, while not overwhelming, still weigh on you and complicate daily tasks. How severe would you say these problems with focus and making choices are on most days?\nPatient: They\u2019re definitely a significant nuisance on most days\u2014enough to slow me down and wear on my patience\u2014but not so severe that I can\u2019t manage. It\u2019s frustrating to have to work harder to get through routine tasks, but it\u2019s something I handle, even if it drains me more than it should.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014these issues slow you down and test your patience but don\u2019t completely stop you. How often do you feel fatigued or low on energy, and how much does that affect your daily functioning?\nPatient: Fatigue hits me pretty often \u2014 enough to seriously drain my energy and endurance throughout the day.

It\u2019s enough to slow me down and makes it harder to get anything done without feeling annoyed at myself. It\u2019s not a crash-and-burn situation, but it definitely adds to the daily frustration and makes things more difficult than they should be.\nDoctor: Understood\u2014it sounds like these cognitive issues, while not overwhelming, still weigh on you and complicate daily tasks. How severe would you say these problems with focus and making choices are on most days?\nPatient: They\u2019re definitely a significant nuisance on most days\u2014enough to slow me down and wear on my patience\u2014but not so severe that I can\u2019t manage. It\u2019s frustrating to have to work harder to get through routine tasks, but it\u2019s something I handle, even if it drains me more than it should.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014these issues slow you down and test your patience but don\u2019t completely stop you. How often do you feel fatigued or low on energy, and how much does that affect your daily functioning?\nPatient: Fatigue hits me pretty often \u2014 enough to seriously drain my energy and endurance throughout the day. It\u2019s a real pain having to push through feeling worn out, and it definitely makes me more irritable than I\u2019d like. Keeping up with daily routines feels tougher, and it all just builds up on itself.\nDoctor: Sounds like that fatigue is a big factor wearing you down. How often during the day does this tiredness hit you, and what do you do to try and manage it along with the irritability?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nSounds like that fatigue is a big factor wearing you down.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Look, the mood\u2019s been a constant dark cloud most days\u2014six to ten days recently, if I\u2019m honest. Sleep\u2019s a nightmare; it\u2019s been dragging on just as long, restless nights that leave me wired and frustrated. The psychomotor agitation shows up now and then, not too often, but enough to be noticeable. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at, straightforward enough.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straightforward about this, Martin. Can you tell me more about how the restless sleep and that agitation are impacting your day-to-day life and your energy overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s a constant grind\u2014when I don\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m running on empty all day, and that tiredness just turns into raw irritability. I snap at small things and find it nearly impossible to focus on anything meaningful. The restlessness hits in waves; I can\u2019t sit still, which drives me nuts because it\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t shut off, and I\u2019m stuck pacing or shifting around without relief. It screws with any routine or personal projects I try to do, and honestly, it piles on more stress instead of easing anything. It\u2019s aggravating to feel this dragged down and restless at the same time\u2014it\u2019s a lousy combination for getting anything done or feeling even halfway decent.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue and restlessness sounds really tough and draining, especially when it\u2019s interfering with your routines and projects. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight since these symptoms started? It\u2019s important to get a full picture for how your depression might be affecting you.\nPatient: No, there haven\u2019t been any changes in my appetite or weight. That part\u2019s stayed steady.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014appetite and weight are steady. Now, have you been feeling a lot of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s important to hear how you\u2019re thinking about yourself during this time.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve felt worthless at times. It\u2019s frustrating because I know it\u2019s not productive, but it\u2019s there\u2014like this nagging voice that reminds me I\u2019m not what I used to be. It doesn\u2019t spiral into guilt or anything dramatic, just this tired sense that I\u2019m falling short or not measuring up. I don\u2019t dwell on it too much, but it\u2019s definitely part of the background noise.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that nagging sense of not measuring up is for you. How often does this feeling of worthlessness show up, and when it does, how strongly does it affect your motivation or even how you take care of yourself day to day?\nPatient: It pops up now and then, not all the time\u2014but enough to be annoying. It\u2019s more like this low hum in the background than a full-blown takeover. When it hits, motivation definitely takes a hit, but I still manage to keep up with the basics. I\u2019m not falling apart or anything, just frustrated that it drags me down more than it should.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that\u2014sounds like it's a steady drain, even if not overwhelming. How about your interest or pleasure in things you usually enjoy? Are you still finding some satisfaction in your usual activities, like your volunteer work at the library?\nPatient: Yeah, I still get some satisfaction from the volunteer work at the library, but it\u2019s nowhere near what it used to be. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to stay engaged, but the motivation wavers a lot. I have to push myself more than I\u2019d like just to keep up with it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve given up completely, but it\u2019s definitely been a struggle.\nDoctor: It sounds like your connection to the volunteering has taken a hit, even if you\u2019re still holding on to it. How has that drop in pleasure and drive changed over time, and what kind of impact is it having on your day-to-day mood and functioning?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a gradual decline\u2014little by little, the pleasure I used to get from volunteering has faded, and the drive to stay involved comes and goes. Some days I\u2019m able to push through, but other times it feels like a real effort just to show up. It\u2019s not always obvious on the surface, but that constant background frustration wears on me. It\u2019s this subtle weight dragging down my mood and making day-to-day functioning more of a chore than it should be.\nDoctor: That subtle but constant weight you describe can be really hard to carry day in and day out. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to talk about, and I want you to know you\u2019re in a safe space here.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts about death or suicide recently. Just so we\u2019re clear.\nDoctor: Thanks for being clear on that. Have you noticed any trouble concentrating or making decisions lately?

Can you tell me more about how the restless sleep and that agitation are impacting your day-to-day life and your energy overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s a constant grind\u2014when I don\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m running on empty all day, and that tiredness just turns into raw irritability. I snap at small things and find it nearly impossible to focus on anything meaningful. The restlessness hits in waves; I can\u2019t sit still, which drives me nuts because it\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t shut off, and I\u2019m stuck pacing or shifting around without relief. It screws with any routine or personal projects I try to do, and honestly, it piles on more stress instead of easing anything. It\u2019s aggravating to feel this dragged down and restless at the same time\u2014it\u2019s a lousy combination for getting anything done or feeling even halfway decent.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue and restlessness sounds really tough and draining, especially when it\u2019s interfering with your routines and projects. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight since these symptoms started? It\u2019s important to get a full picture for how your depression might be affecting you.\nPatient: No, there haven\u2019t been any changes in my appetite or weight. That part\u2019s stayed steady.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014appetite and weight are steady. Now, have you been feeling a lot of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s important to hear how you\u2019re thinking about yourself during this time.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve felt worthless at times. It\u2019s frustrating because I know it\u2019s not productive, but it\u2019s there\u2014like this nagging voice that reminds me I\u2019m not what I used to be. It doesn\u2019t spiral into guilt or anything dramatic, just this tired sense that I\u2019m falling short or not measuring up. I don\u2019t dwell on it too much, but it\u2019s definitely part of the background noise.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that nagging sense of not measuring up is for you. How often does this feeling of worthlessness show up, and when it does, how strongly does it affect your motivation or even how you take care of yourself day to day?\nPatient: It pops up now and then, not all the time\u2014but enough to be annoying. It\u2019s more like this low hum in the background than a full-blown takeover. When it hits, motivation definitely takes a hit, but I still manage to keep up with the basics. I\u2019m not falling apart or anything, just frustrated that it drags me down more than it should.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that\u2014sounds like it's a steady drain, even if not overwhelming. How about your interest or pleasure in things you usually enjoy? Are you still finding some satisfaction in your usual activities, like your volunteer work at the library?\nPatient: Yeah, I still get some satisfaction from the volunteer work at the library, but it\u2019s nowhere near what it used to be. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to stay engaged, but the motivation wavers a lot. I have to push myself more than I\u2019d like just to keep up with it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve given up completely, but it\u2019s definitely been a struggle.\nDoctor: It sounds like your connection to the volunteering has taken a hit, even if you\u2019re still holding on to it. How has that drop in pleasure and drive changed over time, and what kind of impact is it having on your day-to-day mood and functioning?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a gradual decline\u2014little by little, the pleasure I used to get from volunteering has faded, and the drive to stay involved comes and goes. Some days I\u2019m able to push through, but other times it feels like a real effort just to show up. It\u2019s not always obvious on the surface, but that constant background frustration wears on me. It\u2019s this subtle weight dragging down my mood and making day-to-day functioning more of a chore than it should be.\nDoctor: That subtle but constant weight you describe can be really hard to carry day in and day out. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to talk about, and I want you to know you\u2019re in a safe space here.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts about death or suicide recently. Just so we\u2019re clear.\nDoctor: Thanks for being clear on that. Have you noticed any trouble concentrating or making decisions lately? Understanding this helps get a full picture of how things might be affecting your daily life.\nPatient: Yeah, trouble concentrating and making decisions comes up fairly often. It\u2019s enough to slow me down and makes it harder to get anything done without feeling annoyed at myself. It\u2019s not a crash-and-burn situation, but it definitely adds to the daily frustration and makes things more difficult than they should be.\nDoctor: Understood\u2014it sounds like these cognitive issues, while not overwhelming, still weigh on you and complicate daily tasks. How severe would you say these problems with focus and making choices are on most days?\nPatient: They\u2019re definitely a significant nuisance on most days\u2014enough to slow me down and wear on my patience\u2014but not so severe that I can\u2019t manage. It\u2019s frustrating to have to work harder to get through routine tasks, but it\u2019s something I handle, even if it drains me more than it should.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014these issues slow you down and test your patience but don\u2019t completely stop you. How often do you feel fatigued or low on energy, and how much does that affect your daily functioning?\nPatient: Fatigue hits me pretty often \u2014 enough to seriously drain my energy and endurance throughout the day. It\u2019s a real pain having to push through feeling worn out, and it definitely makes me more irritable than I\u2019d like. Keeping up with daily routines feels tougher, and it all just builds up on itself.\nDoctor: Sounds like that fatigue is a big factor wearing you down. How often during the day does this tiredness hit you, and what do you do to try and manage it along with the irritability?\nPatient: The tiredness hits me multiple times a day, draining whatever energy I have left. It feeds right into the irritability, so it\u2019s like a vicious cycle I can\u2019t shake. I try to push through \u2014 taking breaks, pacing myself \u2014 but those strategies only get me so far. At the end of the day, it still makes it harder to keep up with routines, even if I\u2019m managing just barely. It\u2019s frustrating, to say the least.\nDoctor: That ongoing cycle of fatigue and irritability sounds incredibly draining, Martin, especially when it\u2019s making everyday routines so hard to keep up with. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re frustrated. How else do you feel this has been affecting your overall well-being or the ways you cope day to day?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat ongoing cycle of fatigue and irritability sounds incredibly draining, Martin, especially when it\u2019s making everyday routines so hard to keep up with.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Look, the mood\u2019s been a constant dark cloud most days\u2014six to ten days recently, if I\u2019m honest. Sleep\u2019s a nightmare; it\u2019s been dragging on just as long, restless nights that leave me wired and frustrated. The psychomotor agitation shows up now and then, not too often, but enough to be noticeable. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at, straightforward enough.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straightforward about this, Martin. Can you tell me more about how the restless sleep and that agitation are impacting your day-to-day life and your energy overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s a constant grind\u2014when I don\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m running on empty all day, and that tiredness just turns into raw irritability. I snap at small things and find it nearly impossible to focus on anything meaningful. The restlessness hits in waves; I can\u2019t sit still, which drives me nuts because it\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t shut off, and I\u2019m stuck pacing or shifting around without relief. It screws with any routine or personal projects I try to do, and honestly, it piles on more stress instead of easing anything. It\u2019s aggravating to feel this dragged down and restless at the same time\u2014it\u2019s a lousy combination for getting anything done or feeling even halfway decent.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue and restlessness sounds really tough and draining, especially when it\u2019s interfering with your routines and projects. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight since these symptoms started? It\u2019s important to get a full picture for how your depression might be affecting you.\nPatient: No, there haven\u2019t been any changes in my appetite or weight. That part\u2019s stayed steady.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014appetite and weight are steady. Now, have you been feeling a lot of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s important to hear how you\u2019re thinking about yourself during this time.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve felt worthless at times. It\u2019s frustrating because I know it\u2019s not productive, but it\u2019s there\u2014like this nagging voice that reminds me I\u2019m not what I used to be. It doesn\u2019t spiral into guilt or anything dramatic, just this tired sense that I\u2019m falling short or not measuring up. I don\u2019t dwell on it too much, but it\u2019s definitely part of the background noise.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that nagging sense of not measuring up is for you. How often does this feeling of worthlessness show up, and when it does, how strongly does it affect your motivation or even how you take care of yourself day to day?\nPatient: It pops up now and then, not all the time\u2014but enough to be annoying. It\u2019s more like this low hum in the background than a full-blown takeover. When it hits, motivation definitely takes a hit, but I still manage to keep up with the basics. I\u2019m not falling apart or anything, just frustrated that it drags me down more than it should.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that\u2014sounds like it's a steady drain, even if not overwhelming. How about your interest or pleasure in things you usually enjoy? Are you still finding some satisfaction in your usual activities, like your volunteer work at the library?\nPatient: Yeah, I still get some satisfaction from the volunteer work at the library, but it\u2019s nowhere near what it used to be. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to stay engaged, but the motivation wavers a lot. I have to push myself more than I\u2019d like just to keep up with it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve given up completely, but it\u2019s definitely been a struggle.\nDoctor: It sounds like your connection to the volunteering has taken a hit, even if you\u2019re still holding on to it. How has that drop in pleasure and drive changed over time, and what kind of impact is it having on your day-to-day mood and functioning?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a gradual decline\u2014little by little, the pleasure I used to get from volunteering has faded, and the drive to stay involved comes and goes. Some days I\u2019m able to push through, but other times it feels like a real effort just to show up. It\u2019s not always obvious on the surface, but that constant background frustration wears on me. It\u2019s this subtle weight dragging down my mood and making day-to-day functioning more of a chore than it should be.\nDoctor: That subtle but constant weight you describe can be really hard to carry day in and day out. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to talk about, and I want you to know you\u2019re in a safe space here.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts about death or suicide recently. Just so we\u2019re clear.\nDoctor: Thanks for being clear on that. Have you noticed any trouble concentrating or making decisions lately? Understanding this helps get a full picture of how things might be affecting your daily life.\nPatient: Yeah, trouble concentrating and making decisions comes up fairly often. It\u2019s enough to slow me down and makes it harder to get anything done without feeling annoyed at myself. It\u2019s not a crash-and-burn situation, but it definitely adds to the daily frustration and makes things more difficult than they should be.\nDoctor: Understood\u2014it sounds like these cognitive issues, while not overwhelming, still weigh on you and complicate daily tasks. How severe would you say these problems with focus and making choices are on most days?\nPatient: They\u2019re definitely a significant nuisance on most days\u2014enough to slow me down and wear on my patience\u2014but not so severe that I can\u2019t manage. It\u2019s frustrating to have to work harder to get through routine tasks, but it\u2019s something I handle, even if it drains me more than it should.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014these issues slow you down and test your patience but don\u2019t completely stop you. How often do you feel fatigued or low on energy, and how much does that affect your daily functioning?\nPatient: Fatigue hits me pretty often \u2014 enough to seriously drain my energy and endurance throughout the day. It\u2019s a real pain having to push through feeling worn out, and it definitely makes me more irritable than I\u2019d like. Keeping up with daily routines feels tougher, and it all just builds up on itself.\nDoctor: Sounds like that fatigue is a big factor wearing you down. How often during the day does this tiredness hit you, and what do you do to try and manage it along with the irritability?\nPatient: The tiredness hits me multiple times a day, draining whatever energy I have left. It feeds right into the irritability, so it\u2019s like a vicious cycle I can\u2019t shake. I try to push through \u2014 taking breaks, pacing myself \u2014 but those strategies only get me so far. At the end of the day, it still makes it harder to keep up with routines, even if I\u2019m managing just barely. It\u2019s frustrating, to say the least.\nDoctor: That ongoing cycle of fatigue and irritability sounds incredibly draining, Martin, especially when it\u2019s making everyday routines so hard to keep up with. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re frustrated. How else do you feel this has been affecting your overall well-being or the ways you cope day to day?\nPatient: The fatigue and irritability do more than just wear me out physically\u2014they mess with my head too. I find myself getting short-tempered more often, which just drives me into shutting down socially. That isolation only makes everything feel worse. The coping strategies I once relied on aren\u2019t working like they used to, and I\u2019m getting annoyed way quicker than before.

It\u2019s enough to slow me down and makes it harder to get anything done without feeling annoyed at myself. It\u2019s not a crash-and-burn situation, but it definitely adds to the daily frustration and makes things more difficult than they should be.\nDoctor: Understood\u2014it sounds like these cognitive issues, while not overwhelming, still weigh on you and complicate daily tasks. How severe would you say these problems with focus and making choices are on most days?\nPatient: They\u2019re definitely a significant nuisance on most days\u2014enough to slow me down and wear on my patience\u2014but not so severe that I can\u2019t manage. It\u2019s frustrating to have to work harder to get through routine tasks, but it\u2019s something I handle, even if it drains me more than it should.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014these issues slow you down and test your patience but don\u2019t completely stop you. How often do you feel fatigued or low on energy, and how much does that affect your daily functioning?\nPatient: Fatigue hits me pretty often \u2014 enough to seriously drain my energy and endurance throughout the day. It\u2019s a real pain having to push through feeling worn out, and it definitely makes me more irritable than I\u2019d like. Keeping up with daily routines feels tougher, and it all just builds up on itself.\nDoctor: Sounds like that fatigue is a big factor wearing you down. How often during the day does this tiredness hit you, and what do you do to try and manage it along with the irritability?\nPatient: The tiredness hits me multiple times a day, draining whatever energy I have left. It feeds right into the irritability, so it\u2019s like a vicious cycle I can\u2019t shake. I try to push through \u2014 taking breaks, pacing myself \u2014 but those strategies only get me so far. At the end of the day, it still makes it harder to keep up with routines, even if I\u2019m managing just barely. It\u2019s frustrating, to say the least.\nDoctor: That ongoing cycle of fatigue and irritability sounds incredibly draining, Martin, especially when it\u2019s making everyday routines so hard to keep up with. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re frustrated. How else do you feel this has been affecting your overall well-being or the ways you cope day to day?\nPatient: The fatigue and irritability do more than just wear me out physically\u2014they mess with my head too. I find myself getting short-tempered more often, which just drives me into shutting down socially. That isolation only makes everything feel worse. The coping strategies I once relied on aren\u2019t working like they used to, and I\u2019m getting annoyed way quicker than before. It feels like I\u2019m barely holding onto any sense of normalcy or control, and that just piles on more stress and frustration every day.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014short temper and social withdrawal both feeding into the stress and frustration. Since good sleep plays a big role in this, tell me more about your sleep troubles: what\u2019s the nature of your insomnia or restlessness at night, how often does it happen, and how much does it impact you the next day?\nPatient: Falling asleep is a battle most nights\u2014my mind races no matter what I try, and it\u2019s like there\u2019s no off switch. Once I finally drift off, I don\u2019t stay asleep for long; I wake up multiple times because of restlessness that just won\u2019t quit. The next day? I\u2019m drained, irritable, and my patience is worn thin before I even step outside. That exhaustion makes me avoid people more, which feeds the whole cycle. I\u2019ve tried different ways to manage the sleep issues, but honestly, none of it\u2019s done much good. This cycle just keeps dragging me down harder every day.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nFalling asleep is a battle most nights\u2014my mind races no matter what I try, and it\u2019s like there\u2019s no off switch.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Look, the mood\u2019s been a constant dark cloud most days\u2014six to ten days recently, if I\u2019m honest. Sleep\u2019s a nightmare; it\u2019s been dragging on just as long, restless nights that leave me wired and frustrated. The psychomotor agitation shows up now and then, not too often, but enough to be noticeable. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at, straightforward enough.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straightforward about this, Martin. Can you tell me more about how the restless sleep and that agitation are impacting your day-to-day life and your energy overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s a constant grind\u2014when I don\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m running on empty all day, and that tiredness just turns into raw irritability. I snap at small things and find it nearly impossible to focus on anything meaningful. The restlessness hits in waves; I can\u2019t sit still, which drives me nuts because it\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t shut off, and I\u2019m stuck pacing or shifting around without relief. It screws with any routine or personal projects I try to do, and honestly, it piles on more stress instead of easing anything. It\u2019s aggravating to feel this dragged down and restless at the same time\u2014it\u2019s a lousy combination for getting anything done or feeling even halfway decent.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue and restlessness sounds really tough and draining, especially when it\u2019s interfering with your routines and projects. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight since these symptoms started? It\u2019s important to get a full picture for how your depression might be affecting you.\nPatient: No, there haven\u2019t been any changes in my appetite or weight. That part\u2019s stayed steady.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014appetite and weight are steady. Now, have you been feeling a lot of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s important to hear how you\u2019re thinking about yourself during this time.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve felt worthless at times. It\u2019s frustrating because I know it\u2019s not productive, but it\u2019s there\u2014like this nagging voice that reminds me I\u2019m not what I used to be. It doesn\u2019t spiral into guilt or anything dramatic, just this tired sense that I\u2019m falling short or not measuring up. I don\u2019t dwell on it too much, but it\u2019s definitely part of the background noise.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that nagging sense of not measuring up is for you. How often does this feeling of worthlessness show up, and when it does, how strongly does it affect your motivation or even how you take care of yourself day to day?\nPatient: It pops up now and then, not all the time\u2014but enough to be annoying. It\u2019s more like this low hum in the background than a full-blown takeover. When it hits, motivation definitely takes a hit, but I still manage to keep up with the basics. I\u2019m not falling apart or anything, just frustrated that it drags me down more than it should.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that\u2014sounds like it's a steady drain, even if not overwhelming. How about your interest or pleasure in things you usually enjoy? Are you still finding some satisfaction in your usual activities, like your volunteer work at the library?\nPatient: Yeah, I still get some satisfaction from the volunteer work at the library, but it\u2019s nowhere near what it used to be. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to stay engaged, but the motivation wavers a lot. I have to push myself more than I\u2019d like just to keep up with it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve given up completely, but it\u2019s definitely been a struggle.\nDoctor: It sounds like your connection to the volunteering has taken a hit, even if you\u2019re still holding on to it. How has that drop in pleasure and drive changed over time, and what kind of impact is it having on your day-to-day mood and functioning?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a gradual decline\u2014little by little, the pleasure I used to get from volunteering has faded, and the drive to stay involved comes and goes. Some days I\u2019m able to push through, but other times it feels like a real effort just to show up. It\u2019s not always obvious on the surface, but that constant background frustration wears on me. It\u2019s this subtle weight dragging down my mood and making day-to-day functioning more of a chore than it should be.\nDoctor: That subtle but constant weight you describe can be really hard to carry day in and day out. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to talk about, and I want you to know you\u2019re in a safe space here.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts about death or suicide recently. Just so we\u2019re clear.\nDoctor: Thanks for being clear on that. Have you noticed any trouble concentrating or making decisions lately? Understanding this helps get a full picture of how things might be affecting your daily life.\nPatient: Yeah, trouble concentrating and making decisions comes up fairly often.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Look, the mood\u2019s been a constant dark cloud most days\u2014six to ten days recently, if I\u2019m honest. Sleep\u2019s a nightmare; it\u2019s been dragging on just as long, restless nights that leave me wired and frustrated. The psychomotor agitation shows up now and then, not too often, but enough to be noticeable. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at, straightforward enough.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straightforward about this, Martin. Can you tell me more about how the restless sleep and that agitation are impacting your day-to-day life and your energy overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s a constant grind\u2014when I don\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m running on empty all day, and that tiredness just turns into raw irritability. I snap at small things and find it nearly impossible to focus on anything meaningful. The restlessness hits in waves; I can\u2019t sit still, which drives me nuts because it\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t shut off, and I\u2019m stuck pacing or shifting around without relief. It screws with any routine or personal projects I try to do, and honestly, it piles on more stress instead of easing anything. It\u2019s aggravating to feel this dragged down and restless at the same time\u2014it\u2019s a lousy combination for getting anything done or feeling even halfway decent.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue and restlessness sounds really tough and draining, especially when it\u2019s interfering with your routines and projects. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight since these symptoms started? It\u2019s important to get a full picture for how your depression might be affecting you.\nPatient: No, there haven\u2019t been any changes in my appetite or weight. That part\u2019s stayed steady.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014appetite and weight are steady. Now, have you been feeling a lot of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s important to hear how you\u2019re thinking about yourself during this time.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve felt worthless at times. It\u2019s frustrating because I know it\u2019s not productive, but it\u2019s there\u2014like this nagging voice that reminds me I\u2019m not what I used to be. It doesn\u2019t spiral into guilt or anything dramatic, just this tired sense that I\u2019m falling short or not measuring up. I don\u2019t dwell on it too much, but it\u2019s definitely part of the background noise.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that nagging sense of not measuring up is for you. How often does this feeling of worthlessness show up, and when it does, how strongly does it affect your motivation or even how you take care of yourself day to day?\nPatient: It pops up now and then, not all the time\u2014but enough to be annoying. It\u2019s more like this low hum in the background than a full-blown takeover. When it hits, motivation definitely takes a hit, but I still manage to keep up with the basics. I\u2019m not falling apart or anything, just frustrated that it drags me down more than it should.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that\u2014sounds like it's a steady drain, even if not overwhelming. How about your interest or pleasure in things you usually enjoy? Are you still finding some satisfaction in your usual activities, like your volunteer work at the library?\nPatient: Yeah, I still get some satisfaction from the volunteer work at the library, but it\u2019s nowhere near what it used to be. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to stay engaged, but the motivation wavers a lot. I have to push myself more than I\u2019d like just to keep up with it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve given up completely, but it\u2019s definitely been a struggle.\nDoctor: It sounds like your connection to the volunteering has taken a hit, even if you\u2019re still holding on to it. How has that drop in pleasure and drive changed over time, and what kind of impact is it having on your day-to-day mood and functioning?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a gradual decline\u2014little by little, the pleasure I used to get from volunteering has faded, and the drive to stay involved comes and goes. Some days I\u2019m able to push through, but other times it feels like a real effort just to show up. It\u2019s not always obvious on the surface, but that constant background frustration wears on me. It\u2019s this subtle weight dragging down my mood and making day-to-day functioning more of a chore than it should be.\nDoctor: That subtle but constant weight you describe can be really hard to carry day in and day out. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to talk about, and I want you to know you\u2019re in a safe space here.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts about death or suicide recently. Just so we\u2019re clear.\nDoctor: Thanks for being clear on that. Have you noticed any trouble concentrating or making decisions lately? Understanding this helps get a full picture of how things might be affecting your daily life.\nPatient: Yeah, trouble concentrating and making decisions comes up fairly often. It\u2019s enough to slow me down and makes it harder to get anything done without feeling annoyed at myself. It\u2019s not a crash-and-burn situation, but it definitely adds to the daily frustration and makes things more difficult than they should be.\nDoctor: Understood\u2014it sounds like these cognitive issues, while not overwhelming, still weigh on you and complicate daily tasks. How severe would you say these problems with focus and making choices are on most days?\nPatient: They\u2019re definitely a significant nuisance on most days\u2014enough to slow me down and wear on my patience\u2014but not so severe that I can\u2019t manage. It\u2019s frustrating to have to work harder to get through routine tasks, but it\u2019s something I handle, even if it drains me more than it should.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014these issues slow you down and test your patience but don\u2019t completely stop you. How often do you feel fatigued or low on energy, and how much does that affect your daily functioning?\nPatient: Fatigue hits me pretty often \u2014 enough to seriously drain my energy and endurance throughout the day. It\u2019s a real pain having to push through feeling worn out, and it definitely makes me more irritable than I\u2019d like. Keeping up with daily routines feels tougher, and it all just builds up on itself.\nDoctor: Sounds like that fatigue is a big factor wearing you down. How often during the day does this tiredness hit you, and what do you do to try and manage it along with the irritability?\nPatient: The tiredness hits me multiple times a day, draining whatever energy I have left. It feeds right into the irritability, so it\u2019s like a vicious cycle I can\u2019t shake. I try to push through \u2014 taking breaks, pacing myself \u2014 but those strategies only get me so far. At the end of the day, it still makes it harder to keep up with routines, even if I\u2019m managing just barely. It\u2019s frustrating, to say the least.\nDoctor: That ongoing cycle of fatigue and irritability sounds incredibly draining, Martin, especially when it\u2019s making everyday routines so hard to keep up with. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re frustrated. How else do you feel this has been affecting your overall well-being or the ways you cope day to day?\nPatient: The fatigue and irritability do more than just wear me out physically\u2014they mess with my head too. I find myself getting short-tempered more often, which just drives me into shutting down socially. That isolation only makes everything feel worse. The coping strategies I once relied on aren\u2019t working like they used to, and I\u2019m getting annoyed way quicker than before. It feels like I\u2019m barely holding onto any sense of normalcy or control, and that just piles on more stress and frustration every day.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014short temper and social withdrawal both feeding into the stress and frustration. Since good sleep plays a big role in this, tell me more about your sleep troubles: what\u2019s the nature of your insomnia or restlessness at night, how often does it happen, and how much does it impact you the next day?\nPatient: Falling asleep is a battle most nights\u2014my mind races no matter what I try, and it\u2019s like there\u2019s no off switch. Once I finally drift off, I don\u2019t stay asleep for long; I wake up multiple times because of restlessness that just won\u2019t quit. The next day? I\u2019m drained, irritable, and my patience is worn thin before I even step outside. That exhaustion makes me avoid people more, which feeds the whole cycle. I\u2019ve tried different ways to manage the sleep issues, but honestly, none of it\u2019s done much good. This cycle just keeps dragging me down harder every day.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Martin. You mentioned restlessness and difficulty staying asleep\u2014how often do you find yourself physically unable to sit still or feeling slowed down in your movements during the day? This can help me understand more about your psychomotor symptoms.\nPatient: The restlessness hits multiple times during the day\u2014I can\u2019t sit still for long without pacing or shifting constantly. It drives me crazy because it\u2019s impossible to just relax or focus. Slowed movements happen too, but nowhere near as often as the restlessness. Either way, it\u2019s frustrating and makes everything feel ten times harder to handle.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",

Since good sleep plays a big role in this, tell me more about your sleep troubles: what\u2019s the nature of your insomnia or restlessness at night, how often does it happen, and how much does it impact you the next day?\nPatient: Falling asleep is a battle most nights\u2014my mind races no matter what I try, and it\u2019s like there\u2019s no off switch. Once I finally drift off, I don\u2019t stay asleep for long; I wake up multiple times because of restlessness that just won\u2019t quit. The next day? I\u2019m drained, irritable, and my patience is worn thin before I even step outside. That exhaustion makes me avoid people more, which feeds the whole cycle. I\u2019ve tried different ways to manage the sleep issues, but honestly, none of it\u2019s done much good. This cycle just keeps dragging me down harder every day.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Martin. You mentioned restlessness and difficulty staying asleep\u2014how often do you find yourself physically unable to sit still or feeling slowed down in your movements during the day? This can help me understand more about your psychomotor symptoms.\nPatient: The restlessness hits multiple times during the day\u2014I can\u2019t sit still for long without pacing or shifting constantly. It drives me crazy because it\u2019s impossible to just relax or focus. Slowed movements happen too, but nowhere near as often as the restlessness. Either way, it\u2019s frustrating and makes everything feel ten times harder to handle.\nDoctor: You\u2019re managing a lot, Martin\u2014constantly battling restlessness along with fatigue and irritability takes real effort, and it\u2019s clear it\u2019s wearing you down. I want you to know I hear you, and it\u2019s not easy facing all this day after day.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Look, the mood\u2019s been a constant dark cloud most days\u2014six to ten days recently, if I\u2019m honest. Sleep\u2019s a nightmare; it\u2019s been dragging on just as long, restless nights that leave me wired and frustrated. The psychomotor agitation shows up now and then, not too often, but enough to be noticeable. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at, straightforward enough.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straightforward about this, Martin. Can you tell me more about how the restless sleep and that agitation are impacting your day-to-day life and your energy overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s a constant grind\u2014when I don\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m running on empty all day, and that tiredness just turns into raw irritability. I snap at small things and find it nearly impossible to focus on anything meaningful. The restlessness hits in waves; I can\u2019t sit still, which drives me nuts because it\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t shut off, and I\u2019m stuck pacing or shifting around without relief. It screws with any routine or personal projects I try to do, and honestly, it piles on more stress instead of easing anything. It\u2019s aggravating to feel this dragged down and restless at the same time\u2014it\u2019s a lousy combination for getting anything done or feeling even halfway decent.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue and restlessness sounds really tough and draining, especially when it\u2019s interfering with your routines and projects. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight since these symptoms started? It\u2019s important to get a full picture for how your depression might be affecting you.\nPatient: No, there haven\u2019t been any changes in my appetite or weight. That part\u2019s stayed steady.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014appetite and weight are steady. Now, have you been feeling a lot of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s important to hear how you\u2019re thinking about yourself during this time.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve felt worthless at times. It\u2019s frustrating because I know it\u2019s not productive, but it\u2019s there\u2014like this nagging voice that reminds me I\u2019m not what I used to be. It doesn\u2019t spiral into guilt or anything dramatic, just this tired sense that I\u2019m falling short or not measuring up. I don\u2019t dwell on it too much, but it\u2019s definitely part of the background noise.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that nagging sense of not measuring up is for you. How often does this feeling of worthlessness show up, and when it does, how strongly does it affect your motivation or even how you take care of yourself day to day?\nPatient: It pops up now and then, not all the time\u2014but enough to be annoying. It\u2019s more like this low hum in the background than a full-blown takeover. When it hits, motivation definitely takes a hit, but I still manage to keep up with the basics. I\u2019m not falling apart or anything, just frustrated that it drags me down more than it should.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that\u2014sounds like it's a steady drain, even if not overwhelming. How about your interest or pleasure in things you usually enjoy? Are you still finding some satisfaction in your usual activities, like your volunteer work at the library?\nPatient: Yeah, I still get some satisfaction from the volunteer work at the library, but it\u2019s nowhere near what it used to be. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to stay engaged, but the motivation wavers a lot. I have to push myself more than I\u2019d like just to keep up with it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve given up completely, but it\u2019s definitely been a struggle.\nDoctor: It sounds like your connection to the volunteering has taken a hit, even if you\u2019re still holding on to it. How has that drop in pleasure and drive changed over time, and what kind of impact is it having on your day-to-day mood and functioning?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a gradual decline\u2014little by little, the pleasure I used to get from volunteering has faded, and the drive to stay involved comes and goes. Some days I\u2019m able to push through, but other times it feels like a real effort just to show up. It\u2019s not always obvious on the surface, but that constant background frustration wears on me. It\u2019s this subtle weight dragging down my mood and making day-to-day functioning more of a chore than it should be.\nDoctor: That subtle but constant weight you describe can be really hard to carry day in and day out. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to talk about, and I want you to know you\u2019re in a safe space here.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts about death or suicide recently. Just so we\u2019re clear.\nDoctor: Thanks for being clear on that. Have you noticed any trouble concentrating or making decisions lately? Understanding this helps get a full picture of how things might be affecting your daily life.\nPatient: Yeah, trouble concentrating and making decisions comes up fairly often. It\u2019s enough to slow me down and makes it harder to get anything done without feeling annoyed at myself. It\u2019s not a crash-and-burn situation, but it definitely adds to the daily frustration and makes things more difficult than they should be.\nDoctor: Understood\u2014it sounds like these cognitive issues, while not overwhelming, still weigh on you and complicate daily tasks. How severe would you say these problems with focus and making choices are on most days?\nPatient: They\u2019re definitely a significant nuisance on most days\u2014enough to slow me down and wear on my patience\u2014but not so severe that I can\u2019t manage. It\u2019s frustrating to have to work harder to get through routine tasks, but it\u2019s something I handle, even if it drains me more than it should.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014these issues slow you down and test your patience but don\u2019t completely stop you. How often do you feel fatigued or low on energy, and how much does that affect your daily functioning?\nPatient: Fatigue hits me pretty often \u2014 enough to seriously drain my energy and endurance throughout the day. It\u2019s a real pain having to push through feeling worn out, and it definitely makes me more irritable than I\u2019d like. Keeping up with daily routines feels tougher, and it all just builds up on itself.\nDoctor: Sounds like that fatigue is a big factor wearing you down. How often during the day does this tiredness hit you, and what do you do to try and manage it along with the irritability?\nPatient: The tiredness hits me multiple times a day, draining whatever energy I have left. It feeds right into the irritability, so it\u2019s like a vicious cycle I can\u2019t shake. I try to push through \u2014 taking breaks, pacing myself \u2014 but those strategies only get me so far. At the end of the day, it still makes it harder to keep up with routines, even if I\u2019m managing just barely. It\u2019s frustrating, to say the least.\nDoctor: That ongoing cycle of fatigue and irritability sounds incredibly draining, Martin, especially when it\u2019s making everyday routines so hard to keep up with. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re frustrated. How else do you feel this has been affecting your overall well-being or the ways you cope day to day?\nPatient: The fatigue and irritability do more than just wear me out physically\u2014they mess with my head too. I find myself getting short-tempered more often, which just drives me into shutting down socially. That isolation only makes everything feel worse. The coping strategies I once relied on aren\u2019t working like they used to, and I\u2019m getting annoyed way quicker than before. It feels like I\u2019m barely holding onto any sense of normalcy or control, and that just piles on more stress and frustration every day.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014short temper and social withdrawal both feeding into the stress and frustration.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Look, the mood\u2019s been a constant dark cloud most days\u2014six to ten days recently, if I\u2019m honest. Sleep\u2019s a nightmare; it\u2019s been dragging on just as long, restless nights that leave me wired and frustrated. The psychomotor agitation shows up now and then, not too often, but enough to be noticeable. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at, straightforward enough.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straightforward about this, Martin. Can you tell me more about how the restless sleep and that agitation are impacting your day-to-day life and your energy overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s a constant grind\u2014when I don\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m running on empty all day, and that tiredness just turns into raw irritability. I snap at small things and find it nearly impossible to focus on anything meaningful. The restlessness hits in waves; I can\u2019t sit still, which drives me nuts because it\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t shut off, and I\u2019m stuck pacing or shifting around without relief. It screws with any routine or personal projects I try to do, and honestly, it piles on more stress instead of easing anything. It\u2019s aggravating to feel this dragged down and restless at the same time\u2014it\u2019s a lousy combination for getting anything done or feeling even halfway decent.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue and restlessness sounds really tough and draining, especially when it\u2019s interfering with your routines and projects. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight since these symptoms started? It\u2019s important to get a full picture for how your depression might be affecting you.\nPatient: No, there haven\u2019t been any changes in my appetite or weight. That part\u2019s stayed steady.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014appetite and weight are steady. Now, have you been feeling a lot of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s important to hear how you\u2019re thinking about yourself during this time.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve felt worthless at times. It\u2019s frustrating because I know it\u2019s not productive, but it\u2019s there\u2014like this nagging voice that reminds me I\u2019m not what I used to be. It doesn\u2019t spiral into guilt or anything dramatic, just this tired sense that I\u2019m falling short or not measuring up. I don\u2019t dwell on it too much, but it\u2019s definitely part of the background noise.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that nagging sense of not measuring up is for you. How often does this feeling of worthlessness show up, and when it does, how strongly does it affect your motivation or even how you take care of yourself day to day?\nPatient: It pops up now and then, not all the time\u2014but enough to be annoying. It\u2019s more like this low hum in the background than a full-blown takeover. When it hits, motivation definitely takes a hit, but I still manage to keep up with the basics. I\u2019m not falling apart or anything, just frustrated that it drags me down more than it should.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that\u2014sounds like it's a steady drain, even if not overwhelming. How about your interest or pleasure in things you usually enjoy? Are you still finding some satisfaction in your usual activities, like your volunteer work at the library?\nPatient: Yeah, I still get some satisfaction from the volunteer work at the library, but it\u2019s nowhere near what it used to be. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to stay engaged, but the motivation wavers a lot. I have to push myself more than I\u2019d like just to keep up with it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve given up completely, but it\u2019s definitely been a struggle.\nDoctor: It sounds like your connection to the volunteering has taken a hit, even if you\u2019re still holding on to it. How has that drop in pleasure and drive changed over time, and what kind of impact is it having on your day-to-day mood and functioning?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a gradual decline\u2014little by little, the pleasure I used to get from volunteering has faded, and the drive to stay involved comes and goes. Some days I\u2019m able to push through, but other times it feels like a real effort just to show up. It\u2019s not always obvious on the surface, but that constant background frustration wears on me. It\u2019s this subtle weight dragging down my mood and making day-to-day functioning more of a chore than it should be.\nDoctor: That subtle but constant weight you describe can be really hard to carry day in and day out. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to talk about, and I want you to know you\u2019re in a safe space here.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts about death or suicide recently. Just so we\u2019re clear.\nDoctor: Thanks for being clear on that. Have you noticed any trouble concentrating or making decisions lately? Understanding this helps get a full picture of how things might be affecting your daily life.\nPatient: Yeah, trouble concentrating and making decisions comes up fairly often. It\u2019s enough to slow me down and makes it harder to get anything done without feeling annoyed at myself. It\u2019s not a crash-and-burn situation, but it definitely adds to the daily frustration and makes things more difficult than they should be.\nDoctor: Understood\u2014it sounds like these cognitive issues, while not overwhelming, still weigh on you and complicate daily tasks. How severe would you say these problems with focus and making choices are on most days?\nPatient: They\u2019re definitely a significant nuisance on most days\u2014enough to slow me down and wear on my patience\u2014but not so severe that I can\u2019t manage. It\u2019s frustrating to have to work harder to get through routine tasks, but it\u2019s something I handle, even if it drains me more than it should.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014these issues slow you down and test your patience but don\u2019t completely stop you. How often do you feel fatigued or low on energy, and how much does that affect your daily functioning?\nPatient: Fatigue hits me pretty often \u2014 enough to seriously drain my energy and endurance throughout the day. It\u2019s a real pain having to push through feeling worn out, and it definitely makes me more irritable than I\u2019d like. Keeping up with daily routines feels tougher, and it all just builds up on itself.\nDoctor: Sounds like that fatigue is a big factor wearing you down. How often during the day does this tiredness hit you, and what do you do to try and manage it along with the irritability?\nPatient: The tiredness hits me multiple times a day, draining whatever energy I have left. It feeds right into the irritability, so it\u2019s like a vicious cycle I can\u2019t shake. I try to push through \u2014 taking breaks, pacing myself \u2014 but those strategies only get me so far. At the end of the day, it still makes it harder to keep up with routines, even if I\u2019m managing just barely. It\u2019s frustrating, to say the least.\nDoctor: That ongoing cycle of fatigue and irritability sounds incredibly draining, Martin, especially when it\u2019s making everyday routines so hard to keep up with. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re frustrated. How else do you feel this has been affecting your overall well-being or the ways you cope day to day?\nPatient: The fatigue and irritability do more than just wear me out physically\u2014they mess with my head too. I find myself getting short-tempered more often, which just drives me into shutting down socially. That isolation only makes everything feel worse. The coping strategies I once relied on aren\u2019t working like they used to, and I\u2019m getting annoyed way quicker than before. It feels like I\u2019m barely holding onto any sense of normalcy or control, and that just piles on more stress and frustration every day.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014short temper and social withdrawal both feeding into the stress and frustration. Since good sleep plays a big role in this, tell me more about your sleep troubles: what\u2019s the nature of your insomnia or restlessness at night, how often does it happen, and how much does it impact you the next day?\nPatient: Falling asleep is a battle most nights\u2014my mind races no matter what I try, and it\u2019s like there\u2019s no off switch. Once I finally drift off, I don\u2019t stay asleep for long; I wake up multiple times because of restlessness that just won\u2019t quit. The next day? I\u2019m drained, irritable, and my patience is worn thin before I even step outside. That exhaustion makes me avoid people more, which feeds the whole cycle. I\u2019ve tried different ways to manage the sleep issues, but honestly, none of it\u2019s done much good. This cycle just keeps dragging me down harder every day.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Martin. You mentioned restlessness and difficulty staying asleep\u2014how often do you find yourself physically unable to sit still or feeling slowed down in your movements during the day? This can help me understand more about your psychomotor symptoms.\nPatient: The restlessness hits multiple times during the day\u2014I can\u2019t sit still for long without pacing or shifting constantly. It drives me crazy because it\u2019s impossible to just relax or focus. Slowed movements happen too, but nowhere near as often as the restlessness. Either way, it\u2019s frustrating and makes everything feel ten times harder to handle.\nDoctor: You\u2019re managing a lot, Martin\u2014constantly battling restlessness along with fatigue and irritability takes real effort, and it\u2019s clear it\u2019s wearing you down. I want you to know I hear you, and it\u2019s not easy facing all this day after day. We\u2019ll work on a plan to help ease some of this burden.\nPatient: I appreciate that you hear me, but honestly, it\u2019s frustrating to have been fighting this for so long with little to show for it. I\u2019m tired of constantly pushing myself just to keep going. I\u2019m cautiously hopeful that whatever plan we come up with might actually bring some relief, but after all this, I\u2019m not holding my breath. Still, I\u2019m willing to give it a shot.\nDoctor: I understand how exhausting and discouraging this has been for you, Martin. It takes a lot to keep pushing through, and I respect your perseverance and cautious hope. We\u2019ll work together to find an approach that truly makes a difference.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nI understand how exhausting and discouraging this has been for you, Martin.

It\u2019s not a crash-and-burn situation, but it definitely adds to the daily frustration and makes things more difficult than they should be.\nDoctor: Understood\u2014it sounds like these cognitive issues, while not overwhelming, still weigh on you and complicate daily tasks. How severe would you say these problems with focus and making choices are on most days?\nPatient: They\u2019re definitely a significant nuisance on most days\u2014enough to slow me down and wear on my patience\u2014but not so severe that I can\u2019t manage. It\u2019s frustrating to have to work harder to get through routine tasks, but it\u2019s something I handle, even if it drains me more than it should.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014these issues slow you down and test your patience but don\u2019t completely stop you. How often do you feel fatigued or low on energy, and how much does that affect your daily functioning?\nPatient: Fatigue hits me pretty often \u2014 enough to seriously drain my energy and endurance throughout the day. It\u2019s a real pain having to push through feeling worn out, and it definitely makes me more irritable than I\u2019d like. Keeping up with daily routines feels tougher, and it all just builds up on itself.\nDoctor: Sounds like that fatigue is a big factor wearing you down. How often during the day does this tiredness hit you, and what do you do to try and manage it along with the irritability?\nPatient: The tiredness hits me multiple times a day, draining whatever energy I have left. It feeds right into the irritability, so it\u2019s like a vicious cycle I can\u2019t shake. I try to push through \u2014 taking breaks, pacing myself \u2014 but those strategies only get me so far. At the end of the day, it still makes it harder to keep up with routines, even if I\u2019m managing just barely. It\u2019s frustrating, to say the least.\nDoctor: That ongoing cycle of fatigue and irritability sounds incredibly draining, Martin, especially when it\u2019s making everyday routines so hard to keep up with. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re frustrated. How else do you feel this has been affecting your overall well-being or the ways you cope day to day?\nPatient: The fatigue and irritability do more than just wear me out physically\u2014they mess with my head too. I find myself getting short-tempered more often, which just drives me into shutting down socially. That isolation only makes everything feel worse. The coping strategies I once relied on aren\u2019t working like they used to, and I\u2019m getting annoyed way quicker than before. It feels like I\u2019m barely holding onto any sense of normalcy or control, and that just piles on more stress and frustration every day.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014short temper and social withdrawal both feeding into the stress and frustration. Since good sleep plays a big role in this, tell me more about your sleep troubles: what\u2019s the nature of your insomnia or restlessness at night, how often does it happen, and how much does it impact you the next day?\nPatient: Falling asleep is a battle most nights\u2014my mind races no matter what I try, and it\u2019s like there\u2019s no off switch. Once I finally drift off, I don\u2019t stay asleep for long; I wake up multiple times because of restlessness that just won\u2019t quit. The next day? I\u2019m drained, irritable, and my patience is worn thin before I even step outside. That exhaustion makes me avoid people more, which feeds the whole cycle. I\u2019ve tried different ways to manage the sleep issues, but honestly, none of it\u2019s done much good. This cycle just keeps dragging me down harder every day.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Martin. You mentioned restlessness and difficulty staying asleep\u2014how often do you find yourself physically unable to sit still or feeling slowed down in your movements during the day? This can help me understand more about your psychomotor symptoms.\nPatient: The restlessness hits multiple times during the day\u2014I can\u2019t sit still for long without pacing or shifting constantly. It drives me crazy because it\u2019s impossible to just relax or focus. Slowed movements happen too, but nowhere near as often as the restlessness. Either way, it\u2019s frustrating and makes everything feel ten times harder to handle.\nDoctor: You\u2019re managing a lot, Martin\u2014constantly battling restlessness along with fatigue and irritability takes real effort, and it\u2019s clear it\u2019s wearing you down. I want you to know I hear you, and it\u2019s not easy facing all this day after day. We\u2019ll work on a plan to help ease some of this burden.\nPatient: I appreciate that you hear me, but honestly, it\u2019s frustrating to have been fighting this for so long with little to show for it. I\u2019m tired of constantly pushing myself just to keep going. I\u2019m cautiously hopeful that whatever plan we come up with might actually bring some relief, but after all this, I\u2019m not holding my breath. Still, I\u2019m willing to give it a shot.\nDoctor: I understand how exhausting and discouraging this has been for you, Martin. It takes a lot to keep pushing through, and I respect your perseverance and cautious hope. We\u2019ll work together to find an approach that truly makes a difference.\nPatient: It\u2019s been a long haul, and I\u2019m frustrated with how much energy it takes just to keep going without really getting better. I\u2019m willing to try whatever you suggest, but I\u2019m skeptical it\u2019ll bring the kind of change I need.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Look, the mood\u2019s been a constant dark cloud most days\u2014six to ten days recently, if I\u2019m honest. Sleep\u2019s a nightmare; it\u2019s been dragging on just as long, restless nights that leave me wired and frustrated. The psychomotor agitation shows up now and then, not too often, but enough to be noticeable. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at, straightforward enough.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straightforward about this, Martin. Can you tell me more about how the restless sleep and that agitation are impacting your day-to-day life and your energy overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s a constant grind\u2014when I don\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m running on empty all day, and that tiredness just turns into raw irritability. I snap at small things and find it nearly impossible to focus on anything meaningful. The restlessness hits in waves; I can\u2019t sit still, which drives me nuts because it\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t shut off, and I\u2019m stuck pacing or shifting around without relief. It screws with any routine or personal projects I try to do, and honestly, it piles on more stress instead of easing anything. It\u2019s aggravating to feel this dragged down and restless at the same time\u2014it\u2019s a lousy combination for getting anything done or feeling even halfway decent.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue and restlessness sounds really tough and draining, especially when it\u2019s interfering with your routines and projects. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight since these symptoms started? It\u2019s important to get a full picture for how your depression might be affecting you.\nPatient: No, there haven\u2019t been any changes in my appetite or weight. That part\u2019s stayed steady.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014appetite and weight are steady. Now, have you been feeling a lot of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s important to hear how you\u2019re thinking about yourself during this time.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve felt worthless at times. It\u2019s frustrating because I know it\u2019s not productive, but it\u2019s there\u2014like this nagging voice that reminds me I\u2019m not what I used to be. It doesn\u2019t spiral into guilt or anything dramatic, just this tired sense that I\u2019m falling short or not measuring up. I don\u2019t dwell on it too much, but it\u2019s definitely part of the background noise.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that nagging sense of not measuring up is for you. How often does this feeling of worthlessness show up, and when it does, how strongly does it affect your motivation or even how you take care of yourself day to day?\nPatient: It pops up now and then, not all the time\u2014but enough to be annoying. It\u2019s more like this low hum in the background than a full-blown takeover. When it hits, motivation definitely takes a hit, but I still manage to keep up with the basics. I\u2019m not falling apart or anything, just frustrated that it drags me down more than it should.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that\u2014sounds like it's a steady drain, even if not overwhelming. How about your interest or pleasure in things you usually enjoy? Are you still finding some satisfaction in your usual activities, like your volunteer work at the library?\nPatient: Yeah, I still get some satisfaction from the volunteer work at the library, but it\u2019s nowhere near what it used to be. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to stay engaged, but the motivation wavers a lot. I have to push myself more than I\u2019d like just to keep up with it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve given up completely, but it\u2019s definitely been a struggle.\nDoctor: It sounds like your connection to the volunteering has taken a hit, even if you\u2019re still holding on to it. How has that drop in pleasure and drive changed over time, and what kind of impact is it having on your day-to-day mood and functioning?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a gradual decline\u2014little by little, the pleasure I used to get from volunteering has faded, and the drive to stay involved comes and goes. Some days I\u2019m able to push through, but other times it feels like a real effort just to show up. It\u2019s not always obvious on the surface, but that constant background frustration wears on me. It\u2019s this subtle weight dragging down my mood and making day-to-day functioning more of a chore than it should be.\nDoctor: That subtle but constant weight you describe can be really hard to carry day in and day out. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to talk about, and I want you to know you\u2019re in a safe space here.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts about death or suicide recently. Just so we\u2019re clear.\nDoctor: Thanks for being clear on that. Have you noticed any trouble concentrating or making decisions lately? Understanding this helps get a full picture of how things might be affecting your daily life.\nPatient: Yeah, trouble concentrating and making decisions comes up fairly often.

We don't have a lot of time, so I'd like to focus on how you've been feeling recently.\nPatient: Look, the mood\u2019s been a constant dark cloud most days\u2014six to ten days recently, if I\u2019m honest. Sleep\u2019s a nightmare; it\u2019s been dragging on just as long, restless nights that leave me wired and frustrated. The psychomotor agitation shows up now and then, not too often, but enough to be noticeable. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at, straightforward enough.\nDoctor: Thanks for being straightforward about this, Martin. Can you tell me more about how the restless sleep and that agitation are impacting your day-to-day life and your energy overall?\nPatient: It\u2019s a constant grind\u2014when I don\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m running on empty all day, and that tiredness just turns into raw irritability. I snap at small things and find it nearly impossible to focus on anything meaningful. The restlessness hits in waves; I can\u2019t sit still, which drives me nuts because it\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t shut off, and I\u2019m stuck pacing or shifting around without relief. It screws with any routine or personal projects I try to do, and honestly, it piles on more stress instead of easing anything. It\u2019s aggravating to feel this dragged down and restless at the same time\u2014it\u2019s a lousy combination for getting anything done or feeling even halfway decent.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue and restlessness sounds really tough and draining, especially when it\u2019s interfering with your routines and projects. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight since these symptoms started? It\u2019s important to get a full picture for how your depression might be affecting you.\nPatient: No, there haven\u2019t been any changes in my appetite or weight. That part\u2019s stayed steady.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014appetite and weight are steady. Now, have you been feeling a lot of worthlessness or excessive guilt lately? It\u2019s important to hear how you\u2019re thinking about yourself during this time.\nPatient: Yeah, I\u2019ve felt worthless at times. It\u2019s frustrating because I know it\u2019s not productive, but it\u2019s there\u2014like this nagging voice that reminds me I\u2019m not what I used to be. It doesn\u2019t spiral into guilt or anything dramatic, just this tired sense that I\u2019m falling short or not measuring up. I don\u2019t dwell on it too much, but it\u2019s definitely part of the background noise.\nDoctor: I can hear how frustrating that nagging sense of not measuring up is for you. How often does this feeling of worthlessness show up, and when it does, how strongly does it affect your motivation or even how you take care of yourself day to day?\nPatient: It pops up now and then, not all the time\u2014but enough to be annoying. It\u2019s more like this low hum in the background than a full-blown takeover. When it hits, motivation definitely takes a hit, but I still manage to keep up with the basics. I\u2019m not falling apart or anything, just frustrated that it drags me down more than it should.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that\u2014sounds like it's a steady drain, even if not overwhelming. How about your interest or pleasure in things you usually enjoy? Are you still finding some satisfaction in your usual activities, like your volunteer work at the library?\nPatient: Yeah, I still get some satisfaction from the volunteer work at the library, but it\u2019s nowhere near what it used to be. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to stay engaged, but the motivation wavers a lot. I have to push myself more than I\u2019d like just to keep up with it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve given up completely, but it\u2019s definitely been a struggle.\nDoctor: It sounds like your connection to the volunteering has taken a hit, even if you\u2019re still holding on to it. How has that drop in pleasure and drive changed over time, and what kind of impact is it having on your day-to-day mood and functioning?\nPatient: It\u2019s been a gradual decline\u2014little by little, the pleasure I used to get from volunteering has faded, and the drive to stay involved comes and goes. Some days I\u2019m able to push through, but other times it feels like a real effort just to show up. It\u2019s not always obvious on the surface, but that constant background frustration wears on me. It\u2019s this subtle weight dragging down my mood and making day-to-day functioning more of a chore than it should be.\nDoctor: That subtle but constant weight you describe can be really hard to carry day in and day out. Have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s important to talk about, and I want you to know you\u2019re in a safe space here.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t had any thoughts about death or suicide recently. Just so we\u2019re clear.\nDoctor: Thanks for being clear on that. Have you noticed any trouble concentrating or making decisions lately? Understanding this helps get a full picture of how things might be affecting your daily life.\nPatient: Yeah, trouble concentrating and making decisions comes up fairly often. It\u2019s enough to slow me down and makes it harder to get anything done without feeling annoyed at myself. It\u2019s not a crash-and-burn situation, but it definitely adds to the daily frustration and makes things more difficult than they should be.\nDoctor: Understood\u2014it sounds like these cognitive issues, while not overwhelming, still weigh on you and complicate daily tasks. How severe would you say these problems with focus and making choices are on most days?\nPatient: They\u2019re definitely a significant nuisance on most days\u2014enough to slow me down and wear on my patience\u2014but not so severe that I can\u2019t manage. It\u2019s frustrating to have to work harder to get through routine tasks, but it\u2019s something I handle, even if it drains me more than it should.\nDoctor: Got it\u2014these issues slow you down and test your patience but don\u2019t completely stop you. How often do you feel fatigued or low on energy, and how much does that affect your daily functioning?\nPatient: Fatigue hits me pretty often \u2014 enough to seriously drain my energy and endurance throughout the day. It\u2019s a real pain having to push through feeling worn out, and it definitely makes me more irritable than I\u2019d like. Keeping up with daily routines feels tougher, and it all just builds up on itself.\nDoctor: Sounds like that fatigue is a big factor wearing you down. How often during the day does this tiredness hit you, and what do you do to try and manage it along with the irritability?\nPatient: The tiredness hits me multiple times a day, draining whatever energy I have left. It feeds right into the irritability, so it\u2019s like a vicious cycle I can\u2019t shake. I try to push through \u2014 taking breaks, pacing myself \u2014 but those strategies only get me so far. At the end of the day, it still makes it harder to keep up with routines, even if I\u2019m managing just barely. It\u2019s frustrating, to say the least.\nDoctor: That ongoing cycle of fatigue and irritability sounds incredibly draining, Martin, especially when it\u2019s making everyday routines so hard to keep up with. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re frustrated. How else do you feel this has been affecting your overall well-being or the ways you cope day to day?\nPatient: The fatigue and irritability do more than just wear me out physically\u2014they mess with my head too. I find myself getting short-tempered more often, which just drives me into shutting down socially. That isolation only makes everything feel worse. The coping strategies I once relied on aren\u2019t working like they used to, and I\u2019m getting annoyed way quicker than before. It feels like I\u2019m barely holding onto any sense of normalcy or control, and that just piles on more stress and frustration every day.\nDoctor: That sounds really tough\u2014short temper and social withdrawal both feeding into the stress and frustration. Since good sleep plays a big role in this, tell me more about your sleep troubles: what\u2019s the nature of your insomnia or restlessness at night, how often does it happen, and how much does it impact you the next day?\nPatient: Falling asleep is a battle most nights\u2014my mind races no matter what I try, and it\u2019s like there\u2019s no off switch. Once I finally drift off, I don\u2019t stay asleep for long; I wake up multiple times because of restlessness that just won\u2019t quit. The next day? I\u2019m drained, irritable, and my patience is worn thin before I even step outside. That exhaustion makes me avoid people more, which feeds the whole cycle. I\u2019ve tried different ways to manage the sleep issues, but honestly, none of it\u2019s done much good. This cycle just keeps dragging me down harder every day.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Martin. You mentioned restlessness and difficulty staying asleep\u2014how often do you find yourself physically unable to sit still or feeling slowed down in your movements during the day? This can help me understand more about your psychomotor symptoms.\nPatient: The restlessness hits multiple times during the day\u2014I can\u2019t sit still for long without pacing or shifting constantly. It drives me crazy because it\u2019s impossible to just relax or focus. Slowed movements happen too, but nowhere near as often as the restlessness. Either way, it\u2019s frustrating and makes everything feel ten times harder to handle.\nDoctor: You\u2019re managing a lot, Martin\u2014constantly battling restlessness along with fatigue and irritability takes real effort, and it\u2019s clear it\u2019s wearing you down. I want you to know I hear you, and it\u2019s not easy facing all this day after day. We\u2019ll work on a plan to help ease some of this burden.\nPatient: I appreciate that you hear me, but honestly, it\u2019s frustrating to have been fighting this for so long with little to show for it. I\u2019m tired of constantly pushing myself just to keep going. I\u2019m cautiously hopeful that whatever plan we come up with might actually bring some relief, but after all this, I\u2019m not holding my breath. Still, I\u2019m willing to give it a shot.\nDoctor: I understand how exhausting and discouraging this has been for you, Martin. It takes a lot to keep pushing through, and I respect your perseverance and cautious hope. We\u2019ll work together to find an approach that truly makes a difference.\nPatient: It\u2019s been a long haul, and I\u2019m frustrated with how much energy it takes just to keep going without really getting better. I\u2019m willing to try whatever you suggest, but I\u2019m skeptical it\u2019ll bring the kind of change I need. It\u2019s hard to stay hopeful when this has dragged on so long, but I\u2019m not ready to give up yet. Let\u2019s see if this plan can actually make a difference.\nDoctor: I hear the weight of this long struggle and how much it\u2019s worn you down, Martin. It\u2019s completely normal to feel skeptical after all this time, but it takes real courage to keep going and not give up. We\u2019re in this together, and I\u2019m committed to helping you find real, meaningful improvements.\nPatient: I know this has been a tough road, and I\u2019m not expecting overnight changes or miracles. I\u2019m skeptical that things will improve much, but I\u2019m willing to keep at it and see where this treatment takes me.
