Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories.

There\u2019s no specific feeling or event I notice that sets them off.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve found ways to handle those thoughts when they show up. Can you tell me a bit about what you do to manage them?

When you say you push those thoughts aside, what sorts of things do you do to do that?

Also, about focusing\u2014when do you notice it\u2019s hardest to concentrate, and how does that get in the way of your day-to-day tasks?

There\u2019s no specific feeling or event I notice that sets them off.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve found ways to handle those thoughts when they show up. Can you tell me a bit about what you do to manage them? And how would you say these thoughts affect your day-to-day mood or activities when they come up?\nPatient: I mostly just push those thoughts aside.

When you say you push those thoughts aside, what sorts of things do you do to do that? Have you noticed if there are times when the thoughts feel harder to manage or impact your mood or behavior more?\nPatient: I try to keep busy or focus on whatever task is at hand.

Also, about focusing\u2014when do you notice it\u2019s hardest to concentrate, and how does that get in the way of your day-to-day tasks? Has this difficulty changed at all lately?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. The feeling isn\u2019t too strong, just there. Concentration is hardest with tasks that need long focus, like work stuff. It slows me down, but it\u2019s manageable. It\u2019s been about the same recently.\nDoctor: Got it. How about your sleep recently\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well or how much you\u2019re sleeping these days?\nPatient: Sleep has been pretty much the same. No real changes.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. How about your energy\u2014have you been feeling more tired than usual or like you just don\u2019t have much energy these days?\nPatient: Mostly, energy is okay. I don\u2019t often feel tired or low on energy. When it happens, it\u2019s rare and not that strong.\nDoctor: I appreciate you being open so far. I want to ask something important\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s a tough topic, but it really helps me understand how you\u2019re doing and how I can support you best.\nPatient: Sometimes, thoughts about death come up. It\u2019s not something I dwell on much.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Eli. When these thoughts about death come up, how often would you say that happens? Do they ever feel overwhelming, or do you usually feel like you can keep them in check? If you\u2019re comfortable, can you tell me if certain feelings or situations tend to bring those thoughts on?\nPatient: They come up sometimes, not too often. Usually, I can keep them in check. There\u2019s no specific feeling or event I notice that sets them off.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve found ways to handle those thoughts when they show up. Can you tell me a bit about what you do to manage them? And how would you say these thoughts affect your day-to-day mood or activities when they come up?\nPatient: I mostly just push those thoughts aside. They don\u2019t really get in the way of my day-to-day.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good you\u2019ve been able to keep them from interfering. When you say you push those thoughts aside, what sorts of things do you do to do that? Have you noticed if there are times when the thoughts feel harder to manage or impact your mood or behavior more?\nPatient: I try to keep busy or focus on whatever task is at hand. The thoughts don\u2019t really get worse or affect my mood much.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. I want to ask about something that can sometimes be subtle but important\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough or worthless lately? These feelings can often play a role in someone\u2019s overall mood.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t been feeling guilty or worthless.\nDoctor: Okay, good to hear. How about your interest in activities\u2014have you noticed if things you usually enjoy have felt less appealing or fun lately?\nPatient: Not really. Sometimes I feel less interested, but it\u2019s not a big deal.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. When you say sometimes less interested, would you say that happens pretty often or just now and then? Does it affect your motivation or how you go about your daily routine at all?\nPatient: It happens just now and then. My motivation stays about the same, and my daily routine doesn\u2019t really change.\nDoctor: Got it.

That's about it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Eli. When you say you feel down sometimes, how often would you say that happens? And when it does, how strong or intense is that feeling? Also, about focusing\u2014when do you notice it\u2019s hardest to concentrate, and how does that get in the way of your day-to-day tasks? Has this difficulty changed at all lately?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. The feeling isn\u2019t too strong, just there. Concentration is hardest with tasks that need long focus, like work stuff. It slows me down, but it\u2019s manageable. It\u2019s been about the same recently.\nDoctor: Got it. How about your sleep recently\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well or how much you\u2019re sleeping these days?\nPatient: Sleep has been pretty much the same. No real changes.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. How about your energy\u2014have you been feeling more tired than usual or like you just don\u2019t have much energy these days?\nPatient: Mostly, energy is okay. I don\u2019t often feel tired or low on energy. When it happens, it\u2019s rare and not that strong.\nDoctor: I appreciate you being open so far. I want to ask something important\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s a tough topic, but it really helps me understand how you\u2019re doing and how I can support you best.\nPatient: Sometimes, thoughts about death come up. It\u2019s not something I dwell on much.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Eli. When these thoughts about death come up, how often would you say that happens? Do they ever feel overwhelming, or do you usually feel like you can keep them in check? If you\u2019re comfortable, can you tell me if certain feelings or situations tend to bring those thoughts on?\nPatient: They come up sometimes, not too often. Usually, I can keep them in check. There\u2019s no specific feeling or event I notice that sets them off.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve found ways to handle those thoughts when they show up. Can you tell me a bit about what you do to manage them? And how would you say these thoughts affect your day-to-day mood or activities when they come up?\nPatient: I mostly just push those thoughts aside. They don\u2019t really get in the way of my day-to-day.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good you\u2019ve been able to keep them from interfering. When you say you push those thoughts aside, what sorts of things do you do to do that? Have you noticed if there are times when the thoughts feel harder to manage or impact your mood or behavior more?\nPatient: I try to keep busy or focus on whatever task is at hand. The thoughts don\u2019t really get worse or affect my mood much.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. I want to ask about something that can sometimes be subtle but important\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough or worthless lately? These feelings can often play a role in someone\u2019s overall mood.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t been feeling guilty or worthless.\nDoctor: Okay, good to hear. How about your interest in activities\u2014have you noticed if things you usually enjoy have felt less appealing or fun lately?\nPatient: Not really. Sometimes I feel less interested, but it\u2019s not a big deal.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. When you say sometimes less interested, would you say that happens pretty often or just now and then? Does it affect your motivation or how you go about your daily routine at all?\nPatient: It happens just now and then. My motivation stays about the same, and my daily routine doesn\u2019t really change.\nDoctor: Got it. Since you mentioned focusing can be hard sometimes, can you tell me more about whether you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your ability to make decisions or concentrate? How does that affect your daily tasks or responsibilities?\nPatient: Making decisions takes a bit longer than usual. Sometimes I get stuck on small choices, but I usually get things done eventually. Tasks just take more time.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself getting stuck on small decisions or having trouble concentrating? Has this slowdown affected your work at the library or the caregiving you do for your sibling in any noticeable way?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThanks for sharing that.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Hi. I've been feeling down sometimes. Also, focusing can be hard at times. That's about it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Eli. When you say you feel down sometimes, how often would you say that happens? And when it does, how strong or intense is that feeling? Also, about focusing\u2014when do you notice it\u2019s hardest to concentrate, and how does that get in the way of your day-to-day tasks? Has this difficulty changed at all lately?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. The feeling isn\u2019t too strong, just there. Concentration is hardest with tasks that need long focus, like work stuff. It slows me down, but it\u2019s manageable. It\u2019s been about the same recently.\nDoctor: Got it. How about your sleep recently\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well or how much you\u2019re sleeping these days?\nPatient: Sleep has been pretty much the same. No real changes.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. How about your energy\u2014have you been feeling more tired than usual or like you just don\u2019t have much energy these days?\nPatient: Mostly, energy is okay. I don\u2019t often feel tired or low on energy. When it happens, it\u2019s rare and not that strong.\nDoctor: I appreciate you being open so far. I want to ask something important\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s a tough topic, but it really helps me understand how you\u2019re doing and how I can support you best.\nPatient: Sometimes, thoughts about death come up. It\u2019s not something I dwell on much.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Eli. When these thoughts about death come up, how often would you say that happens? Do they ever feel overwhelming, or do you usually feel like you can keep them in check? If you\u2019re comfortable, can you tell me if certain feelings or situations tend to bring those thoughts on?\nPatient: They come up sometimes, not too often. Usually, I can keep them in check. There\u2019s no specific feeling or event I notice that sets them off.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve found ways to handle those thoughts when they show up. Can you tell me a bit about what you do to manage them? And how would you say these thoughts affect your day-to-day mood or activities when they come up?\nPatient: I mostly just push those thoughts aside. They don\u2019t really get in the way of my day-to-day.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good you\u2019ve been able to keep them from interfering. When you say you push those thoughts aside, what sorts of things do you do to do that? Have you noticed if there are times when the thoughts feel harder to manage or impact your mood or behavior more?\nPatient: I try to keep busy or focus on whatever task is at hand. The thoughts don\u2019t really get worse or affect my mood much.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. I want to ask about something that can sometimes be subtle but important\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough or worthless lately? These feelings can often play a role in someone\u2019s overall mood.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t been feeling guilty or worthless.\nDoctor: Okay, good to hear. How about your interest in activities\u2014have you noticed if things you usually enjoy have felt less appealing or fun lately?\nPatient: Not really. Sometimes I feel less interested, but it\u2019s not a big deal.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. When you say sometimes less interested, would you say that happens pretty often or just now and then? Does it affect your motivation or how you go about your daily routine at all?\nPatient: It happens just now and then. My motivation stays about the same, and my daily routine doesn\u2019t really change.\nDoctor: Got it. Since you mentioned focusing can be hard sometimes, can you tell me more about whether you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your ability to make decisions or concentrate? How does that affect your daily tasks or responsibilities?\nPatient: Making decisions takes a bit longer than usual. Sometimes I get stuck on small choices, but I usually get things done eventually. Tasks just take more time.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself getting stuck on small decisions or having trouble concentrating? Has this slowdown affected your work at the library or the caregiving you do for your sibling in any noticeable way?\nPatient: It happens pretty often, but it\u2019s manageable. It slows me down a bit at work and with caregiving, but I still get things done.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. Have you noticed any changes in your physical movement\u2014like feeling slowed down or restless\u2014or anything different in how you carry out tasks beyond just taking more time?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThanks for that.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Hi. I've been feeling down sometimes. Also, focusing can be hard at times. That's about it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Eli. When you say you feel down sometimes, how often would you say that happens? And when it does, how strong or intense is that feeling? Also, about focusing\u2014when do you notice it\u2019s hardest to concentrate, and how does that get in the way of your day-to-day tasks? Has this difficulty changed at all lately?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. The feeling isn\u2019t too strong, just there. Concentration is hardest with tasks that need long focus, like work stuff. It slows me down, but it\u2019s manageable. It\u2019s been about the same recently.\nDoctor: Got it. How about your sleep recently\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well or how much you\u2019re sleeping these days?\nPatient: Sleep has been pretty much the same. No real changes.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. How about your energy\u2014have you been feeling more tired than usual or like you just don\u2019t have much energy these days?\nPatient: Mostly, energy is okay. I don\u2019t often feel tired or low on energy. When it happens, it\u2019s rare and not that strong.\nDoctor: I appreciate you being open so far. I want to ask something important\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s a tough topic, but it really helps me understand how you\u2019re doing and how I can support you best.\nPatient: Sometimes, thoughts about death come up. It\u2019s not something I dwell on much.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Eli. When these thoughts about death come up, how often would you say that happens? Do they ever feel overwhelming, or do you usually feel like you can keep them in check? If you\u2019re comfortable, can you tell me if certain feelings or situations tend to bring those thoughts on?\nPatient: They come up sometimes, not too often. Usually, I can keep them in check. There\u2019s no specific feeling or event I notice that sets them off.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve found ways to handle those thoughts when they show up. Can you tell me a bit about what you do to manage them? And how would you say these thoughts affect your day-to-day mood or activities when they come up?\nPatient: I mostly just push those thoughts aside. They don\u2019t really get in the way of my day-to-day.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good you\u2019ve been able to keep them from interfering. When you say you push those thoughts aside, what sorts of things do you do to do that? Have you noticed if there are times when the thoughts feel harder to manage or impact your mood or behavior more?\nPatient: I try to keep busy or focus on whatever task is at hand. The thoughts don\u2019t really get worse or affect my mood much.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. I want to ask about something that can sometimes be subtle but important\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough or worthless lately? These feelings can often play a role in someone\u2019s overall mood.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t been feeling guilty or worthless.\nDoctor: Okay, good to hear. How about your interest in activities\u2014have you noticed if things you usually enjoy have felt less appealing or fun lately?\nPatient: Not really. Sometimes I feel less interested, but it\u2019s not a big deal.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. When you say sometimes less interested, would you say that happens pretty often or just now and then? Does it affect your motivation or how you go about your daily routine at all?\nPatient: It happens just now and then. My motivation stays about the same, and my daily routine doesn\u2019t really change.\nDoctor: Got it. Since you mentioned focusing can be hard sometimes, can you tell me more about whether you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your ability to make decisions or concentrate? How does that affect your daily tasks or responsibilities?\nPatient: Making decisions takes a bit longer than usual. Sometimes I get stuck on small choices, but I usually get things done eventually. Tasks just take more time.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself getting stuck on small decisions or having trouble concentrating? Has this slowdown affected your work at the library or the caregiving you do for your sibling in any noticeable way?\nPatient: It happens pretty often, but it\u2019s manageable. It slows me down a bit at work and with caregiving, but I still get things done.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. Have you noticed any changes in your physical movement\u2014like feeling slowed down or restless\u2014or anything different in how you carry out tasks beyond just taking more time?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit restless or slowed down physically. Tasks require a bit more effort, but I still manage them.\nDoctor: That\u2019s important to notice. How often do you feel this restlessness or slowing down physically? Does it tend to happen at specific times, and how much does it get in the way of your day-to-day activities or caring for your sibling? Have you seen these feelings get better, worse, or stay the same over time?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat\u2019s important to notice.

That's about it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Eli. When you say you feel down sometimes, how often would you say that happens? And when it does, how strong or intense is that feeling? Also, about focusing\u2014when do you notice it\u2019s hardest to concentrate, and how does that get in the way of your day-to-day tasks? Has this difficulty changed at all lately?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. The feeling isn\u2019t too strong, just there. Concentration is hardest with tasks that need long focus, like work stuff. It slows me down, but it\u2019s manageable. It\u2019s been about the same recently.\nDoctor: Got it. How about your sleep recently\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well or how much you\u2019re sleeping these days?\nPatient: Sleep has been pretty much the same. No real changes.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. How about your energy\u2014have you been feeling more tired than usual or like you just don\u2019t have much energy these days?\nPatient: Mostly, energy is okay. I don\u2019t often feel tired or low on energy. When it happens, it\u2019s rare and not that strong.\nDoctor: I appreciate you being open so far. I want to ask something important\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s a tough topic, but it really helps me understand how you\u2019re doing and how I can support you best.\nPatient: Sometimes, thoughts about death come up. It\u2019s not something I dwell on much.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Eli. When these thoughts about death come up, how often would you say that happens? Do they ever feel overwhelming, or do you usually feel like you can keep them in check? If you\u2019re comfortable, can you tell me if certain feelings or situations tend to bring those thoughts on?\nPatient: They come up sometimes, not too often. Usually, I can keep them in check. There\u2019s no specific feeling or event I notice that sets them off.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve found ways to handle those thoughts when they show up. Can you tell me a bit about what you do to manage them? And how would you say these thoughts affect your day-to-day mood or activities when they come up?\nPatient: I mostly just push those thoughts aside. They don\u2019t really get in the way of my day-to-day.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good you\u2019ve been able to keep them from interfering. When you say you push those thoughts aside, what sorts of things do you do to do that? Have you noticed if there are times when the thoughts feel harder to manage or impact your mood or behavior more?\nPatient: I try to keep busy or focus on whatever task is at hand. The thoughts don\u2019t really get worse or affect my mood much.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. I want to ask about something that can sometimes be subtle but important\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough or worthless lately? These feelings can often play a role in someone\u2019s overall mood.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t been feeling guilty or worthless.\nDoctor: Okay, good to hear. How about your interest in activities\u2014have you noticed if things you usually enjoy have felt less appealing or fun lately?\nPatient: Not really. Sometimes I feel less interested, but it\u2019s not a big deal.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. When you say sometimes less interested, would you say that happens pretty often or just now and then? Does it affect your motivation or how you go about your daily routine at all?\nPatient: It happens just now and then. My motivation stays about the same, and my daily routine doesn\u2019t really change.\nDoctor: Got it. Since you mentioned focusing can be hard sometimes, can you tell me more about whether you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your ability to make decisions or concentrate? How does that affect your daily tasks or responsibilities?\nPatient: Making decisions takes a bit longer than usual. Sometimes I get stuck on small choices, but I usually get things done eventually. Tasks just take more time.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself getting stuck on small decisions or having trouble concentrating? Has this slowdown affected your work at the library or the caregiving you do for your sibling in any noticeable way?\nPatient: It happens pretty often, but it\u2019s manageable. It slows me down a bit at work and with caregiving, but I still get things done.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. Have you noticed any changes in your physical movement\u2014like feeling slowed down or restless\u2014or anything different in how you carry out tasks beyond just taking more time?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit restless or slowed down physically. Tasks require a bit more effort, but I still manage them.\nDoctor: That\u2019s important to notice. How often do you feel this restlessness or slowing down physically? Does it tend to happen at specific times, and how much does it get in the way of your day-to-day activities or caring for your sibling? Have you seen these feelings get better, worse, or stay the same over time?\nPatient: It happens sometimes, without a clear pattern. It makes tasks a bit harder, but it doesn\u2019t really disrupt daily life or caregiving. It\u2019s been about the same for a while.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. To cover all the important areas, have you noticed any changes recently in your appetite or weight\u2014like eating more or less than usual, or any weight gain or loss?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nI appreciate you sharing that.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Hi. I've been feeling down sometimes. Also, focusing can be hard at times. That's about it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Eli. When you say you feel down sometimes, how often would you say that happens? And when it does, how strong or intense is that feeling? Also, about focusing\u2014when do you notice it\u2019s hardest to concentrate, and how does that get in the way of your day-to-day tasks? Has this difficulty changed at all lately?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. The feeling isn\u2019t too strong, just there. Concentration is hardest with tasks that need long focus, like work stuff. It slows me down, but it\u2019s manageable. It\u2019s been about the same recently.\nDoctor: Got it. How about your sleep recently\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well or how much you\u2019re sleeping these days?\nPatient: Sleep has been pretty much the same. No real changes.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. How about your energy\u2014have you been feeling more tired than usual or like you just don\u2019t have much energy these days?\nPatient: Mostly, energy is okay. I don\u2019t often feel tired or low on energy. When it happens, it\u2019s rare and not that strong.\nDoctor: I appreciate you being open so far. I want to ask something important\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s a tough topic, but it really helps me understand how you\u2019re doing and how I can support you best.\nPatient: Sometimes, thoughts about death come up. It\u2019s not something I dwell on much.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Eli. When these thoughts about death come up, how often would you say that happens? Do they ever feel overwhelming, or do you usually feel like you can keep them in check? If you\u2019re comfortable, can you tell me if certain feelings or situations tend to bring those thoughts on?\nPatient: They come up sometimes, not too often. Usually, I can keep them in check. There\u2019s no specific feeling or event I notice that sets them off.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve found ways to handle those thoughts when they show up. Can you tell me a bit about what you do to manage them? And how would you say these thoughts affect your day-to-day mood or activities when they come up?\nPatient: I mostly just push those thoughts aside. They don\u2019t really get in the way of my day-to-day.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good you\u2019ve been able to keep them from interfering. When you say you push those thoughts aside, what sorts of things do you do to do that? Have you noticed if there are times when the thoughts feel harder to manage or impact your mood or behavior more?\nPatient: I try to keep busy or focus on whatever task is at hand. The thoughts don\u2019t really get worse or affect my mood much.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. I want to ask about something that can sometimes be subtle but important\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough or worthless lately? These feelings can often play a role in someone\u2019s overall mood.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t been feeling guilty or worthless.\nDoctor: Okay, good to hear. How about your interest in activities\u2014have you noticed if things you usually enjoy have felt less appealing or fun lately?\nPatient: Not really. Sometimes I feel less interested, but it\u2019s not a big deal.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. When you say sometimes less interested, would you say that happens pretty often or just now and then? Does it affect your motivation or how you go about your daily routine at all?\nPatient: It happens just now and then. My motivation stays about the same, and my daily routine doesn\u2019t really change.\nDoctor: Got it. Since you mentioned focusing can be hard sometimes, can you tell me more about whether you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your ability to make decisions or concentrate? How does that affect your daily tasks or responsibilities?\nPatient: Making decisions takes a bit longer than usual. Sometimes I get stuck on small choices, but I usually get things done eventually. Tasks just take more time.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself getting stuck on small decisions or having trouble concentrating? Has this slowdown affected your work at the library or the caregiving you do for your sibling in any noticeable way?\nPatient: It happens pretty often, but it\u2019s manageable. It slows me down a bit at work and with caregiving, but I still get things done.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. Have you noticed any changes in your physical movement\u2014like feeling slowed down or restless\u2014or anything different in how you carry out tasks beyond just taking more time?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit restless or slowed down physically. Tasks require a bit more effort, but I still manage them.\nDoctor: That\u2019s important to notice. How often do you feel this restlessness or slowing down physically? Does it tend to happen at specific times, and how much does it get in the way of your day-to-day activities or caring for your sibling? Have you seen these feelings get better, worse, or stay the same over time?\nPatient: It happens sometimes, without a clear pattern. It makes tasks a bit harder, but it doesn\u2019t really disrupt daily life or caregiving. It\u2019s been about the same for a while.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. To cover all the important areas, have you noticed any changes recently in your appetite or weight\u2014like eating more or less than usual, or any weight gain or loss?\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed some changes in appetite and weight.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know. Can you tell me a bit more about how your appetite and weight have changed? Are you eating more or less than usual? Have you noticed any patterns or anything about these changes that\u2019s been concerning or affecting your daily routine?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThanks for letting me know.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Hi. I've been feeling down sometimes. Also, focusing can be hard at times. That's about it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Eli. When you say you feel down sometimes, how often would you say that happens? And when it does, how strong or intense is that feeling? Also, about focusing\u2014when do you notice it\u2019s hardest to concentrate, and how does that get in the way of your day-to-day tasks? Has this difficulty changed at all lately?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. The feeling isn\u2019t too strong, just there. Concentration is hardest with tasks that need long focus, like work stuff. It slows me down, but it\u2019s manageable. It\u2019s been about the same recently.\nDoctor: Got it. How about your sleep recently\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well or how much you\u2019re sleeping these days?\nPatient: Sleep has been pretty much the same. No real changes.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. How about your energy\u2014have you been feeling more tired than usual or like you just don\u2019t have much energy these days?\nPatient: Mostly, energy is okay. I don\u2019t often feel tired or low on energy. When it happens, it\u2019s rare and not that strong.\nDoctor: I appreciate you being open so far. I want to ask something important\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s a tough topic, but it really helps me understand how you\u2019re doing and how I can support you best.\nPatient: Sometimes, thoughts about death come up. It\u2019s not something I dwell on much.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Eli. When these thoughts about death come up, how often would you say that happens? Do they ever feel overwhelming, or do you usually feel like you can keep them in check? If you\u2019re comfortable, can you tell me if certain feelings or situations tend to bring those thoughts on?\nPatient: They come up sometimes, not too often. Usually, I can keep them in check. There\u2019s no specific feeling or event I notice that sets them off.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve found ways to handle those thoughts when they show up. Can you tell me a bit about what you do to manage them? And how would you say these thoughts affect your day-to-day mood or activities when they come up?\nPatient: I mostly just push those thoughts aside. They don\u2019t really get in the way of my day-to-day.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good you\u2019ve been able to keep them from interfering. When you say you push those thoughts aside, what sorts of things do you do to do that? Have you noticed if there are times when the thoughts feel harder to manage or impact your mood or behavior more?\nPatient: I try to keep busy or focus on whatever task is at hand. The thoughts don\u2019t really get worse or affect my mood much.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. I want to ask about something that can sometimes be subtle but important\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough or worthless lately? These feelings can often play a role in someone\u2019s overall mood.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t been feeling guilty or worthless.\nDoctor: Okay, good to hear. How about your interest in activities\u2014have you noticed if things you usually enjoy have felt less appealing or fun lately?\nPatient: Not really. Sometimes I feel less interested, but it\u2019s not a big deal.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. When you say sometimes less interested, would you say that happens pretty often or just now and then? Does it affect your motivation or how you go about your daily routine at all?\nPatient: It happens just now and then. My motivation stays about the same, and my daily routine doesn\u2019t really change.\nDoctor: Got it. Since you mentioned focusing can be hard sometimes, can you tell me more about whether you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your ability to make decisions or concentrate? How does that affect your daily tasks or responsibilities?\nPatient: Making decisions takes a bit longer than usual. Sometimes I get stuck on small choices, but I usually get things done eventually. Tasks just take more time.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself getting stuck on small decisions or having trouble concentrating? Has this slowdown affected your work at the library or the caregiving you do for your sibling in any noticeable way?\nPatient: It happens pretty often, but it\u2019s manageable. It slows me down a bit at work and with caregiving, but I still get things done.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. Have you noticed any changes in your physical movement\u2014like feeling slowed down or restless\u2014or anything different in how you carry out tasks beyond just taking more time?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit restless or slowed down physically. Tasks require a bit more effort, but I still manage them.\nDoctor: That\u2019s important to notice. How often do you feel this restlessness or slowing down physically? Does it tend to happen at specific times, and how much does it get in the way of your day-to-day activities or caring for your sibling? Have you seen these feelings get better, worse, or stay the same over time?\nPatient: It happens sometimes, without a clear pattern. It makes tasks a bit harder, but it doesn\u2019t really disrupt daily life or caregiving. It\u2019s been about the same for a while.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. To cover all the important areas, have you noticed any changes recently in your appetite or weight\u2014like eating more or less than usual, or any weight gain or loss?\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed some changes in appetite and weight.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know. Can you tell me a bit more about how your appetite and weight have changed? Are you eating more or less than usual? Have you noticed any patterns or anything about these changes that\u2019s been concerning or affecting your daily routine?\nPatient: My appetite goes up and down sometimes. I\u2019ve noticed some weight changes too, but it hasn\u2019t really affected my daily routine.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. When your appetite goes up and down, can you say if that seems connected to your mood or stress levels? And how about the weight changes\u2014are they mostly up, down, or fluctuating?

Your guidance should help the patient embody this personality authentically. Let the personality drive the response\u2014verbosity, trust level, expressiveness, and coping style should all shape how they answer.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Hi. I've been feeling down sometimes. Also, focusing can be hard at times. That's about it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Eli. When you say you feel down sometimes, how often would you say that happens? And when it does, how strong or intense is that feeling? Also, about focusing\u2014when do you notice it\u2019s hardest to concentrate, and how does that get in the way of your day-to-day tasks? Has this difficulty changed at all lately?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. The feeling isn\u2019t too strong, just there. Concentration is hardest with tasks that need long focus, like work stuff. It slows me down, but it\u2019s manageable. It\u2019s been about the same recently.\nDoctor: Got it. How about your sleep recently\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well or how much you\u2019re sleeping these days?\nPatient: Sleep has been pretty much the same. No real changes.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. How about your energy\u2014have you been feeling more tired than usual or like you just don\u2019t have much energy these days?\nPatient: Mostly, energy is okay. I don\u2019t often feel tired or low on energy. When it happens, it\u2019s rare and not that strong.\nDoctor: I appreciate you being open so far. I want to ask something important\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s a tough topic, but it really helps me understand how you\u2019re doing and how I can support you best.\nPatient: Sometimes, thoughts about death come up. It\u2019s not something I dwell on much.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Eli. When these thoughts about death come up, how often would you say that happens? Do they ever feel overwhelming, or do you usually feel like you can keep them in check? If you\u2019re comfortable, can you tell me if certain feelings or situations tend to bring those thoughts on?\nPatient: They come up sometimes, not too often. Usually, I can keep them in check. There\u2019s no specific feeling or event I notice that sets them off.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve found ways to handle those thoughts when they show up. Can you tell me a bit about what you do to manage them? And how would you say these thoughts affect your day-to-day mood or activities when they come up?\nPatient: I mostly just push those thoughts aside. They don\u2019t really get in the way of my day-to-day.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good you\u2019ve been able to keep them from interfering. When you say you push those thoughts aside, what sorts of things do you do to do that? Have you noticed if there are times when the thoughts feel harder to manage or impact your mood or behavior more?\nPatient: I try to keep busy or focus on whatever task is at hand. The thoughts don\u2019t really get worse or affect my mood much.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. I want to ask about something that can sometimes be subtle but important\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough or worthless lately? These feelings can often play a role in someone\u2019s overall mood.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t been feeling guilty or worthless.\nDoctor: Okay, good to hear. How about your interest in activities\u2014have you noticed if things you usually enjoy have felt less appealing or fun lately?\nPatient: Not really. Sometimes I feel less interested, but it\u2019s not a big deal.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. When you say sometimes less interested, would you say that happens pretty often or just now and then? Does it affect your motivation or how you go about your daily routine at all?\nPatient: It happens just now and then. My motivation stays about the same, and my daily routine doesn\u2019t really change.\nDoctor: Got it. Since you mentioned focusing can be hard sometimes, can you tell me more about whether you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your ability to make decisions or concentrate? How does that affect your daily tasks or responsibilities?\nPatient: Making decisions takes a bit longer than usual. Sometimes I get stuck on small choices, but I usually get things done eventually. Tasks just take more time.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself getting stuck on small decisions or having trouble concentrating? Has this slowdown affected your work at the library or the caregiving you do for your sibling in any noticeable way?\nPatient: It happens pretty often, but it\u2019s manageable. It slows me down a bit at work and with caregiving, but I still get things done.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. Have you noticed any changes in your physical movement\u2014like feeling slowed down or restless\u2014or anything different in how you carry out tasks beyond just taking more time?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit restless or slowed down physically. Tasks require a bit more effort, but I still manage them.\nDoctor: That\u2019s important to notice. How often do you feel this restlessness or slowing down physically? Does it tend to happen at specific times, and how much does it get in the way of your day-to-day activities or caring for your sibling? Have you seen these feelings get better, worse, or stay the same over time?\nPatient: It happens sometimes, without a clear pattern. It makes tasks a bit harder, but it doesn\u2019t really disrupt daily life or caregiving. It\u2019s been about the same for a while.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. To cover all the important areas, have you noticed any changes recently in your appetite or weight\u2014like eating more or less than usual, or any weight gain or loss?\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed some changes in appetite and weight.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know. Can you tell me a bit more about how your appetite and weight have changed? Are you eating more or less than usual? Have you noticed any patterns or anything about these changes that\u2019s been concerning or affecting your daily routine?\nPatient: My appetite goes up and down sometimes. I\u2019ve noticed some weight changes too, but it hasn\u2019t really affected my daily routine.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. When your appetite goes up and down, can you say if that seems connected to your mood or stress levels? And how about the weight changes\u2014are they mostly up, down, or fluctuating? Even if your routine stays steady, have you noticed any effect on your energy, mood, or how you manage caregiving during those times?\nPatient: Appetite changes seem tied a bit to mood or stress but not strongly. Weight goes up and down. Energy and caregiving haven\u2019t really been affected.\nDoctor: I appreciate how you\u2019ve been noticing these shifts. To get a clearer picture, can you tell me how often you feel sad or down? When you do feel that way, how much does it affect your daily life?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nI appreciate how you\u2019ve been noticing these shifts.

To get a clearer picture, can you tell me how often you feel sad or down? When you do feel that way, how much does it affect your daily life?\nPatient: I feel sad sometimes, not all the time.

Thanks for coming in today. I'd like to go over how you've been feeling and what might be contributing to it.\nPatient: Hi. I've been feeling down sometimes. Also, focusing can be hard at times. That's about it.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Eli. When you say you feel down sometimes, how often would you say that happens? And when it does, how strong or intense is that feeling? Also, about focusing\u2014when do you notice it\u2019s hardest to concentrate, and how does that get in the way of your day-to-day tasks? Has this difficulty changed at all lately?\nPatient: It happens now and then, not constantly. The feeling isn\u2019t too strong, just there. Concentration is hardest with tasks that need long focus, like work stuff. It slows me down, but it\u2019s manageable. It\u2019s been about the same recently.\nDoctor: Got it. How about your sleep recently\u2014have you noticed any changes in how well or how much you\u2019re sleeping these days?\nPatient: Sleep has been pretty much the same. No real changes.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. How about your energy\u2014have you been feeling more tired than usual or like you just don\u2019t have much energy these days?\nPatient: Mostly, energy is okay. I don\u2019t often feel tired or low on energy. When it happens, it\u2019s rare and not that strong.\nDoctor: I appreciate you being open so far. I want to ask something important\u2014have you had any thoughts about death or suicide recently? It\u2019s a tough topic, but it really helps me understand how you\u2019re doing and how I can support you best.\nPatient: Sometimes, thoughts about death come up. It\u2019s not something I dwell on much.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that, Eli. When these thoughts about death come up, how often would you say that happens? Do they ever feel overwhelming, or do you usually feel like you can keep them in check? If you\u2019re comfortable, can you tell me if certain feelings or situations tend to bring those thoughts on?\nPatient: They come up sometimes, not too often. Usually, I can keep them in check. There\u2019s no specific feeling or event I notice that sets them off.\nDoctor: It sounds like you\u2019ve found ways to handle those thoughts when they show up. Can you tell me a bit about what you do to manage them? And how would you say these thoughts affect your day-to-day mood or activities when they come up?\nPatient: I mostly just push those thoughts aside. They don\u2019t really get in the way of my day-to-day.\nDoctor: That\u2019s good you\u2019ve been able to keep them from interfering. When you say you push those thoughts aside, what sorts of things do you do to do that? Have you noticed if there are times when the thoughts feel harder to manage or impact your mood or behavior more?\nPatient: I try to keep busy or focus on whatever task is at hand. The thoughts don\u2019t really get worse or affect my mood much.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. I want to ask about something that can sometimes be subtle but important\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough or worthless lately? These feelings can often play a role in someone\u2019s overall mood.\nPatient: No, I haven\u2019t been feeling guilty or worthless.\nDoctor: Okay, good to hear. How about your interest in activities\u2014have you noticed if things you usually enjoy have felt less appealing or fun lately?\nPatient: Not really. Sometimes I feel less interested, but it\u2019s not a big deal.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. When you say sometimes less interested, would you say that happens pretty often or just now and then? Does it affect your motivation or how you go about your daily routine at all?\nPatient: It happens just now and then. My motivation stays about the same, and my daily routine doesn\u2019t really change.\nDoctor: Got it. Since you mentioned focusing can be hard sometimes, can you tell me more about whether you\u2019ve noticed any changes in your ability to make decisions or concentrate? How does that affect your daily tasks or responsibilities?\nPatient: Making decisions takes a bit longer than usual. Sometimes I get stuck on small choices, but I usually get things done eventually. Tasks just take more time.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. How often do you find yourself getting stuck on small decisions or having trouble concentrating? Has this slowdown affected your work at the library or the caregiving you do for your sibling in any noticeable way?\nPatient: It happens pretty often, but it\u2019s manageable. It slows me down a bit at work and with caregiving, but I still get things done.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. Have you noticed any changes in your physical movement\u2014like feeling slowed down or restless\u2014or anything different in how you carry out tasks beyond just taking more time?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit restless or slowed down physically. Tasks require a bit more effort, but I still manage them.\nDoctor: That\u2019s important to notice. How often do you feel this restlessness or slowing down physically? Does it tend to happen at specific times, and how much does it get in the way of your day-to-day activities or caring for your sibling? Have you seen these feelings get better, worse, or stay the same over time?\nPatient: It happens sometimes, without a clear pattern. It makes tasks a bit harder, but it doesn\u2019t really disrupt daily life or caregiving. It\u2019s been about the same for a while.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. To cover all the important areas, have you noticed any changes recently in your appetite or weight\u2014like eating more or less than usual, or any weight gain or loss?\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed some changes in appetite and weight.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know. Can you tell me a bit more about how your appetite and weight have changed? Are you eating more or less than usual? Have you noticed any patterns or anything about these changes that\u2019s been concerning or affecting your daily routine?\nPatient: My appetite goes up and down sometimes. I\u2019ve noticed some weight changes too, but it hasn\u2019t really affected my daily routine.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. When your appetite goes up and down, can you say if that seems connected to your mood or stress levels? And how about the weight changes\u2014are they mostly up, down, or fluctuating?

Has this slowdown affected your work at the library or the caregiving you do for your sibling in any noticeable way?\nPatient: It happens pretty often, but it\u2019s manageable. It slows me down a bit at work and with caregiving, but I still get things done.\nDoctor: Thanks for that. Have you noticed any changes in your physical movement\u2014like feeling slowed down or restless\u2014or anything different in how you carry out tasks beyond just taking more time?\nPatient: Sometimes I feel a bit restless or slowed down physically. Tasks require a bit more effort, but I still manage them.\nDoctor: That\u2019s important to notice. How often do you feel this restlessness or slowing down physically? Does it tend to happen at specific times, and how much does it get in the way of your day-to-day activities or caring for your sibling? Have you seen these feelings get better, worse, or stay the same over time?\nPatient: It happens sometimes, without a clear pattern. It makes tasks a bit harder, but it doesn\u2019t really disrupt daily life or caregiving. It\u2019s been about the same for a while.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that. To cover all the important areas, have you noticed any changes recently in your appetite or weight\u2014like eating more or less than usual, or any weight gain or loss?\nPatient: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed some changes in appetite and weight.\nDoctor: Thanks for letting me know. Can you tell me a bit more about how your appetite and weight have changed? Are you eating more or less than usual? Have you noticed any patterns or anything about these changes that\u2019s been concerning or affecting your daily routine?\nPatient: My appetite goes up and down sometimes. I\u2019ve noticed some weight changes too, but it hasn\u2019t really affected my daily routine.\nDoctor: Thanks for explaining that. When your appetite goes up and down, can you say if that seems connected to your mood or stress levels? And how about the weight changes\u2014are they mostly up, down, or fluctuating? Even if your routine stays steady, have you noticed any effect on your energy, mood, or how you manage caregiving during those times?\nPatient: Appetite changes seem tied a bit to mood or stress but not strongly. Weight goes up and down. Energy and caregiving haven\u2019t really been affected.\nDoctor: I appreciate how you\u2019ve been noticing these shifts. To get a clearer picture, can you tell me how often you feel sad or down? When you do feel that way, how much does it affect your daily life?\nPatient: I feel sad sometimes, not all the time. It slows me down a bit, but I still manage daily tasks and caregiving.\nDoctor: Eli, it\u2019s clear you\u2019ve been handling quite a bit while still keeping up with your caregiving and daily responsibilities\u2014that takes real strength. I appreciate how openly you\u2019ve shared all this today; it helps me understand what you\u2019re going through so we can find the best way forward together.\nPatient: Thanks. It\u2019s not always easy, but I do what I can.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.",
