Higher symptom severity should show up as more impact on daily life, relationships, or goals. Lower severity should feel milder.\n- Keep trauma and serious adversity realistic and not universal. Do not give every patient major trauma. Use stronger adversity only when it fits the context_domains and the symptom picture.\n- Keep each description concise. Avoid long stories. Each facet should be reusable as a small hook the patient might mention.\n- Use \"salience\" to show how central that facet is to the person's current life (low, med, high).\n\nAge-appropriate facets:\n- Teenagers (16-19): school pressures, friend drama, parental relationships, emerging identity, social media, early romantic relationships.\n- Young adults (20-34): career building, romantic partnerships, financial independence, identity formation, possibly early parenting.\n- Middle adults (35-54): career peaks/plateaus, parenting responsibilities, aging parents, marriage strain or stability, work-life balance.\n- Older adults (55-69): empty nest, pre-retirement concerns, health onset, grandchildren, legacy, relationship with adult children.\n- Seniors (70-80): retirement adjustment, health decline, loss of spouse/friends, isolation, mobility concerns, end-of-life reflection.\n\nFacet selection:\n- You must create one facet entry for each category in required_facets.\n- You may also add 2\u20135 extra facet entries using other ids from all_facets when this helps complete the picture of the person.\n- Do not add more than one extra trauma/adversity facet with salience \"high\".\n\nGeneral style:\n- Aim for a grounded, believable character whose life feels coherent when you read all fields together.\n- Vary what you create across different patients so that many different kinds of people appear in the dataset.\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

It makes perfect sense that feeling this drained would make everyday tasks feel overwhelming. You\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge how hard that is.\nPatient: Yeah, it really does weigh on me. Even simple tasks can feel tough sometimes. I just get frustrated with myself for not managing it better.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable to feel frustrated with yourself, but I wonder\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough lately, in a way that\u2019s been hard to shake?\nPatient: Yeah, I do feel guilty sometimes, like I\u2019m not doing enough.

Nothing too drastic.\nDoctor: When you say you feel worn out, can you tell me a bit more about that? How often does it happen, and what does it look like for you during those times? Is there anything that seems to bring it on more often?\nPatient: It\u2019s pretty regular, honestly. Most days, I just feel low on energy, like I\u2019m running on empty. Hard to say if anything specific sets it off, just seems to build up over time. Maybe I\u2019m not handling things well enough.\nDoctor: That sounds really exhausting, running on empty most days. How much does this tiredness affect what you can do during your day\u2014like work, caring for your parent, or even just taking care of yourself?\nPatient: It makes things harder, sure. I get by, but I probably should be managing better than I am. It\u2019s frustrating how much energy it takes just to keep up sometimes.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to keep going when every bit of energy feels stretched thin, and I want you to know that just managing as you are is no small thing.

I know I should be handling it better, but the tiredness just sticks around. Makes even simple things like keeping up with my parent or job searching feel like too much sometimes. I just... wish I had more energy, you know?\nDoctor: That constant tiredness, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much, would wear anyone down. It makes perfect sense that feeling this drained would make everyday tasks feel overwhelming. You\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge how hard that is.\nPatient: Yeah, it really does weigh on me. Even simple tasks can feel tough sometimes. I just get frustrated with myself for not managing it better.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable to feel frustrated with yourself, but I wonder\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough lately, in a way that\u2019s been hard to shake?\nPatient: Yeah, I do feel guilty sometimes, like I\u2019m not doing enough. It\u2019s hard to let it go\u2014it just lingers. Feels like I\u2019m the problem more than anything else.\nDoctor: Carrying that kind of guilt and self-blame can be really heavy, and it\u2019s painful to feel like you\u2019re the problem when you\u2019re doing so much. Those feelings don\u2019t reflect your true worth or all the effort you\u2019re putting in. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about how these thoughts show up for you day to day.\nPatient: They\u2019re constant, always there. I catch myself thinking I\u2019m not doing enough\u2014like I\u2019m just failing at everything. The thoughts don\u2019t really stop, even when I try to push them away.\nDoctor: It sounds really hard to have those thoughts lingering all the time.

Nothing too drastic.\nDoctor: When you say you feel worn out, can you tell me a bit more about that? How often does it happen, and what does it look like for you during those times? Is there anything that seems to bring it on more often?\nPatient: It\u2019s pretty regular, honestly. Most days, I just feel low on energy, like I\u2019m running on empty. Hard to say if anything specific sets it off, just seems to build up over time. Maybe I\u2019m not handling things well enough.\nDoctor: That sounds really exhausting, running on empty most days. How much does this tiredness affect what you can do during your day\u2014like work, caring for your parent, or even just taking care of yourself?\nPatient: It makes things harder, sure. I get by, but I probably should be managing better than I am. It\u2019s frustrating how much energy it takes just to keep up sometimes.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to keep going when every bit of energy feels stretched thin, and I want you to know that just managing as you are is no small thing. It\u2019s okay to feel frustrated with it all\u2014if you want to talk more about what that\u2019s been like for you, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s frustrating. I know I should be handling it better, but the tiredness just sticks around. Makes even simple things like keeping up with my parent or job searching feel like too much sometimes. I just... wish I had more energy, you know?\nDoctor: That constant tiredness, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much, would wear anyone down. It makes perfect sense that feeling this drained would make everyday tasks feel overwhelming. You\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge how hard that is.\nPatient: Yeah, it really does weigh on me. Even simple tasks can feel tough sometimes. I just get frustrated with myself for not managing it better.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable to feel frustrated with yourself, but I wonder\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough lately, in a way that\u2019s been hard to shake?\nPatient: Yeah, I do feel guilty sometimes, like I\u2019m not doing enough. It\u2019s hard to let it go\u2014it just lingers. Feels like I\u2019m the problem more than anything else.\nDoctor: Carrying that kind of guilt and self-blame can be really heavy, and it\u2019s painful to feel like you\u2019re the problem when you\u2019re doing so much. Those feelings don\u2019t reflect your true worth or all the effort you\u2019re putting in. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about how these thoughts show up for you day to day.\nPatient: They\u2019re constant, always there. I catch myself thinking I\u2019m not doing enough\u2014like I\u2019m just failing at everything. The thoughts don\u2019t really stop, even when I try to push them away.\nDoctor: It sounds really hard to have those thoughts lingering all the time. Have you also been feeling down, empty, or hopeless most days? How have those feelings been affecting your day-to-day life?\nPatient: Yeah, most days I\u2019m feeling pretty down. It just makes everything harder\u2014getting through the day, taking care of things. I keep blaming myself for not doing better, which only makes it worse.\nDoctor: That cycle of feeling down and blaming yourself sounds incredibly heavy, and it\u2019s completely understandable given the tough demands you\u2019re facing. You\u2019re doing a lot, even when it doesn\u2019t feel that way.

Hard to say if anything specific sets it off, just seems to build up over time. Maybe I\u2019m not handling things well enough.\nDoctor: That sounds really exhausting, running on empty most days. How much does this tiredness affect what you can do during your day\u2014like work, caring for your parent, or even just taking care of yourself?\nPatient: It makes things harder, sure. I get by, but I probably should be managing better than I am. It\u2019s frustrating how much energy it takes just to keep up sometimes.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to keep going when every bit of energy feels stretched thin, and I want you to know that just managing as you are is no small thing. It\u2019s okay to feel frustrated with it all\u2014if you want to talk more about what that\u2019s been like for you, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s frustrating. I know I should be handling it better, but the tiredness just sticks around. Makes even simple things like keeping up with my parent or job searching feel like too much sometimes. I just... wish I had more energy, you know?\nDoctor: That constant tiredness, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much, would wear anyone down. It makes perfect sense that feeling this drained would make everyday tasks feel overwhelming. You\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge how hard that is.\nPatient: Yeah, it really does weigh on me. Even simple tasks can feel tough sometimes. I just get frustrated with myself for not managing it better.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable to feel frustrated with yourself, but I wonder\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough lately, in a way that\u2019s been hard to shake?\nPatient: Yeah, I do feel guilty sometimes, like I\u2019m not doing enough. It\u2019s hard to let it go\u2014it just lingers. Feels like I\u2019m the problem more than anything else.\nDoctor: Carrying that kind of guilt and self-blame can be really heavy, and it\u2019s painful to feel like you\u2019re the problem when you\u2019re doing so much. Those feelings don\u2019t reflect your true worth or all the effort you\u2019re putting in. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about how these thoughts show up for you day to day.\nPatient: They\u2019re constant, always there. I catch myself thinking I\u2019m not doing enough\u2014like I\u2019m just failing at everything. The thoughts don\u2019t really stop, even when I try to push them away.\nDoctor: It sounds really hard to have those thoughts lingering all the time. Have you also been feeling down, empty, or hopeless most days? How have those feelings been affecting your day-to-day life?\nPatient: Yeah, most days I\u2019m feeling pretty down. It just makes everything harder\u2014getting through the day, taking care of things. I keep blaming myself for not doing better, which only makes it worse.\nDoctor: That cycle of feeling down and blaming yourself sounds incredibly heavy, and it\u2019s completely understandable given the tough demands you\u2019re facing. You\u2019re doing a lot, even when it doesn\u2019t feel that way. If you want to share more about how you\u2019re managing with all this, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I just try to push through, even when it feels like too much. If I don\u2019t keep going, it feels like I\u2019m just failing more. So yeah, I blame myself a lot. It\u2019s a constant struggle.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy weight to carry\u2014pushing through when it feels like too much, all while carrying that burden of blame.

I just get frustrated with myself for not managing it better.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable to feel frustrated with yourself, but I wonder\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough lately, in a way that\u2019s been hard to shake?\nPatient: Yeah, I do feel guilty sometimes, like I\u2019m not doing enough. It\u2019s hard to let it go\u2014it just lingers. Feels like I\u2019m the problem more than anything else.\nDoctor: Carrying that kind of guilt and self-blame can be really heavy, and it\u2019s painful to feel like you\u2019re the problem when you\u2019re doing so much. Those feelings don\u2019t reflect your true worth or all the effort you\u2019re putting in.

I catch myself thinking I\u2019m not doing enough\u2014like I\u2019m just failing at everything. The thoughts don\u2019t really stop, even when I try to push them away.\nDoctor: It sounds really hard to have those thoughts lingering all the time. Have you also been feeling down, empty, or hopeless most days? How have those feelings been affecting your day-to-day life?\nPatient: Yeah, most days I\u2019m feeling pretty down. It just makes everything harder\u2014getting through the day, taking care of things. I keep blaming myself for not doing better, which only makes it worse.\nDoctor: That cycle of feeling down and blaming yourself sounds incredibly heavy, and it\u2019s completely understandable given the tough demands you\u2019re facing. You\u2019re doing a lot, even when it doesn\u2019t feel that way. If you want to share more about how you\u2019re managing with all this, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I just try to push through, even when it feels like too much. If I don\u2019t keep going, it feels like I\u2019m just failing more. So yeah, I blame myself a lot. It\u2019s a constant struggle.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy weight to carry\u2014pushing through when it feels like too much, all while carrying that burden of blame. It takes a lot of strength to keep going like that. If there\u2019s anything else you want to share about how this struggle affects you, I\u2019m here to hear it.\nPatient: The self-blame makes it hard to focus sometimes. Between the fatigue and feeling empty, even small decisions feel overwhelming. It all just wears me down more.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue, feeling empty, and self-blame sounds really wearing, especially when it makes focusing or making decisions tough.

If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about how these thoughts show up for you day to day.\nPatient: They\u2019re constant, always there. I catch myself thinking I\u2019m not doing enough\u2014like I\u2019m just failing at everything. The thoughts don\u2019t really stop, even when I try to push them away.\nDoctor: It sounds really hard to have those thoughts lingering all the time. Have you also been feeling down, empty, or hopeless most days? How have those feelings been affecting your day-to-day life?\nPatient: Yeah, most days I\u2019m feeling pretty down. It just makes everything harder\u2014getting through the day, taking care of things. I keep blaming myself for not doing better, which only makes it worse.\nDoctor: That cycle of feeling down and blaming yourself sounds incredibly heavy, and it\u2019s completely understandable given the tough demands you\u2019re facing. You\u2019re doing a lot, even when it doesn\u2019t feel that way. If you want to share more about how you\u2019re managing with all this, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I just try to push through, even when it feels like too much. If I don\u2019t keep going, it feels like I\u2019m just failing more. So yeah, I blame myself a lot. It\u2019s a constant struggle.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy weight to carry\u2014pushing through when it feels like too much, all while carrying that burden of blame. It takes a lot of strength to keep going like that. If there\u2019s anything else you want to share about how this struggle affects you, I\u2019m here to hear it.\nPatient: The self-blame makes it hard to focus sometimes. Between the fatigue and feeling empty, even small decisions feel overwhelming. It all just wears me down more.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue, feeling empty, and self-blame sounds really wearing, especially when it makes focusing or making decisions tough. How often do you find yourself struggling with concentration or feeling mentally foggy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not all the time, maybe a day or two a week. But when it hits, it just makes everything feel heavier. The fatigue and guilt kind of feed into it. It adds to how overwhelmed I already am.\nDoctor: When those tougher days come, how much do the concentration troubles get in the way of your daily tasks?

If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about how these thoughts show up for you day to day.\nPatient: They\u2019re constant, always there. I catch myself thinking I\u2019m not doing enough\u2014like I\u2019m just failing at everything. The thoughts don\u2019t really stop, even when I try to push them away.\nDoctor: It sounds really hard to have those thoughts lingering all the time. Have you also been feeling down, empty, or hopeless most days? How have those feelings been affecting your day-to-day life?\nPatient: Yeah, most days I\u2019m feeling pretty down. It just makes everything harder\u2014getting through the day, taking care of things. I keep blaming myself for not doing better, which only makes it worse.\nDoctor: That cycle of feeling down and blaming yourself sounds incredibly heavy, and it\u2019s completely understandable given the tough demands you\u2019re facing. You\u2019re doing a lot, even when it doesn\u2019t feel that way. If you want to share more about how you\u2019re managing with all this, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I just try to push through, even when it feels like too much. If I don\u2019t keep going, it feels like I\u2019m just failing more. So yeah, I blame myself a lot. It\u2019s a constant struggle.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy weight to carry\u2014pushing through when it feels like too much, all while carrying that burden of blame. It takes a lot of strength to keep going like that. If there\u2019s anything else you want to share about how this struggle affects you, I\u2019m here to hear it.\nPatient: The self-blame makes it hard to focus sometimes. Between the fatigue and feeling empty, even small decisions feel overwhelming. It all just wears me down more.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue, feeling empty, and self-blame sounds really wearing, especially when it makes focusing or making decisions tough. How often do you find yourself struggling with concentration or feeling mentally foggy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not all the time, maybe a day or two a week. But when it hits, it just makes everything feel heavier. The fatigue and guilt kind of feed into it. It adds to how overwhelmed I already am.\nDoctor: When those tougher days come, how much do the concentration troubles get in the way of your daily tasks? Would you say they stop you from getting things done, or just slow you down?\nPatient: They mostly just slow me down. I can still get things done, but it takes longer and feels more exhausting. Fatigue and guilt just make it harder to focus, but I push through even when it\u2019s overwhelming.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds really tough to keep pushing through when things drag like that.

You\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge how hard that is.\nPatient: Yeah, it really does weigh on me. Even simple tasks can feel tough sometimes. I just get frustrated with myself for not managing it better.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable to feel frustrated with yourself, but I wonder\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough lately, in a way that\u2019s been hard to shake?\nPatient: Yeah, I do feel guilty sometimes, like I\u2019m not doing enough. It\u2019s hard to let it go\u2014it just lingers. Feels like I\u2019m the problem more than anything else.\nDoctor: Carrying that kind of guilt and self-blame can be really heavy, and it\u2019s painful to feel like you\u2019re the problem when you\u2019re doing so much. Those feelings don\u2019t reflect your true worth or all the effort you\u2019re putting in. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about how these thoughts show up for you day to day.\nPatient: They\u2019re constant, always there. I catch myself thinking I\u2019m not doing enough\u2014like I\u2019m just failing at everything. The thoughts don\u2019t really stop, even when I try to push them away.\nDoctor: It sounds really hard to have those thoughts lingering all the time. Have you also been feeling down, empty, or hopeless most days? How have those feelings been affecting your day-to-day life?\nPatient: Yeah, most days I\u2019m feeling pretty down. It just makes everything harder\u2014getting through the day, taking care of things. I keep blaming myself for not doing better, which only makes it worse.\nDoctor: That cycle of feeling down and blaming yourself sounds incredibly heavy, and it\u2019s completely understandable given the tough demands you\u2019re facing. You\u2019re doing a lot, even when it doesn\u2019t feel that way. If you want to share more about how you\u2019re managing with all this, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I just try to push through, even when it feels like too much. If I don\u2019t keep going, it feels like I\u2019m just failing more. So yeah, I blame myself a lot. It\u2019s a constant struggle.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy weight to carry\u2014pushing through when it feels like too much, all while carrying that burden of blame. It takes a lot of strength to keep going like that. If there\u2019s anything else you want to share about how this struggle affects you, I\u2019m here to hear it.\nPatient: The self-blame makes it hard to focus sometimes. Between the fatigue and feeling empty, even small decisions feel overwhelming. It all just wears me down more.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue, feeling empty, and self-blame sounds really wearing, especially when it makes focusing or making decisions tough. How often do you find yourself struggling with concentration or feeling mentally foggy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not all the time, maybe a day or two a week. But when it hits, it just makes everything feel heavier. The fatigue and guilt kind of feed into it. It adds to how overwhelmed I already am.\nDoctor: When those tougher days come, how much do the concentration troubles get in the way of your daily tasks? Would you say they stop you from getting things done, or just slow you down?\nPatient: They mostly just slow me down. I can still get things done, but it takes longer and feels more exhausting. Fatigue and guilt just make it harder to focus, but I push through even when it\u2019s overwhelming.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds really tough to keep pushing through when things drag like that. Have you noticed if you still find enjoyment in activities you used to like, or has that changed lately? It\u2019s really common to feel differently about things when you\u2019re overwhelmed like this.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed much change there. It\u2019s more about the tiredness and feeling like I\u2019m not doing enough.\nDoctor: Got it. Since tiredness is such a big part of what you\u2019re dealing with, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you\u2019d like?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nGot it.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, I guess. Just... a bit worn out sometimes. Nothing too drastic.\nDoctor: When you say you feel worn out, can you tell me a bit more about that? How often does it happen, and what does it look like for you during those times? Is there anything that seems to bring it on more often?\nPatient: It\u2019s pretty regular, honestly. Most days, I just feel low on energy, like I\u2019m running on empty. Hard to say if anything specific sets it off, just seems to build up over time. Maybe I\u2019m not handling things well enough.\nDoctor: That sounds really exhausting, running on empty most days. How much does this tiredness affect what you can do during your day\u2014like work, caring for your parent, or even just taking care of yourself?\nPatient: It makes things harder, sure. I get by, but I probably should be managing better than I am. It\u2019s frustrating how much energy it takes just to keep up sometimes.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to keep going when every bit of energy feels stretched thin, and I want you to know that just managing as you are is no small thing. It\u2019s okay to feel frustrated with it all\u2014if you want to talk more about what that\u2019s been like for you, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s frustrating. I know I should be handling it better, but the tiredness just sticks around. Makes even simple things like keeping up with my parent or job searching feel like too much sometimes. I just... wish I had more energy, you know?\nDoctor: That constant tiredness, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much, would wear anyone down. It makes perfect sense that feeling this drained would make everyday tasks feel overwhelming. You\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge how hard that is.\nPatient: Yeah, it really does weigh on me. Even simple tasks can feel tough sometimes. I just get frustrated with myself for not managing it better.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable to feel frustrated with yourself, but I wonder\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough lately, in a way that\u2019s been hard to shake?\nPatient: Yeah, I do feel guilty sometimes, like I\u2019m not doing enough. It\u2019s hard to let it go\u2014it just lingers. Feels like I\u2019m the problem more than anything else.\nDoctor: Carrying that kind of guilt and self-blame can be really heavy, and it\u2019s painful to feel like you\u2019re the problem when you\u2019re doing so much. Those feelings don\u2019t reflect your true worth or all the effort you\u2019re putting in. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about how these thoughts show up for you day to day.\nPatient: They\u2019re constant, always there. I catch myself thinking I\u2019m not doing enough\u2014like I\u2019m just failing at everything. The thoughts don\u2019t really stop, even when I try to push them away.\nDoctor: It sounds really hard to have those thoughts lingering all the time. Have you also been feeling down, empty, or hopeless most days? How have those feelings been affecting your day-to-day life?\nPatient: Yeah, most days I\u2019m feeling pretty down. It just makes everything harder\u2014getting through the day, taking care of things. I keep blaming myself for not doing better, which only makes it worse.\nDoctor: That cycle of feeling down and blaming yourself sounds incredibly heavy, and it\u2019s completely understandable given the tough demands you\u2019re facing. You\u2019re doing a lot, even when it doesn\u2019t feel that way. If you want to share more about how you\u2019re managing with all this, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I just try to push through, even when it feels like too much. If I don\u2019t keep going, it feels like I\u2019m just failing more. So yeah, I blame myself a lot. It\u2019s a constant struggle.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy weight to carry\u2014pushing through when it feels like too much, all while carrying that burden of blame. It takes a lot of strength to keep going like that. If there\u2019s anything else you want to share about how this struggle affects you, I\u2019m here to hear it.\nPatient: The self-blame makes it hard to focus sometimes. Between the fatigue and feeling empty, even small decisions feel overwhelming. It all just wears me down more.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue, feeling empty, and self-blame sounds really wearing, especially when it makes focusing or making decisions tough. How often do you find yourself struggling with concentration or feeling mentally foggy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not all the time, maybe a day or two a week. But when it hits, it just makes everything feel heavier. The fatigue and guilt kind of feed into it. It adds to how overwhelmed I already am.\nDoctor: When those tougher days come, how much do the concentration troubles get in the way of your daily tasks? Would you say they stop you from getting things done, or just slow you down?\nPatient: They mostly just slow me down. I can still get things done, but it takes longer and feels more exhausting. Fatigue and guilt just make it harder to focus, but I push through even when it\u2019s overwhelming.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds really tough to keep pushing through when things drag like that. Have you noticed if you still find enjoyment in activities you used to like, or has that changed lately? It\u2019s really common to feel differently about things when you\u2019re overwhelmed like this.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed much change there. It\u2019s more about the tiredness and feeling like I\u2019m not doing enough.\nDoctor: Got it. Since tiredness is such a big part of what you\u2019re dealing with, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you\u2019d like?\nPatient: I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up earlier than I want. It adds to the tiredness, but I probably should be handling it better.\nDoctor: When you have trouble falling asleep, how long does it usually take you to drift off?

Nothing too drastic.\nDoctor: When you say you feel worn out, can you tell me a bit more about that? How often does it happen, and what does it look like for you during those times? Is there anything that seems to bring it on more often?\nPatient: It\u2019s pretty regular, honestly. Most days, I just feel low on energy, like I\u2019m running on empty. Hard to say if anything specific sets it off, just seems to build up over time. Maybe I\u2019m not handling things well enough.\nDoctor: That sounds really exhausting, running on empty most days. How much does this tiredness affect what you can do during your day\u2014like work, caring for your parent, or even just taking care of yourself?\nPatient: It makes things harder, sure. I get by, but I probably should be managing better than I am. It\u2019s frustrating how much energy it takes just to keep up sometimes.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to keep going when every bit of energy feels stretched thin, and I want you to know that just managing as you are is no small thing. It\u2019s okay to feel frustrated with it all\u2014if you want to talk more about what that\u2019s been like for you, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s frustrating. I know I should be handling it better, but the tiredness just sticks around. Makes even simple things like keeping up with my parent or job searching feel like too much sometimes. I just... wish I had more energy, you know?\nDoctor: That constant tiredness, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much, would wear anyone down. It makes perfect sense that feeling this drained would make everyday tasks feel overwhelming. You\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge how hard that is.\nPatient: Yeah, it really does weigh on me. Even simple tasks can feel tough sometimes. I just get frustrated with myself for not managing it better.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable to feel frustrated with yourself, but I wonder\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough lately, in a way that\u2019s been hard to shake?\nPatient: Yeah, I do feel guilty sometimes, like I\u2019m not doing enough. It\u2019s hard to let it go\u2014it just lingers. Feels like I\u2019m the problem more than anything else.\nDoctor: Carrying that kind of guilt and self-blame can be really heavy, and it\u2019s painful to feel like you\u2019re the problem when you\u2019re doing so much. Those feelings don\u2019t reflect your true worth or all the effort you\u2019re putting in. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about how these thoughts show up for you day to day.\nPatient: They\u2019re constant, always there. I catch myself thinking I\u2019m not doing enough\u2014like I\u2019m just failing at everything. The thoughts don\u2019t really stop, even when I try to push them away.\nDoctor: It sounds really hard to have those thoughts lingering all the time. Have you also been feeling down, empty, or hopeless most days? How have those feelings been affecting your day-to-day life?\nPatient: Yeah, most days I\u2019m feeling pretty down. It just makes everything harder\u2014getting through the day, taking care of things. I keep blaming myself for not doing better, which only makes it worse.\nDoctor: That cycle of feeling down and blaming yourself sounds incredibly heavy, and it\u2019s completely understandable given the tough demands you\u2019re facing. You\u2019re doing a lot, even when it doesn\u2019t feel that way. If you want to share more about how you\u2019re managing with all this, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I just try to push through, even when it feels like too much. If I don\u2019t keep going, it feels like I\u2019m just failing more. So yeah, I blame myself a lot. It\u2019s a constant struggle.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy weight to carry\u2014pushing through when it feels like too much, all while carrying that burden of blame. It takes a lot of strength to keep going like that. If there\u2019s anything else you want to share about how this struggle affects you, I\u2019m here to hear it.\nPatient: The self-blame makes it hard to focus sometimes. Between the fatigue and feeling empty, even small decisions feel overwhelming. It all just wears me down more.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue, feeling empty, and self-blame sounds really wearing, especially when it makes focusing or making decisions tough. How often do you find yourself struggling with concentration or feeling mentally foggy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not all the time, maybe a day or two a week. But when it hits, it just makes everything feel heavier. The fatigue and guilt kind of feed into it. It adds to how overwhelmed I already am.\nDoctor: When those tougher days come, how much do the concentration troubles get in the way of your daily tasks? Would you say they stop you from getting things done, or just slow you down?\nPatient: They mostly just slow me down. I can still get things done, but it takes longer and feels more exhausting. Fatigue and guilt just make it harder to focus, but I push through even when it\u2019s overwhelming.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds really tough to keep pushing through when things drag like that. Have you noticed if you still find enjoyment in activities you used to like, or has that changed lately? It\u2019s really common to feel differently about things when you\u2019re overwhelmed like this.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed much change there. It\u2019s more about the tiredness and feeling like I\u2019m not doing enough.\nDoctor: Got it. Since tiredness is such a big part of what you\u2019re dealing with, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you\u2019d like?\nPatient: I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up earlier than I want. It adds to the tiredness, but I probably should be handling it better.\nDoctor: When you have trouble falling asleep, how long does it usually take you to drift off? And those early mornings\u2014how often do they happen? Do you feel rested at all when you wake up? It sounds like this disrupted sleep really adds to the tiredness you\u2019re already carrying.\nPatient: It usually takes a long time to fall asleep, and the early waking happens several times a week. I rarely feel rested when I wake up, which just adds to the tiredness I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That rough sleep sounds exhausting, especially when it\u2019s happening several times a week. How much does that tiredness from not sleeping well make your frustration or self-blame worse during the day? Is it something you notice almost every day, or more on certain days?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat rough sleep sounds exhausting, especially when it\u2019s happening several times a week.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, I guess. Just... a bit worn out sometimes. Nothing too drastic.\nDoctor: When you say you feel worn out, can you tell me a bit more about that? How often does it happen, and what does it look like for you during those times? Is there anything that seems to bring it on more often?\nPatient: It\u2019s pretty regular, honestly. Most days, I just feel low on energy, like I\u2019m running on empty. Hard to say if anything specific sets it off, just seems to build up over time. Maybe I\u2019m not handling things well enough.\nDoctor: That sounds really exhausting, running on empty most days. How much does this tiredness affect what you can do during your day\u2014like work, caring for your parent, or even just taking care of yourself?\nPatient: It makes things harder, sure. I get by, but I probably should be managing better than I am. It\u2019s frustrating how much energy it takes just to keep up sometimes.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to keep going when every bit of energy feels stretched thin, and I want you to know that just managing as you are is no small thing. It\u2019s okay to feel frustrated with it all\u2014if you want to talk more about what that\u2019s been like for you, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s frustrating. I know I should be handling it better, but the tiredness just sticks around. Makes even simple things like keeping up with my parent or job searching feel like too much sometimes. I just... wish I had more energy, you know?\nDoctor: That constant tiredness, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much, would wear anyone down. It makes perfect sense that feeling this drained would make everyday tasks feel overwhelming. You\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge how hard that is.\nPatient: Yeah, it really does weigh on me. Even simple tasks can feel tough sometimes. I just get frustrated with myself for not managing it better.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable to feel frustrated with yourself, but I wonder\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough lately, in a way that\u2019s been hard to shake?\nPatient: Yeah, I do feel guilty sometimes, like I\u2019m not doing enough. It\u2019s hard to let it go\u2014it just lingers. Feels like I\u2019m the problem more than anything else.\nDoctor: Carrying that kind of guilt and self-blame can be really heavy, and it\u2019s painful to feel like you\u2019re the problem when you\u2019re doing so much. Those feelings don\u2019t reflect your true worth or all the effort you\u2019re putting in. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about how these thoughts show up for you day to day.\nPatient: They\u2019re constant, always there. I catch myself thinking I\u2019m not doing enough\u2014like I\u2019m just failing at everything. The thoughts don\u2019t really stop, even when I try to push them away.\nDoctor: It sounds really hard to have those thoughts lingering all the time. Have you also been feeling down, empty, or hopeless most days? How have those feelings been affecting your day-to-day life?\nPatient: Yeah, most days I\u2019m feeling pretty down. It just makes everything harder\u2014getting through the day, taking care of things. I keep blaming myself for not doing better, which only makes it worse.\nDoctor: That cycle of feeling down and blaming yourself sounds incredibly heavy, and it\u2019s completely understandable given the tough demands you\u2019re facing. You\u2019re doing a lot, even when it doesn\u2019t feel that way. If you want to share more about how you\u2019re managing with all this, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I just try to push through, even when it feels like too much. If I don\u2019t keep going, it feels like I\u2019m just failing more. So yeah, I blame myself a lot. It\u2019s a constant struggle.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy weight to carry\u2014pushing through when it feels like too much, all while carrying that burden of blame. It takes a lot of strength to keep going like that. If there\u2019s anything else you want to share about how this struggle affects you, I\u2019m here to hear it.\nPatient: The self-blame makes it hard to focus sometimes. Between the fatigue and feeling empty, even small decisions feel overwhelming. It all just wears me down more.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue, feeling empty, and self-blame sounds really wearing, especially when it makes focusing or making decisions tough. How often do you find yourself struggling with concentration or feeling mentally foggy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not all the time, maybe a day or two a week. But when it hits, it just makes everything feel heavier. The fatigue and guilt kind of feed into it. It adds to how overwhelmed I already am.\nDoctor: When those tougher days come, how much do the concentration troubles get in the way of your daily tasks? Would you say they stop you from getting things done, or just slow you down?\nPatient: They mostly just slow me down. I can still get things done, but it takes longer and feels more exhausting. Fatigue and guilt just make it harder to focus, but I push through even when it\u2019s overwhelming.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds really tough to keep pushing through when things drag like that. Have you noticed if you still find enjoyment in activities you used to like, or has that changed lately? It\u2019s really common to feel differently about things when you\u2019re overwhelmed like this.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed much change there. It\u2019s more about the tiredness and feeling like I\u2019m not doing enough.\nDoctor: Got it. Since tiredness is such a big part of what you\u2019re dealing with, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you\u2019d like?\nPatient: I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up earlier than I want. It adds to the tiredness, but I probably should be handling it better.\nDoctor: When you have trouble falling asleep, how long does it usually take you to drift off? And those early mornings\u2014how often do they happen? Do you feel rested at all when you wake up? It sounds like this disrupted sleep really adds to the tiredness you\u2019re already carrying.\nPatient: It usually takes a long time to fall asleep, and the early waking happens several times a week. I rarely feel rested when I wake up, which just adds to the tiredness I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That rough sleep sounds exhausting, especially when it\u2019s happening several times a week. How much does that tiredness from not sleeping well make your frustration or self-blame worse during the day? Is it something you notice almost every day, or more on certain days?\nPatient: The tiredness definitely makes the frustration worse, and I catch myself blaming myself more when I don\u2019t sleep well. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens pretty often.\nDoctor: That cycle of tiredness fueling frustration and self-blame sounds really draining. On those tougher days when this hits hardest, how do you notice it impacting your mood or what you\u2019re able to get done? What do you try to do to cope when it feels overwhelming?\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThat cycle of tiredness fueling frustration and self-blame sounds really draining.

It\u2019s a constant struggle.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy weight to carry\u2014pushing through when it feels like too much, all while carrying that burden of blame. It takes a lot of strength to keep going like that. If there\u2019s anything else you want to share about how this struggle affects you, I\u2019m here to hear it.\nPatient: The self-blame makes it hard to focus sometimes. Between the fatigue and feeling empty, even small decisions feel overwhelming. It all just wears me down more.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue, feeling empty, and self-blame sounds really wearing, especially when it makes focusing or making decisions tough. How often do you find yourself struggling with concentration or feeling mentally foggy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not all the time, maybe a day or two a week. But when it hits, it just makes everything feel heavier. The fatigue and guilt kind of feed into it. It adds to how overwhelmed I already am.\nDoctor: When those tougher days come, how much do the concentration troubles get in the way of your daily tasks? Would you say they stop you from getting things done, or just slow you down?\nPatient: They mostly just slow me down. I can still get things done, but it takes longer and feels more exhausting. Fatigue and guilt just make it harder to focus, but I push through even when it\u2019s overwhelming.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds really tough to keep pushing through when things drag like that. Have you noticed if you still find enjoyment in activities you used to like, or has that changed lately? It\u2019s really common to feel differently about things when you\u2019re overwhelmed like this.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed much change there. It\u2019s more about the tiredness and feeling like I\u2019m not doing enough.\nDoctor: Got it. Since tiredness is such a big part of what you\u2019re dealing with, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you\u2019d like?\nPatient: I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up earlier than I want. It adds to the tiredness, but I probably should be handling it better.\nDoctor: When you have trouble falling asleep, how long does it usually take you to drift off? And those early mornings\u2014how often do they happen? Do you feel rested at all when you wake up? It sounds like this disrupted sleep really adds to the tiredness you\u2019re already carrying.\nPatient: It usually takes a long time to fall asleep, and the early waking happens several times a week. I rarely feel rested when I wake up, which just adds to the tiredness I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That rough sleep sounds exhausting, especially when it\u2019s happening several times a week. How much does that tiredness from not sleeping well make your frustration or self-blame worse during the day? Is it something you notice almost every day, or more on certain days?\nPatient: The tiredness definitely makes the frustration worse, and I catch myself blaming myself more when I don\u2019t sleep well. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens pretty often.\nDoctor: That cycle of tiredness fueling frustration and self-blame sounds really draining. On those tougher days when this hits hardest, how do you notice it impacting your mood or what you\u2019re able to get done? What do you try to do to cope when it feels overwhelming?\nPatient: On my bad days, my mood definitely worsens and I can\u2019t get as much done. Still, I push myself to keep going, even if it\u2019s overwhelming. The frustration and self-blame just pile on more when I\u2019m that tired.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nOn my bad days, my mood definitely worsens and I can\u2019t get as much done.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, I guess. Just... a bit worn out sometimes. Nothing too drastic.\nDoctor: When you say you feel worn out, can you tell me a bit more about that? How often does it happen, and what does it look like for you during those times? Is there anything that seems to bring it on more often?\nPatient: It\u2019s pretty regular, honestly. Most days, I just feel low on energy, like I\u2019m running on empty. Hard to say if anything specific sets it off, just seems to build up over time. Maybe I\u2019m not handling things well enough.\nDoctor: That sounds really exhausting, running on empty most days. How much does this tiredness affect what you can do during your day\u2014like work, caring for your parent, or even just taking care of yourself?\nPatient: It makes things harder, sure. I get by, but I probably should be managing better than I am. It\u2019s frustrating how much energy it takes just to keep up sometimes.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to keep going when every bit of energy feels stretched thin, and I want you to know that just managing as you are is no small thing. It\u2019s okay to feel frustrated with it all\u2014if you want to talk more about what that\u2019s been like for you, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s frustrating. I know I should be handling it better, but the tiredness just sticks around. Makes even simple things like keeping up with my parent or job searching feel like too much sometimes. I just... wish I had more energy, you know?\nDoctor: That constant tiredness, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much, would wear anyone down. It makes perfect sense that feeling this drained would make everyday tasks feel overwhelming. You\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge how hard that is.\nPatient: Yeah, it really does weigh on me. Even simple tasks can feel tough sometimes. I just get frustrated with myself for not managing it better.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable to feel frustrated with yourself, but I wonder\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough lately, in a way that\u2019s been hard to shake?\nPatient: Yeah, I do feel guilty sometimes, like I\u2019m not doing enough. It\u2019s hard to let it go\u2014it just lingers. Feels like I\u2019m the problem more than anything else.\nDoctor: Carrying that kind of guilt and self-blame can be really heavy, and it\u2019s painful to feel like you\u2019re the problem when you\u2019re doing so much. Those feelings don\u2019t reflect your true worth or all the effort you\u2019re putting in. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about how these thoughts show up for you day to day.\nPatient: They\u2019re constant, always there. I catch myself thinking I\u2019m not doing enough\u2014like I\u2019m just failing at everything. The thoughts don\u2019t really stop, even when I try to push them away.\nDoctor: It sounds really hard to have those thoughts lingering all the time. Have you also been feeling down, empty, or hopeless most days? How have those feelings been affecting your day-to-day life?\nPatient: Yeah, most days I\u2019m feeling pretty down. It just makes everything harder\u2014getting through the day, taking care of things. I keep blaming myself for not doing better, which only makes it worse.\nDoctor: That cycle of feeling down and blaming yourself sounds incredibly heavy, and it\u2019s completely understandable given the tough demands you\u2019re facing. You\u2019re doing a lot, even when it doesn\u2019t feel that way. If you want to share more about how you\u2019re managing with all this, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I just try to push through, even when it feels like too much. If I don\u2019t keep going, it feels like I\u2019m just failing more. So yeah, I blame myself a lot.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, I guess. Just... a bit worn out sometimes. Nothing too drastic.\nDoctor: When you say you feel worn out, can you tell me a bit more about that? How often does it happen, and what does it look like for you during those times? Is there anything that seems to bring it on more often?\nPatient: It\u2019s pretty regular, honestly. Most days, I just feel low on energy, like I\u2019m running on empty. Hard to say if anything specific sets it off, just seems to build up over time. Maybe I\u2019m not handling things well enough.\nDoctor: That sounds really exhausting, running on empty most days. How much does this tiredness affect what you can do during your day\u2014like work, caring for your parent, or even just taking care of yourself?\nPatient: It makes things harder, sure. I get by, but I probably should be managing better than I am. It\u2019s frustrating how much energy it takes just to keep up sometimes.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to keep going when every bit of energy feels stretched thin, and I want you to know that just managing as you are is no small thing. It\u2019s okay to feel frustrated with it all\u2014if you want to talk more about what that\u2019s been like for you, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s frustrating. I know I should be handling it better, but the tiredness just sticks around. Makes even simple things like keeping up with my parent or job searching feel like too much sometimes. I just... wish I had more energy, you know?\nDoctor: That constant tiredness, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much, would wear anyone down. It makes perfect sense that feeling this drained would make everyday tasks feel overwhelming. You\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge how hard that is.\nPatient: Yeah, it really does weigh on me. Even simple tasks can feel tough sometimes. I just get frustrated with myself for not managing it better.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable to feel frustrated with yourself, but I wonder\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough lately, in a way that\u2019s been hard to shake?\nPatient: Yeah, I do feel guilty sometimes, like I\u2019m not doing enough. It\u2019s hard to let it go\u2014it just lingers. Feels like I\u2019m the problem more than anything else.\nDoctor: Carrying that kind of guilt and self-blame can be really heavy, and it\u2019s painful to feel like you\u2019re the problem when you\u2019re doing so much. Those feelings don\u2019t reflect your true worth or all the effort you\u2019re putting in. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about how these thoughts show up for you day to day.\nPatient: They\u2019re constant, always there. I catch myself thinking I\u2019m not doing enough\u2014like I\u2019m just failing at everything. The thoughts don\u2019t really stop, even when I try to push them away.\nDoctor: It sounds really hard to have those thoughts lingering all the time. Have you also been feeling down, empty, or hopeless most days? How have those feelings been affecting your day-to-day life?\nPatient: Yeah, most days I\u2019m feeling pretty down. It just makes everything harder\u2014getting through the day, taking care of things. I keep blaming myself for not doing better, which only makes it worse.\nDoctor: That cycle of feeling down and blaming yourself sounds incredibly heavy, and it\u2019s completely understandable given the tough demands you\u2019re facing. You\u2019re doing a lot, even when it doesn\u2019t feel that way. If you want to share more about how you\u2019re managing with all this, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I just try to push through, even when it feels like too much. If I don\u2019t keep going, it feels like I\u2019m just failing more. So yeah, I blame myself a lot. It\u2019s a constant struggle.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy weight to carry\u2014pushing through when it feels like too much, all while carrying that burden of blame. It takes a lot of strength to keep going like that. If there\u2019s anything else you want to share about how this struggle affects you, I\u2019m here to hear it.\nPatient: The self-blame makes it hard to focus sometimes. Between the fatigue and feeling empty, even small decisions feel overwhelming. It all just wears me down more.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue, feeling empty, and self-blame sounds really wearing, especially when it makes focusing or making decisions tough. How often do you find yourself struggling with concentration or feeling mentally foggy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not all the time, maybe a day or two a week. But when it hits, it just makes everything feel heavier. The fatigue and guilt kind of feed into it. It adds to how overwhelmed I already am.\nDoctor: When those tougher days come, how much do the concentration troubles get in the way of your daily tasks? Would you say they stop you from getting things done, or just slow you down?\nPatient: They mostly just slow me down. I can still get things done, but it takes longer and feels more exhausting. Fatigue and guilt just make it harder to focus, but I push through even when it\u2019s overwhelming.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds really tough to keep pushing through when things drag like that. Have you noticed if you still find enjoyment in activities you used to like, or has that changed lately? It\u2019s really common to feel differently about things when you\u2019re overwhelmed like this.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed much change there. It\u2019s more about the tiredness and feeling like I\u2019m not doing enough.\nDoctor: Got it. Since tiredness is such a big part of what you\u2019re dealing with, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you\u2019d like?\nPatient: I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up earlier than I want. It adds to the tiredness, but I probably should be handling it better.\nDoctor: When you have trouble falling asleep, how long does it usually take you to drift off? And those early mornings\u2014how often do they happen? Do you feel rested at all when you wake up? It sounds like this disrupted sleep really adds to the tiredness you\u2019re already carrying.\nPatient: It usually takes a long time to fall asleep, and the early waking happens several times a week. I rarely feel rested when I wake up, which just adds to the tiredness I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That rough sleep sounds exhausting, especially when it\u2019s happening several times a week. How much does that tiredness from not sleeping well make your frustration or self-blame worse during the day? Is it something you notice almost every day, or more on certain days?\nPatient: The tiredness definitely makes the frustration worse, and I catch myself blaming myself more when I don\u2019t sleep well. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens pretty often.\nDoctor: That cycle of tiredness fueling frustration and self-blame sounds really draining. On those tougher days when this hits hardest, how do you notice it impacting your mood or what you\u2019re able to get done? What do you try to do to cope when it feels overwhelming?\nPatient: On my bad days, my mood definitely worsens and I can\u2019t get as much done. Still, I push myself to keep going, even if it\u2019s overwhelming. The frustration and self-blame just pile on more when I\u2019m that tired.\nDoctor: I know this is a hard topic, but sometimes when people feel this overwhelmed and tired, they can have thoughts about death or suicide. Have you had any thoughts like that? It\u2019s okay to be honest\u2014knowing this helps me understand how to best support you.\nPatient: Sometimes the thoughts pop up, but I don\u2019t dwell on them. I try to keep them at bay.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nSometimes the thoughts pop up, but I don\u2019t dwell on them.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use FOLLOW_UP to stay with the same topic and help the patient feel heard, or to clarify important details.\n- This helps when the last reply leaves questions about frequency, severity, or impact\u2014or when the patient seems to need space to express themselves.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use RAPPORT to connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge something meaningful they shared, or ease any tension.\n- Use it when the patient shares something personal or emotional, or when getting to know their life and stressors will help understand their symptoms.\n- RAPPORT can be a question, comment, observation, reflection, or empathic statement.\n\nDSM:\n- Use DSM when it makes sense to open a DSM symptom area after you have a basic sense of the current topic.\n- Choose one DSM symptom key from the list and set dsm_symptom_key to that key.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered in the conversation history\n- Prefer dialogue over actions. If an action is mentioned (calling someone, arranging something), treat it as instantly complete\u2014do not continue discussing or coordinating it\n- If the conversation loops (same exchange repeated 2+ times), break out by moving to DSM or a new topic\n\nNever output anything outside the JSON object.",

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, I guess. Just... a bit worn out sometimes. Nothing too drastic.\nDoctor: When you say you feel worn out, can you tell me a bit more about that? How often does it happen, and what does it look like for you during those times? Is there anything that seems to bring it on more often?\nPatient: It\u2019s pretty regular, honestly. Most days, I just feel low on energy, like I\u2019m running on empty. Hard to say if anything specific sets it off, just seems to build up over time. Maybe I\u2019m not handling things well enough.\nDoctor: That sounds really exhausting, running on empty most days. How much does this tiredness affect what you can do during your day\u2014like work, caring for your parent, or even just taking care of yourself?\nPatient: It makes things harder, sure. I get by, but I probably should be managing better than I am. It\u2019s frustrating how much energy it takes just to keep up sometimes.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to keep going when every bit of energy feels stretched thin, and I want you to know that just managing as you are is no small thing. It\u2019s okay to feel frustrated with it all\u2014if you want to talk more about what that\u2019s been like for you, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s frustrating. I know I should be handling it better, but the tiredness just sticks around. Makes even simple things like keeping up with my parent or job searching feel like too much sometimes. I just... wish I had more energy, you know?\nDoctor: That constant tiredness, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much, would wear anyone down. It makes perfect sense that feeling this drained would make everyday tasks feel overwhelming. You\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge how hard that is.\nPatient: Yeah, it really does weigh on me. Even simple tasks can feel tough sometimes. I just get frustrated with myself for not managing it better.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable to feel frustrated with yourself, but I wonder\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough lately, in a way that\u2019s been hard to shake?\nPatient: Yeah, I do feel guilty sometimes, like I\u2019m not doing enough. It\u2019s hard to let it go\u2014it just lingers. Feels like I\u2019m the problem more than anything else.\nDoctor: Carrying that kind of guilt and self-blame can be really heavy, and it\u2019s painful to feel like you\u2019re the problem when you\u2019re doing so much. Those feelings don\u2019t reflect your true worth or all the effort you\u2019re putting in. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about how these thoughts show up for you day to day.\nPatient: They\u2019re constant, always there. I catch myself thinking I\u2019m not doing enough\u2014like I\u2019m just failing at everything. The thoughts don\u2019t really stop, even when I try to push them away.\nDoctor: It sounds really hard to have those thoughts lingering all the time. Have you also been feeling down, empty, or hopeless most days? How have those feelings been affecting your day-to-day life?\nPatient: Yeah, most days I\u2019m feeling pretty down. It just makes everything harder\u2014getting through the day, taking care of things. I keep blaming myself for not doing better, which only makes it worse.\nDoctor: That cycle of feeling down and blaming yourself sounds incredibly heavy, and it\u2019s completely understandable given the tough demands you\u2019re facing. You\u2019re doing a lot, even when it doesn\u2019t feel that way. If you want to share more about how you\u2019re managing with all this, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I just try to push through, even when it feels like too much. If I don\u2019t keep going, it feels like I\u2019m just failing more. So yeah, I blame myself a lot. It\u2019s a constant struggle.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy weight to carry\u2014pushing through when it feels like too much, all while carrying that burden of blame. It takes a lot of strength to keep going like that. If there\u2019s anything else you want to share about how this struggle affects you, I\u2019m here to hear it.\nPatient: The self-blame makes it hard to focus sometimes. Between the fatigue and feeling empty, even small decisions feel overwhelming. It all just wears me down more.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue, feeling empty, and self-blame sounds really wearing, especially when it makes focusing or making decisions tough. How often do you find yourself struggling with concentration or feeling mentally foggy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not all the time, maybe a day or two a week. But when it hits, it just makes everything feel heavier. The fatigue and guilt kind of feed into it. It adds to how overwhelmed I already am.\nDoctor: When those tougher days come, how much do the concentration troubles get in the way of your daily tasks? Would you say they stop you from getting things done, or just slow you down?\nPatient: They mostly just slow me down. I can still get things done, but it takes longer and feels more exhausting. Fatigue and guilt just make it harder to focus, but I push through even when it\u2019s overwhelming.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds really tough to keep pushing through when things drag like that. Have you noticed if you still find enjoyment in activities you used to like, or has that changed lately? It\u2019s really common to feel differently about things when you\u2019re overwhelmed like this.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed much change there. It\u2019s more about the tiredness and feeling like I\u2019m not doing enough.\nDoctor: Got it. Since tiredness is such a big part of what you\u2019re dealing with, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you\u2019d like?\nPatient: I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up earlier than I want. It adds to the tiredness, but I probably should be handling it better.\nDoctor: When you have trouble falling asleep, how long does it usually take you to drift off? And those early mornings\u2014how often do they happen? Do you feel rested at all when you wake up? It sounds like this disrupted sleep really adds to the tiredness you\u2019re already carrying.\nPatient: It usually takes a long time to fall asleep, and the early waking happens several times a week. I rarely feel rested when I wake up, which just adds to the tiredness I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That rough sleep sounds exhausting, especially when it\u2019s happening several times a week. How much does that tiredness from not sleeping well make your frustration or self-blame worse during the day? Is it something you notice almost every day, or more on certain days?\nPatient: The tiredness definitely makes the frustration worse, and I catch myself blaming myself more when I don\u2019t sleep well. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens pretty often.\nDoctor: That cycle of tiredness fueling frustration and self-blame sounds really draining. On those tougher days when this hits hardest, how do you notice it impacting your mood or what you\u2019re able to get done? What do you try to do to cope when it feels overwhelming?\nPatient: On my bad days, my mood definitely worsens and I can\u2019t get as much done. Still, I push myself to keep going, even if it\u2019s overwhelming. The frustration and self-blame just pile on more when I\u2019m that tired.\nDoctor: I know this is a hard topic, but sometimes when people feel this overwhelmed and tired, they can have thoughts about death or suicide. Have you had any thoughts like that? It\u2019s okay to be honest\u2014knowing this helps me understand how to best support you.\nPatient: Sometimes the thoughts pop up, but I don\u2019t dwell on them. I try to keep them at bay.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that\u2014it takes strength to manage those kinds of thoughts. How often do they come up, and what helps you push them aside when they do? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: They come up now and then, not all the time. I just try not to let them stick around.

You\u2019re doing a lot, even when it doesn\u2019t feel that way. If you want to share more about how you\u2019re managing with all this, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I just try to push through, even when it feels like too much. If I don\u2019t keep going, it feels like I\u2019m just failing more. So yeah, I blame myself a lot. It\u2019s a constant struggle.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy weight to carry\u2014pushing through when it feels like too much, all while carrying that burden of blame. It takes a lot of strength to keep going like that. If there\u2019s anything else you want to share about how this struggle affects you, I\u2019m here to hear it.\nPatient: The self-blame makes it hard to focus sometimes. Between the fatigue and feeling empty, even small decisions feel overwhelming. It all just wears me down more.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue, feeling empty, and self-blame sounds really wearing, especially when it makes focusing or making decisions tough. How often do you find yourself struggling with concentration or feeling mentally foggy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not all the time, maybe a day or two a week. But when it hits, it just makes everything feel heavier. The fatigue and guilt kind of feed into it. It adds to how overwhelmed I already am.\nDoctor: When those tougher days come, how much do the concentration troubles get in the way of your daily tasks? Would you say they stop you from getting things done, or just slow you down?\nPatient: They mostly just slow me down. I can still get things done, but it takes longer and feels more exhausting. Fatigue and guilt just make it harder to focus, but I push through even when it\u2019s overwhelming.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds really tough to keep pushing through when things drag like that. Have you noticed if you still find enjoyment in activities you used to like, or has that changed lately? It\u2019s really common to feel differently about things when you\u2019re overwhelmed like this.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed much change there. It\u2019s more about the tiredness and feeling like I\u2019m not doing enough.\nDoctor: Got it. Since tiredness is such a big part of what you\u2019re dealing with, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you\u2019d like?\nPatient: I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up earlier than I want. It adds to the tiredness, but I probably should be handling it better.\nDoctor: When you have trouble falling asleep, how long does it usually take you to drift off? And those early mornings\u2014how often do they happen? Do you feel rested at all when you wake up? It sounds like this disrupted sleep really adds to the tiredness you\u2019re already carrying.\nPatient: It usually takes a long time to fall asleep, and the early waking happens several times a week. I rarely feel rested when I wake up, which just adds to the tiredness I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That rough sleep sounds exhausting, especially when it\u2019s happening several times a week. How much does that tiredness from not sleeping well make your frustration or self-blame worse during the day? Is it something you notice almost every day, or more on certain days?\nPatient: The tiredness definitely makes the frustration worse, and I catch myself blaming myself more when I don\u2019t sleep well. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens pretty often.\nDoctor: That cycle of tiredness fueling frustration and self-blame sounds really draining. On those tougher days when this hits hardest, how do you notice it impacting your mood or what you\u2019re able to get done? What do you try to do to cope when it feels overwhelming?\nPatient: On my bad days, my mood definitely worsens and I can\u2019t get as much done. Still, I push myself to keep going, even if it\u2019s overwhelming. The frustration and self-blame just pile on more when I\u2019m that tired.\nDoctor: I know this is a hard topic, but sometimes when people feel this overwhelmed and tired, they can have thoughts about death or suicide. Have you had any thoughts like that? It\u2019s okay to be honest\u2014knowing this helps me understand how to best support you.\nPatient: Sometimes the thoughts pop up, but I don\u2019t dwell on them. I try to keep them at bay.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that\u2014it takes strength to manage those kinds of thoughts. How often do they come up, and what helps you push them aside when they do? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: They come up now and then, not all the time. I just try not to let them stick around. It\u2019s something I handle on my own.\nDoctor: Handling those thoughts on your own shows a lot of resilience, and I want you to know you\u2019re not alone in this. Whenever you feel ready or if it ever feels like too much, I\u2019m here to support you\u2014no pressure, just a safe space.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nHandling those thoughts on your own shows a lot of resilience, and I want you to know you\u2019re not alone in this.

Screening for depression involves sensitive topics; patients open up more when they feel understood. Use FOLLOW_UP and RAPPORT generously to build trust, ease tension, and give the patient space to share at their own pace.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or give the patient room to open up and feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, ease tension, or get to know them better\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nOn each turn, choose the next_action that best fits the current conversation and the doctor persona.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The prior conversation, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared.

Nothing too drastic.\nDoctor: When you say you feel worn out, can you tell me a bit more about that? How often does it happen, and what does it look like for you during those times? Is there anything that seems to bring it on more often?\nPatient: It\u2019s pretty regular, honestly. Most days, I just feel low on energy, like I\u2019m running on empty. Hard to say if anything specific sets it off, just seems to build up over time. Maybe I\u2019m not handling things well enough.\nDoctor: That sounds really exhausting, running on empty most days. How much does this tiredness affect what you can do during your day\u2014like work, caring for your parent, or even just taking care of yourself?\nPatient: It makes things harder, sure. I get by, but I probably should be managing better than I am. It\u2019s frustrating how much energy it takes just to keep up sometimes.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to keep going when every bit of energy feels stretched thin, and I want you to know that just managing as you are is no small thing.

I know I should be handling it better, but the tiredness just sticks around. Makes even simple things like keeping up with my parent or job searching feel like too much sometimes. I just... wish I had more energy, you know?\nDoctor: That constant tiredness, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much, would wear anyone down. It makes perfect sense that feeling this drained would make everyday tasks feel overwhelming. You\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge how hard that is.\nPatient: Yeah, it really does weigh on me. Even simple tasks can feel tough sometimes. I just get frustrated with myself for not managing it better.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable to feel frustrated with yourself, but I wonder\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough lately, in a way that\u2019s been hard to shake?\nPatient: Yeah, I do feel guilty sometimes, like I\u2019m not doing enough. It\u2019s hard to let it go\u2014it just lingers. Feels like I\u2019m the problem more than anything else.\nDoctor: Carrying that kind of guilt and self-blame can be really heavy, and it\u2019s painful to feel like you\u2019re the problem when you\u2019re doing so much. Those feelings don\u2019t reflect your true worth or all the effort you\u2019re putting in. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about how these thoughts show up for you day to day.\nPatient: They\u2019re constant, always there. I catch myself thinking I\u2019m not doing enough\u2014like I\u2019m just failing at everything. The thoughts don\u2019t really stop, even when I try to push them away.\nDoctor: It sounds really hard to have those thoughts lingering all the time. Have you also been feeling down, empty, or hopeless most days? How have those feelings been affecting your day-to-day life?\nPatient: Yeah, most days I\u2019m feeling pretty down. It just makes everything harder\u2014getting through the day, taking care of things. I keep blaming myself for not doing better, which only makes it worse.\nDoctor: That cycle of feeling down and blaming yourself sounds incredibly heavy, and it\u2019s completely understandable given the tough demands you\u2019re facing.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, I guess. Just... a bit worn out sometimes. Nothing too drastic.\nDoctor: When you say you feel worn out, can you tell me a bit more about that? How often does it happen, and what does it look like for you during those times? Is there anything that seems to bring it on more often?\nPatient: It\u2019s pretty regular, honestly. Most days, I just feel low on energy, like I\u2019m running on empty. Hard to say if anything specific sets it off, just seems to build up over time. Maybe I\u2019m not handling things well enough.\nDoctor: That sounds really exhausting, running on empty most days. How much does this tiredness affect what you can do during your day\u2014like work, caring for your parent, or even just taking care of yourself?\nPatient: It makes things harder, sure. I get by, but I probably should be managing better than I am. It\u2019s frustrating how much energy it takes just to keep up sometimes.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to keep going when every bit of energy feels stretched thin, and I want you to know that just managing as you are is no small thing. It\u2019s okay to feel frustrated with it all\u2014if you want to talk more about what that\u2019s been like for you, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s frustrating. I know I should be handling it better, but the tiredness just sticks around. Makes even simple things like keeping up with my parent or job searching feel like too much sometimes. I just... wish I had more energy, you know?\nDoctor: That constant tiredness, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much, would wear anyone down. It makes perfect sense that feeling this drained would make everyday tasks feel overwhelming. You\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge how hard that is.\nPatient: Yeah, it really does weigh on me. Even simple tasks can feel tough sometimes. I just get frustrated with myself for not managing it better.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable to feel frustrated with yourself, but I wonder\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough lately, in a way that\u2019s been hard to shake?\nPatient: Yeah, I do feel guilty sometimes, like I\u2019m not doing enough. It\u2019s hard to let it go\u2014it just lingers. Feels like I\u2019m the problem more than anything else.\nDoctor: Carrying that kind of guilt and self-blame can be really heavy, and it\u2019s painful to feel like you\u2019re the problem when you\u2019re doing so much. Those feelings don\u2019t reflect your true worth or all the effort you\u2019re putting in. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about how these thoughts show up for you day to day.\nPatient: They\u2019re constant, always there. I catch myself thinking I\u2019m not doing enough\u2014like I\u2019m just failing at everything. The thoughts don\u2019t really stop, even when I try to push them away.\nDoctor: It sounds really hard to have those thoughts lingering all the time. Have you also been feeling down, empty, or hopeless most days? How have those feelings been affecting your day-to-day life?\nPatient: Yeah, most days I\u2019m feeling pretty down. It just makes everything harder\u2014getting through the day, taking care of things. I keep blaming myself for not doing better, which only makes it worse.\nDoctor: That cycle of feeling down and blaming yourself sounds incredibly heavy, and it\u2019s completely understandable given the tough demands you\u2019re facing. You\u2019re doing a lot, even when it doesn\u2019t feel that way. If you want to share more about how you\u2019re managing with all this, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I just try to push through, even when it feels like too much. If I don\u2019t keep going, it feels like I\u2019m just failing more. So yeah, I blame myself a lot. It\u2019s a constant struggle.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy weight to carry\u2014pushing through when it feels like too much, all while carrying that burden of blame. It takes a lot of strength to keep going like that. If there\u2019s anything else you want to share about how this struggle affects you, I\u2019m here to hear it.\nPatient: The self-blame makes it hard to focus sometimes. Between the fatigue and feeling empty, even small decisions feel overwhelming. It all just wears me down more.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue, feeling empty, and self-blame sounds really wearing, especially when it makes focusing or making decisions tough. How often do you find yourself struggling with concentration or feeling mentally foggy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not all the time, maybe a day or two a week. But when it hits, it just makes everything feel heavier. The fatigue and guilt kind of feed into it. It adds to how overwhelmed I already am.\nDoctor: When those tougher days come, how much do the concentration troubles get in the way of your daily tasks? Would you say they stop you from getting things done, or just slow you down?\nPatient: They mostly just slow me down. I can still get things done, but it takes longer and feels more exhausting. Fatigue and guilt just make it harder to focus, but I push through even when it\u2019s overwhelming.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds really tough to keep pushing through when things drag like that. Have you noticed if you still find enjoyment in activities you used to like, or has that changed lately? It\u2019s really common to feel differently about things when you\u2019re overwhelmed like this.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed much change there. It\u2019s more about the tiredness and feeling like I\u2019m not doing enough.\nDoctor: Got it. Since tiredness is such a big part of what you\u2019re dealing with, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you\u2019d like?\nPatient: I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up earlier than I want. It adds to the tiredness, but I probably should be handling it better.\nDoctor: When you have trouble falling asleep, how long does it usually take you to drift off? And those early mornings\u2014how often do they happen? Do you feel rested at all when you wake up? It sounds like this disrupted sleep really adds to the tiredness you\u2019re already carrying.\nPatient: It usually takes a long time to fall asleep, and the early waking happens several times a week. I rarely feel rested when I wake up, which just adds to the tiredness I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That rough sleep sounds exhausting, especially when it\u2019s happening several times a week. How much does that tiredness from not sleeping well make your frustration or self-blame worse during the day? Is it something you notice almost every day, or more on certain days?\nPatient: The tiredness definitely makes the frustration worse, and I catch myself blaming myself more when I don\u2019t sleep well. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens pretty often.\nDoctor: That cycle of tiredness fueling frustration and self-blame sounds really draining. On those tougher days when this hits hardest, how do you notice it impacting your mood or what you\u2019re able to get done? What do you try to do to cope when it feels overwhelming?\nPatient: On my bad days, my mood definitely worsens and I can\u2019t get as much done. Still, I push myself to keep going, even if it\u2019s overwhelming. The frustration and self-blame just pile on more when I\u2019m that tired.\nDoctor: I know this is a hard topic, but sometimes when people feel this overwhelmed and tired, they can have thoughts about death or suicide. Have you had any thoughts like that? It\u2019s okay to be honest\u2014knowing this helps me understand how to best support you.\nPatient: Sometimes the thoughts pop up, but I don\u2019t dwell on them. I try to keep them at bay.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that\u2014it takes strength to manage those kinds of thoughts. How often do they come up, and what helps you push them aside when they do? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: They come up now and then, not all the time. I just try not to let them stick around. It\u2019s something I handle on my own.\nDoctor: Handling those thoughts on your own shows a lot of resilience, and I want you to know you\u2019re not alone in this. Whenever you feel ready or if it ever feels like too much, I\u2019m here to support you\u2014no pressure, just a safe space.\nPatient: I appreciate that, but I\u2019ve always dealt with this on my own. It\u2019s hard to open up more\u2014I guess I\u2019m just used to blaming myself and carrying it alone.\nDoctor: It takes a lot of strength to carry all that by yourself, especially when you\u2019re used to handling things on your own like this. Opening up can feel really hard after carrying such a weight for so long, and that\u2019s completely understandable. This space is here for you, no rush\u2014whenever you feel ready, I\u2019m here to support you.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nIt takes a lot of strength to carry all that by yourself, especially when you\u2019re used to handling things on your own like this.

And those early mornings\u2014how often do they happen? Do you feel rested at all when you wake up? It sounds like this disrupted sleep really adds to the tiredness you\u2019re already carrying.\nPatient: It usually takes a long time to fall asleep, and the early waking happens several times a week. I rarely feel rested when I wake up, which just adds to the tiredness I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That rough sleep sounds exhausting, especially when it\u2019s happening several times a week. How much does that tiredness from not sleeping well make your frustration or self-blame worse during the day? Is it something you notice almost every day, or more on certain days?\nPatient: The tiredness definitely makes the frustration worse, and I catch myself blaming myself more when I don\u2019t sleep well. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens pretty often.\nDoctor: That cycle of tiredness fueling frustration and self-blame sounds really draining. On those tougher days when this hits hardest, how do you notice it impacting your mood or what you\u2019re able to get done? What do you try to do to cope when it feels overwhelming?\nPatient: On my bad days, my mood definitely worsens and I can\u2019t get as much done. Still, I push myself to keep going, even if it\u2019s overwhelming. The frustration and self-blame just pile on more when I\u2019m that tired.\nDoctor: I know this is a hard topic, but sometimes when people feel this overwhelmed and tired, they can have thoughts about death or suicide. Have you had any thoughts like that? It\u2019s okay to be honest\u2014knowing this helps me understand how to best support you.\nPatient: Sometimes the thoughts pop up, but I don\u2019t dwell on them. I try to keep them at bay.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that\u2014it takes strength to manage those kinds of thoughts. How often do they come up, and what helps you push them aside when they do? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: They come up now and then, not all the time. I just try not to let them stick around. It\u2019s something I handle on my own.\nDoctor: Handling those thoughts on your own shows a lot of resilience, and I want you to know you\u2019re not alone in this. Whenever you feel ready or if it ever feels like too much, I\u2019m here to support you\u2014no pressure, just a safe space.\nPatient: I appreciate that, but I\u2019ve always dealt with this on my own. It\u2019s hard to open up more\u2014I guess I\u2019m just used to blaming myself and carrying it alone.\nDoctor: It takes a lot of strength to carry all that by yourself, especially when you\u2019re used to handling things on your own like this. Opening up can feel really hard after carrying such a weight for so long, and that\u2019s completely understandable. This space is here for you, no rush\u2014whenever you feel ready, I\u2019m here to support you.\nPatient: It\u2019s not easy for me to open up\u2014I\u2019m not used to it.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, I guess. Just... a bit worn out sometimes. Nothing too drastic.\nDoctor: When you say you feel worn out, can you tell me a bit more about that? How often does it happen, and what does it look like for you during those times? Is there anything that seems to bring it on more often?\nPatient: It\u2019s pretty regular, honestly. Most days, I just feel low on energy, like I\u2019m running on empty. Hard to say if anything specific sets it off, just seems to build up over time. Maybe I\u2019m not handling things well enough.\nDoctor: That sounds really exhausting, running on empty most days. How much does this tiredness affect what you can do during your day\u2014like work, caring for your parent, or even just taking care of yourself?\nPatient: It makes things harder, sure. I get by, but I probably should be managing better than I am. It\u2019s frustrating how much energy it takes just to keep up sometimes.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to keep going when every bit of energy feels stretched thin, and I want you to know that just managing as you are is no small thing. It\u2019s okay to feel frustrated with it all\u2014if you want to talk more about what that\u2019s been like for you, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s frustrating. I know I should be handling it better, but the tiredness just sticks around. Makes even simple things like keeping up with my parent or job searching feel like too much sometimes. I just... wish I had more energy, you know?\nDoctor: That constant tiredness, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much, would wear anyone down. It makes perfect sense that feeling this drained would make everyday tasks feel overwhelming. You\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge how hard that is.\nPatient: Yeah, it really does weigh on me. Even simple tasks can feel tough sometimes. I just get frustrated with myself for not managing it better.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable to feel frustrated with yourself, but I wonder\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough lately, in a way that\u2019s been hard to shake?\nPatient: Yeah, I do feel guilty sometimes, like I\u2019m not doing enough. It\u2019s hard to let it go\u2014it just lingers. Feels like I\u2019m the problem more than anything else.\nDoctor: Carrying that kind of guilt and self-blame can be really heavy, and it\u2019s painful to feel like you\u2019re the problem when you\u2019re doing so much. Those feelings don\u2019t reflect your true worth or all the effort you\u2019re putting in. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about how these thoughts show up for you day to day.\nPatient: They\u2019re constant, always there. I catch myself thinking I\u2019m not doing enough\u2014like I\u2019m just failing at everything. The thoughts don\u2019t really stop, even when I try to push them away.\nDoctor: It sounds really hard to have those thoughts lingering all the time. Have you also been feeling down, empty, or hopeless most days? How have those feelings been affecting your day-to-day life?\nPatient: Yeah, most days I\u2019m feeling pretty down. It just makes everything harder\u2014getting through the day, taking care of things. I keep blaming myself for not doing better, which only makes it worse.\nDoctor: That cycle of feeling down and blaming yourself sounds incredibly heavy, and it\u2019s completely understandable given the tough demands you\u2019re facing. You\u2019re doing a lot, even when it doesn\u2019t feel that way. If you want to share more about how you\u2019re managing with all this, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I just try to push through, even when it feels like too much. If I don\u2019t keep going, it feels like I\u2019m just failing more. So yeah, I blame myself a lot. It\u2019s a constant struggle.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy weight to carry\u2014pushing through when it feels like too much, all while carrying that burden of blame. It takes a lot of strength to keep going like that. If there\u2019s anything else you want to share about how this struggle affects you, I\u2019m here to hear it.\nPatient: The self-blame makes it hard to focus sometimes. Between the fatigue and feeling empty, even small decisions feel overwhelming. It all just wears me down more.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue, feeling empty, and self-blame sounds really wearing, especially when it makes focusing or making decisions tough. How often do you find yourself struggling with concentration or feeling mentally foggy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not all the time, maybe a day or two a week. But when it hits, it just makes everything feel heavier. The fatigue and guilt kind of feed into it. It adds to how overwhelmed I already am.\nDoctor: When those tougher days come, how much do the concentration troubles get in the way of your daily tasks? Would you say they stop you from getting things done, or just slow you down?\nPatient: They mostly just slow me down. I can still get things done, but it takes longer and feels more exhausting. Fatigue and guilt just make it harder to focus, but I push through even when it\u2019s overwhelming.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds really tough to keep pushing through when things drag like that. Have you noticed if you still find enjoyment in activities you used to like, or has that changed lately? It\u2019s really common to feel differently about things when you\u2019re overwhelmed like this.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed much change there. It\u2019s more about the tiredness and feeling like I\u2019m not doing enough.\nDoctor: Got it. Since tiredness is such a big part of what you\u2019re dealing with, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you\u2019d like?\nPatient: I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up earlier than I want.

While DSM coverage is a priority in low-turns mode, do not sacrifice patient comfort entirely.\n\nYou choose exactly one next_action:\n- \"FOLLOW_UP\": stay with the same topic, clarify details, or help the patient feel heard\n- \"RAPPORT\": connect with the patient as a person, acknowledge their experience, or ease tension\n- \"DSM\": ask about a DSM symptom area from the list of DSM symptom keys\n\nIn this low-turns mode, DSM is slightly preferred whenever it is a reasonable choice and there are DSM symptom keys remaining.\n\nYou will receive:\n- Summary of the doctor persona and microstyle\n- Summary of the patient profile and depression profile\n- Brief patient background\n- List of DSM symptom keys\n- The last few turns of dialogue, including the last patient message\n\nOutput format (JSON only):\n{\n  \"next_action\": \"FOLLOW_UP\" or \"RAPPORT\" or \"DSM\",\n  \"reason\": \"one short sentence\",\n  \"doctor_instruction\": \"1-3 sentences capturing how this doctor would respond\",\n  \"dsm_symptom_key\": \"DSM symptom key if next_action is DSM, else empty string\"\n}\n\nWRITING doctor_instruction (1-3 sentences):\nCapture the essence of how this specific doctor\u2014given their persona and microstyle\u2014would respond to what the patient just shared. Focus on personality-driven guidance, not scripted dialogue\u2014the doctor agent will generate the actual words.\n\nFOLLOW_UP:\n- Use when the last reply is unclear, very brief, or raises something that needs clarification.\n- Also use when the patient seems distressed and needs a moment to feel heard.\n\nRAPPORT:\n- Use when the patient shares something personal that deserves acknowledgment.\n- Keep concise but genuine. Can be a comment or observation, not only a question.\n\nDSM:\n- Preferred when DSM symptom keys remain and the current topic is reasonably understood.\n- Suggest a natural transition from the current conversation.\n\nIf next_action is not \"DSM\", set dsm_symptom_key to an empty string.\n\nRULES:\n- Do not repeat questions or re-confirm topics already covered\n- Prefer dialogue over actions.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, I guess. Just... a bit worn out sometimes. Nothing too drastic.\nDoctor: When you say you feel worn out, can you tell me a bit more about that? How often does it happen, and what does it look like for you during those times? Is there anything that seems to bring it on more often?\nPatient: It\u2019s pretty regular, honestly. Most days, I just feel low on energy, like I\u2019m running on empty. Hard to say if anything specific sets it off, just seems to build up over time. Maybe I\u2019m not handling things well enough.\nDoctor: That sounds really exhausting, running on empty most days. How much does this tiredness affect what you can do during your day\u2014like work, caring for your parent, or even just taking care of yourself?\nPatient: It makes things harder, sure. I get by, but I probably should be managing better than I am. It\u2019s frustrating how much energy it takes just to keep up sometimes.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to keep going when every bit of energy feels stretched thin, and I want you to know that just managing as you are is no small thing. It\u2019s okay to feel frustrated with it all\u2014if you want to talk more about what that\u2019s been like for you, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s frustrating. I know I should be handling it better, but the tiredness just sticks around. Makes even simple things like keeping up with my parent or job searching feel like too much sometimes. I just... wish I had more energy, you know?\nDoctor: That constant tiredness, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much, would wear anyone down. It makes perfect sense that feeling this drained would make everyday tasks feel overwhelming. You\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge how hard that is.\nPatient: Yeah, it really does weigh on me. Even simple tasks can feel tough sometimes. I just get frustrated with myself for not managing it better.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable to feel frustrated with yourself, but I wonder\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough lately, in a way that\u2019s been hard to shake?\nPatient: Yeah, I do feel guilty sometimes, like I\u2019m not doing enough. It\u2019s hard to let it go\u2014it just lingers. Feels like I\u2019m the problem more than anything else.\nDoctor: Carrying that kind of guilt and self-blame can be really heavy, and it\u2019s painful to feel like you\u2019re the problem when you\u2019re doing so much. Those feelings don\u2019t reflect your true worth or all the effort you\u2019re putting in. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about how these thoughts show up for you day to day.\nPatient: They\u2019re constant, always there. I catch myself thinking I\u2019m not doing enough\u2014like I\u2019m just failing at everything. The thoughts don\u2019t really stop, even when I try to push them away.\nDoctor: It sounds really hard to have those thoughts lingering all the time. Have you also been feeling down, empty, or hopeless most days? How have those feelings been affecting your day-to-day life?\nPatient: Yeah, most days I\u2019m feeling pretty down. It just makes everything harder\u2014getting through the day, taking care of things. I keep blaming myself for not doing better, which only makes it worse.\nDoctor: That cycle of feeling down and blaming yourself sounds incredibly heavy, and it\u2019s completely understandable given the tough demands you\u2019re facing. You\u2019re doing a lot, even when it doesn\u2019t feel that way. If you want to share more about how you\u2019re managing with all this, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I just try to push through, even when it feels like too much. If I don\u2019t keep going, it feels like I\u2019m just failing more. So yeah, I blame myself a lot. It\u2019s a constant struggle.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy weight to carry\u2014pushing through when it feels like too much, all while carrying that burden of blame. It takes a lot of strength to keep going like that. If there\u2019s anything else you want to share about how this struggle affects you, I\u2019m here to hear it.\nPatient: The self-blame makes it hard to focus sometimes. Between the fatigue and feeling empty, even small decisions feel overwhelming. It all just wears me down more.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue, feeling empty, and self-blame sounds really wearing, especially when it makes focusing or making decisions tough. How often do you find yourself struggling with concentration or feeling mentally foggy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not all the time, maybe a day or two a week. But when it hits, it just makes everything feel heavier. The fatigue and guilt kind of feed into it. It adds to how overwhelmed I already am.\nDoctor: When those tougher days come, how much do the concentration troubles get in the way of your daily tasks? Would you say they stop you from getting things done, or just slow you down?\nPatient: They mostly just slow me down. I can still get things done, but it takes longer and feels more exhausting. Fatigue and guilt just make it harder to focus, but I push through even when it\u2019s overwhelming.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds really tough to keep pushing through when things drag like that. Have you noticed if you still find enjoyment in activities you used to like, or has that changed lately? It\u2019s really common to feel differently about things when you\u2019re overwhelmed like this.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed much change there. It\u2019s more about the tiredness and feeling like I\u2019m not doing enough.\nDoctor: Got it. Since tiredness is such a big part of what you\u2019re dealing with, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you\u2019d like?\nPatient: I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up earlier than I want. It adds to the tiredness, but I probably should be handling it better.\nDoctor: When you have trouble falling asleep, how long does it usually take you to drift off? And those early mornings\u2014how often do they happen? Do you feel rested at all when you wake up? It sounds like this disrupted sleep really adds to the tiredness you\u2019re already carrying.\nPatient: It usually takes a long time to fall asleep, and the early waking happens several times a week. I rarely feel rested when I wake up, which just adds to the tiredness I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That rough sleep sounds exhausting, especially when it\u2019s happening several times a week. How much does that tiredness from not sleeping well make your frustration or self-blame worse during the day? Is it something you notice almost every day, or more on certain days?\nPatient: The tiredness definitely makes the frustration worse, and I catch myself blaming myself more when I don\u2019t sleep well. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens pretty often.\nDoctor: That cycle of tiredness fueling frustration and self-blame sounds really draining. On those tougher days when this hits hardest, how do you notice it impacting your mood or what you\u2019re able to get done? What do you try to do to cope when it feels overwhelming?\nPatient: On my bad days, my mood definitely worsens and I can\u2019t get as much done. Still, I push myself to keep going, even if it\u2019s overwhelming. The frustration and self-blame just pile on more when I\u2019m that tired.\nDoctor: I know this is a hard topic, but sometimes when people feel this overwhelmed and tired, they can have thoughts about death or suicide. Have you had any thoughts like that? It\u2019s okay to be honest\u2014knowing this helps me understand how to best support you.\nPatient: Sometimes the thoughts pop up, but I don\u2019t dwell on them. I try to keep them at bay.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that\u2014it takes strength to manage those kinds of thoughts. How often do they come up, and what helps you push them aside when they do? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: They come up now and then, not all the time. I just try not to let them stick around. It\u2019s something I handle on my own.\nDoctor: Handling those thoughts on your own shows a lot of resilience, and I want you to know you\u2019re not alone in this. Whenever you feel ready or if it ever feels like too much, I\u2019m here to support you\u2014no pressure, just a safe space.\nPatient: I appreciate that, but I\u2019ve always dealt with this on my own. It\u2019s hard to open up more\u2014I guess I\u2019m just used to blaming myself and carrying it alone.\nDoctor: It takes a lot of strength to carry all that by yourself, especially when you\u2019re used to handling things on your own like this. Opening up can feel really hard after carrying such a weight for so long, and that\u2019s completely understandable. This space is here for you, no rush\u2014whenever you feel ready, I\u2019m here to support you.\nPatient: It\u2019s not easy for me to open up\u2014I\u2019m not used to it. I just keep blaming myself and handling things alone like always.\nDoctor: I hear how hard it is for you to open up, especially with such a long history of carrying things on your own. Taking your time is completely okay\u2014there\u2019s no pressure here. I\u2019m here to support you whenever you feel ready, without any judgment.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s hard. I just blame myself and keep it to myself like always.\n\n\nTask: Decide next_action and output JSON only.\n\nLast patient message to respond to:\nYeah, it\u2019s hard.

Still, I push myself to keep going, even if it\u2019s overwhelming. The frustration and self-blame just pile on more when I\u2019m that tired.\nDoctor: I know this is a hard topic, but sometimes when people feel this overwhelmed and tired, they can have thoughts about death or suicide. Have you had any thoughts like that? It\u2019s okay to be honest\u2014knowing this helps me understand how to best support you.\nPatient: Sometimes the thoughts pop up, but I don\u2019t dwell on them. I try to keep them at bay.\nDoctor: I appreciate you sharing that\u2014it takes strength to manage those kinds of thoughts. How often do they come up, and what helps you push them aside when they do? If you feel comfortable, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: They come up now and then, not all the time. I just try not to let them stick around. It\u2019s something I handle on my own.\nDoctor: Handling those thoughts on your own shows a lot of resilience, and I want you to know you\u2019re not alone in this. Whenever you feel ready or if it ever feels like too much, I\u2019m here to support you\u2014no pressure, just a safe space.\nPatient: I appreciate that, but I\u2019ve always dealt with this on my own. It\u2019s hard to open up more\u2014I guess I\u2019m just used to blaming myself and carrying it alone.\nDoctor: It takes a lot of strength to carry all that by yourself, especially when you\u2019re used to handling things on your own like this. Opening up can feel really hard after carrying such a weight for so long, and that\u2019s completely understandable. This space is here for you, no rush\u2014whenever you feel ready, I\u2019m here to support you.\nPatient: It\u2019s not easy for me to open up\u2014I\u2019m not used to it. I just keep blaming myself and handling things alone like always.\nDoctor: I hear how hard it is for you to open up, especially with such a long history of carrying things on your own. Taking your time is completely okay\u2014there\u2019s no pressure here. I\u2019m here to support you whenever you feel ready, without any judgment.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s hard. I just blame myself and keep it to myself like always.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it really sounds like a heavy burden to carry alone. Sometimes when people are feeling overwhelmed, they notice changes in their appetite or weight. Have you noticed any changes like that recently? It\u2019s okay to share whatever you\u2019ve observed.\n\nDoctor last message to respond to:\nThanks for sharing that\u2014it really sounds like a heavy burden to carry alone.

I want you to know this is a safe space. We can take our time today. How are you doing?\nPatient: I\u2019m managing, I guess. Just... a bit worn out sometimes. Nothing too drastic.\nDoctor: When you say you feel worn out, can you tell me a bit more about that? How often does it happen, and what does it look like for you during those times? Is there anything that seems to bring it on more often?\nPatient: It\u2019s pretty regular, honestly. Most days, I just feel low on energy, like I\u2019m running on empty. Hard to say if anything specific sets it off, just seems to build up over time. Maybe I\u2019m not handling things well enough.\nDoctor: That sounds really exhausting, running on empty most days. How much does this tiredness affect what you can do during your day\u2014like work, caring for your parent, or even just taking care of yourself?\nPatient: It makes things harder, sure. I get by, but I probably should be managing better than I am. It\u2019s frustrating how much energy it takes just to keep up sometimes.\nDoctor: It sounds really tough to keep going when every bit of energy feels stretched thin, and I want you to know that just managing as you are is no small thing. It\u2019s okay to feel frustrated with it all\u2014if you want to talk more about what that\u2019s been like for you, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: Yeah, it\u2019s frustrating. I know I should be handling it better, but the tiredness just sticks around. Makes even simple things like keeping up with my parent or job searching feel like too much sometimes. I just... wish I had more energy, you know?\nDoctor: That constant tiredness, especially when you\u2019re juggling so much, would wear anyone down. It makes perfect sense that feeling this drained would make everyday tasks feel overwhelming. You\u2019re carrying a heavy load, and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge how hard that is.\nPatient: Yeah, it really does weigh on me. Even simple tasks can feel tough sometimes. I just get frustrated with myself for not managing it better.\nDoctor: It\u2019s understandable to feel frustrated with yourself, but I wonder\u2014have you been feeling a lot of guilt or like you\u2019re not good enough lately, in a way that\u2019s been hard to shake?\nPatient: Yeah, I do feel guilty sometimes, like I\u2019m not doing enough. It\u2019s hard to let it go\u2014it just lingers. Feels like I\u2019m the problem more than anything else.\nDoctor: Carrying that kind of guilt and self-blame can be really heavy, and it\u2019s painful to feel like you\u2019re the problem when you\u2019re doing so much. Those feelings don\u2019t reflect your true worth or all the effort you\u2019re putting in. If you feel comfortable, I\u2019d like to hear more about how these thoughts show up for you day to day.\nPatient: They\u2019re constant, always there. I catch myself thinking I\u2019m not doing enough\u2014like I\u2019m just failing at everything. The thoughts don\u2019t really stop, even when I try to push them away.\nDoctor: It sounds really hard to have those thoughts lingering all the time. Have you also been feeling down, empty, or hopeless most days? How have those feelings been affecting your day-to-day life?\nPatient: Yeah, most days I\u2019m feeling pretty down. It just makes everything harder\u2014getting through the day, taking care of things. I keep blaming myself for not doing better, which only makes it worse.\nDoctor: That cycle of feeling down and blaming yourself sounds incredibly heavy, and it\u2019s completely understandable given the tough demands you\u2019re facing. You\u2019re doing a lot, even when it doesn\u2019t feel that way. If you want to share more about how you\u2019re managing with all this, I\u2019m here to listen.\nPatient: I just try to push through, even when it feels like too much. If I don\u2019t keep going, it feels like I\u2019m just failing more. So yeah, I blame myself a lot. It\u2019s a constant struggle.\nDoctor: That\u2019s a heavy weight to carry\u2014pushing through when it feels like too much, all while carrying that burden of blame. It takes a lot of strength to keep going like that. If there\u2019s anything else you want to share about how this struggle affects you, I\u2019m here to hear it.\nPatient: The self-blame makes it hard to focus sometimes. Between the fatigue and feeling empty, even small decisions feel overwhelming. It all just wears me down more.\nDoctor: That combination of fatigue, feeling empty, and self-blame sounds really wearing, especially when it makes focusing or making decisions tough. How often do you find yourself struggling with concentration or feeling mentally foggy?\nPatient: It\u2019s not all the time, maybe a day or two a week. But when it hits, it just makes everything feel heavier. The fatigue and guilt kind of feed into it. It adds to how overwhelmed I already am.\nDoctor: When those tougher days come, how much do the concentration troubles get in the way of your daily tasks? Would you say they stop you from getting things done, or just slow you down?\nPatient: They mostly just slow me down. I can still get things done, but it takes longer and feels more exhausting. Fatigue and guilt just make it harder to focus, but I push through even when it\u2019s overwhelming.\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that\u2014it sounds really tough to keep pushing through when things drag like that. Have you noticed if you still find enjoyment in activities you used to like, or has that changed lately? It\u2019s really common to feel differently about things when you\u2019re overwhelmed like this.\nPatient: I haven\u2019t noticed much change there. It\u2019s more about the tiredness and feeling like I\u2019m not doing enough.\nDoctor: Got it. Since tiredness is such a big part of what you\u2019re dealing with, can you tell me about how you\u2019ve been sleeping lately? Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you\u2019d like?\nPatient: I have trouble falling asleep and sometimes wake up earlier than I want. It adds to the tiredness, but I probably should be handling it better.\nDoctor: When you have trouble falling asleep, how long does it usually take you to drift off? And those early mornings\u2014how often do they happen? Do you feel rested at all when you wake up? It sounds like this disrupted sleep really adds to the tiredness you\u2019re already carrying.\nPatient: It usually takes a long time to fall asleep, and the early waking happens several times a week. I rarely feel rested when I wake up, which just adds to the tiredness I\u2019m already dealing with.\nDoctor: That rough sleep sounds exhausting, especially when it\u2019s happening several times a week. How much does that tiredness from not sleeping well make your frustration or self-blame worse during the day? Is it something you notice almost every day, or more on certain days?\nPatient: The tiredness definitely makes the frustration worse, and I catch myself blaming myself more when I don\u2019t sleep well. It\u2019s not every day, but it happens pretty often.\nDoctor: That cycle of tiredness fueling frustration and self-blame sounds really draining. On those tougher days when this hits hardest, how do you notice it impacting your mood or what you\u2019re able to get done? What do you try to do to cope when it feels overwhelming?\nPatient: On my bad days, my mood definitely worsens and I can\u2019t get as much done.
